https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=0.0s	0.0	 The fact that Sachs his greatest moment in life was beating Peter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3.7s	3.7	 Thiel in a multi game chess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5.5s	5.5	 You ever see that picture of, of him with his arms raised and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=9.9s	9.9	 Sachs can't believe he beat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=12.0s	12.0	 I mean, tell us about that moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=13.2s	13.2	 Nick show that picture of Sachs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=14.4s	14.4	 I mean, listen, here's what I say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=15.5s	15.5	 When I saw, when I saw that picture, I had a couple of thoughts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=19.0s	19.0	 Number one, I've seen this picture somewhere else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=22.8s	22.8	 And then number two is, Oh my God, it was on NBC's to catch a predator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=26.5s	26.5	 I mean, I have never seen Sachs happier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=32.3s	32.3	 I like the birth of his children.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=33.8s	33.8	 Oh my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=34.7s	34.7	 In comparison to this moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=36.0s	36.0	 I'll tell you, that was the day of PayPal's IPO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=38.2s	38.2	 And so we did a party in the, it was like a keg party in the parking lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=41.6s	41.6	 That was the extent of the celebration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=43.5s	43.5	 And Peter did a 10 game simultaneous, which means he's playing against
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=48.8s	48.8	 people at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=50.5s	50.5	 And he goes board to board and makes his move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=52.0s	52.0	 And I was the only one out of the 10 that beat him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=54.4s	54.4	 And somebody, I guess I had put money down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=58.0s	58.0	 I put like 20 bucks down or something on the game, which is a foolish thing to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=61.0s	61.0	 against Peter, cause he's like a chess master and, uh, and I, somehow I won and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=67.5s	67.5	 you can see I've got the money in my hands raised up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=70.4s	70.4	 Look at the look on Peter Teal's face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=73.6s	73.6	 Look at the look on P I mean, he's so angry and he, but he sees the joy in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=78.6s	78.6	 your face and he can't process it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=81.7s	81.7	 And look at Max Max's to my right and roll off his right left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=85.1s	85.1	 And they're so happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=86.1s	86.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=86.5s	86.5	 Pure joy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=87.5s	87.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=88.4s	88.4	 But this was a few seconds before Peter smashed all the pieces off the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=93.2s	93.2	 And, uh, what he flipped the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=96.0s	96.0	 He always does that when he loses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=97.4s	97.4	 And, uh, his motto is when you call him a sore loser, he says, show me a good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=101.3s	101.3	 loser and I'll show you a loser.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=105.4s	105.4	 But I just want to also comment on the pleats on sax's pants and how high that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=110.6s	110.6	 waist and the cell phone holster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=117.0s	117.0	 Is that a black?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=117.6s	117.6	 Sure.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=124.2s	124.2	 It keeps on giving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=125.0s	125.0	 I do have to say rule of hair game.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=174.8s	174.8	 However, one thing that we've had a hard time figuring out is the state of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=180.7s	180.7	 supply chain and it's confounding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=184.7s	184.7	 It seems like nobody knows what the hell they're doing, but there's one guy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=238.0s	238.0	 We'll probably listen to it together tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=239.4s	239.4	 Whenever it comes out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=240.3s	240.3	 Ryan, what is the state now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=241.9s	241.9	 Should we be worried about the supply chain?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=244.2s	244.2	 Is it getting better?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=245.1s	245.1	 Is it getting worse?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=245.8s	245.8	 What's 2022 going to look like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=247.2s	247.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=247.6s	247.6	 I mean, I think the supply chain means a lot of things and it'll depend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=250.2s	250.2	 on what your industry is, what's really happening, but you know, it goes for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=253.9s	253.9	 everything from manufacturing products, which means sourcing all the sub
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=257.2s	257.2	 components like semiconductors through logistics and final delivery all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=262.0s	262.0	 way to a customer store and where Flexport focuses on is sort of picking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=265.9s	265.9	 goods up from factories around the world and delivering them into fulfillment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=269.7s	269.7	 centers all over the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=270.6s	270.6	 So kind of that global mile is what we sometimes call it there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=274.5s	274.5	 You're seeing real disruption.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=276.5s	276.5	 And it starts really with the pandemic shift in consumer behavior where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=280.8s	280.8	 people started buying more goods because they couldn't go to restaurants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=284.0s	284.0	 and travel and things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=284.9s	284.9	 And so a lot of spend shifted onto goods and imports are up almost 20%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=290.0s	290.0	 imported container volumes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=292.0s	292.0	 So that's the start of it all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=293.5s	293.5	 And then what we learned is our infrastructure is dilapidated and unable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=297.8s	297.8	 to handle a 20% increase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=299.6s	299.6	 And by infrastructure, I mean the number of ships in the world, the capacity of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=304.4s	304.4	 throughput of the ports, the number of trucks and availability of trucks and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=309.6s	309.6	 chassis, which is the trailers that haul containers around, we just didn't have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=313.5s	313.5	 enough of these things or the port capacity, you know, like look at American
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=317.4s	317.4	 ports operate this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=318.4s	318.4	 I just learned the statistic pretty recently and I keep saying it because it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=320.7s	320.7	 appalls me our ports operate with a lower throughput and productivity level
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=325.2s	325.2	 than Mombasa, Kenya.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=327.5s	327.5	 And you know, we just do not have modern port infrastructure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=330.9s	330.9	 Rotterdam has been fully automated for 20 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=333.7s	333.7	 So if they want to run 24 seven and keep containers flowing through the port, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=338.0s	338.0	 can do that with self-driving trucks and everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=340.5s	340.5	 Is that a technology issue or do you think that's a regulatory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=343.2s	343.2	 capture and union issue?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=344.8s	344.8	 Like a labor issue, like a labor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=346.5s	346.5	 The tech is there, you know, it's existed for a long, long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=349.0s	349.0	 It's really about labor getting together with management, negotiating these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=352.6s	352.6	 things and allowing it to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=355.1s	355.1	 And the way that our ports are run is it's pretty crazy when you look at it, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=359.0s	359.0	 treat labor as a fungible commodity is in the port terminal operators will say, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=365.0s	365.0	 need this many workers tomorrow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=367.0s	367.0	 And the union provisions that many workers, but there's different people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=369.7s	369.7	 every day doing operating complex, you know, heavy machinery that you can't, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=377.0s	377.0	 the number one thing in business is like, what did we learn today and how are we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=380.7s	380.7	 going to do better tomorrow every day with your team?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=383.8s	383.8	 But if it's a new team every day, like that's not even possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=386.3s	386.3	 So I don't know how you can drive a productivity improvement when it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=389.0s	389.0	 different workers every single day of the week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=391.0s	391.0	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=391.4s	391.4	 So wait, they're not full-time employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=393.1s	393.1	 They're like staff by the hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=395.0s	395.0	 They're union workers are paid by, they have annual contracts, but they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=398.4s	398.4	 union decide who goes to work every day and who gets shifts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=401.4s	401.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=401.6s	401.6	 And where, and so they'll show up at different terminals and there's like 15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=404.7s	404.7	 different terminals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=405.3s	405.3	 So they just kind of move around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=406.2s	406.2	 Do different jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=406.8s	406.8	 It's essentially what we saw it on the waterfront where like the union decides you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=411.5s	411.5	 get to work today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=412.2s	412.2	 These other people didn't whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=413.4s	413.4	 It's like literally like that movie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=415.0s	415.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=415.3s	415.3	 It's literally like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=416.5s	416.5	 Even going further back in supply chains to manufacturing centers, how much are you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=422.3s	422.3	 hearing about and seeing kind of labor shortages because people are out for COVID
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=426.8s	426.8	 and Hey, someone's sick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=428.1s	428.1	 They got to take 10 days off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=429.3s	429.3	 And when, you know, 10% of the employees get sick and they lose 10 days of work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=433.6s	433.6	 the facility sees a decline in productivity to 70, 80% of normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=438.0s	438.0	 And then, you know, all of the output of that facility goes way down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=441.4s	441.4	 I mean, are you hearing about more of that stuff happening particularly during this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=445.3s	445.3	 kind of Omicron wave where the real effect of that hasn't really hit the supply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=450.2s	450.2	 chain system yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=451.1s	451.1	 And we're still kind of seeing a buildup of, you know, of demand and we don't, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=457.3s	457.3	 know, we haven't really kind of hit the problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=460.1s	460.1	 So for the last 18 months, China had this total zero tolerance policy and was very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=465.6s	465.6	 successful in keeping COVID out of out of their country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=468.6s	468.6	 And so manufacturing just kept running as if not no problem in China, which is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=473.0s	473.0	 majority of this manufacturing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=475.8s	475.8	 With Omicron, you're starting to see that it is still taking hold and zero
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=479.4s	479.4	 tolerance policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=480.1s	480.1	 We haven't yet seen like major shutdowns and waves of shutdowns, but a little bit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=485.2s	485.2	 you're seeing that here and there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=487.0s	487.0	 The zero tolerance policy has shown up, for example, at least twice where one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=492.4s	492.4	 launch, one port worker in a Chinese port got COVID and they shut the whole port
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=497.0s	497.0	 down for like three weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=498.0s	498.0	 Yeah, that's crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=498.8s	498.8	 It's really extreme.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=500.0s	500.0	 I mean, U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=500.6s	500.6	 workers have been getting COVID nonstop and the ports keep operating even at, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=504.5s	504.5	 know, we have lower level of productivity, but they'll shut the whole port down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=507.4s	507.4	 That happened both at Yan Tian, which is the largest port in China or second
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=510.3s	510.3	 largest and Ningbo, which is the third largest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=512.6s	512.6	 So it's been very, very disruptive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=515.2s	515.2	 It's also happened at the airports over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=517.5s	517.5	 So that's something I'll definitely keep an eye on here over the next couple of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=520.5s	520.5	 months or even next couple of weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=522.6s	522.6	 Are we still having this like we're ordering too many goods and we're backed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=526.8s	526.8	 up or is it that we're backed up for six months, just trying to fulfill all those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=530.8s	530.8	 pandemic orders?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=532.3s	532.3	 Like what's the state of the backlog today, if you could describe it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=535.6s	535.6	 So volumes are high, but they're sort of flat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=537.9s	537.9	 They're over year over year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=539.1s	539.1	 They're flat now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=539.9s	539.9	 They're much higher than pre pandemic, but they're pretty much flat year over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=542.8s	542.8	 year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=543.5s	543.5	 And that's what has me so worried here is that you have increasing delays, even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=548.1s	548.1	 though the inputs the same and we have a complex system where the same amount of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=551.5s	551.5	 inputs coming in, but the delays getting longer and longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=554.5s	554.5	 That's a very worrisome sign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=555.6s	555.6	 Like if you're ever building a technology system, you're building this system and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=560.8s	560.8	 you're sending the same amount of bits in and the performing the job is taking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=565.0s	565.0	 longer and longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=566.2s	566.2	 That should be like, that would be a very alarming sign that you're going to want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=569.4s	569.4	 to send some of your best engineers in here to debug this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=571.6s	571.6	 But I think we're seeing that like, cause a lot of companies, people don't realize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=574.8s	574.8	 like when they buy capital equipment, like machines that, you know, are either
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=578.8s	578.8	 sold to end users or machines that are used in their own production systems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=582.8s	582.8	 Capital equipment is typically assembled last minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=585.2s	585.2	 It's not like, you know, there are companies that own huge pieces of equipment and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=588.6s	588.6	 then they ship them and they just get plugged in and turned on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=590.6s	590.6	 There's usually components associated with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=592.8s	592.8	 And you know, in businesses I've been involved in over the last couple of years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=595.8s	595.8	 we've got a lot of lab businesses and hardware businesses and just getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=599.2s	599.2	 capital equipment has been like delays like we've never seen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=602.6s	602.6	 It's like, you know, a year to a year and a half or something that used to take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=605.0s	605.0	 four to six weeks to arrive because the company that makes that equipment is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=608.7s	608.7	 having delays with each of their component suppliers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=611.4s	611.4	 And then all of this stuff backs up into the system and it plays out where the end
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=614.4s	614.4	 user is now stuck waiting a year, year and a half and the business doesn't make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=617.5s	617.5	 progress. And a lot of hardware companies in Silicon Valley right now are facing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=621.1s	621.1	 these significant shortages where they can't get the equipment they need to ship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=625.1s	625.1	 product to their customers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=626.8s	626.8	 And they're sitting around burning money every month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=629.0s	629.0	 And so the result will actually show up down the road when all of a sudden they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=633.7s	633.7	 miss revenue three, four quarters down the road.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=636.6s	636.6	 And that's why I've been saying for a couple of shows now that the biggest thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=640.6s	640.6	 I'm concerned about is when the revenue shortfalls start to hit the companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=644.3s	644.3	 that are dependent on these supply chains, but you don't actually see their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=647.1s	647.1	 revenue shortfall for a couple of quarters after the supply chain problems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=650.7s	650.7	 hit them. And just this quarter with the quarterly earnings, we're now seeing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=654.2s	654.2	 that the company yesterday that reported called ingredient, their big food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=658.3s	658.3	 ingredients company, and they just reported how supply chain problems have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=662.0s	662.0	 now backed up to effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=663.3s	663.3	 And the stock was down like 10, 11 percent yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=665.8s	665.8	 And this is like a very stable, very mature third largest producer of starch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=671.3s	671.3	 in the United States and their business got totally hammered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=674.0s	674.0	 But it took a while before that hit them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=676.6s	676.6	 And so, you know, it feels to me, Ryan, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=680.4s	680.4	 a lot of the business level and market level risk isn't going to show up for a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=684.6s	684.6	 while after these supply chain problems really persist within their organization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=689.1s	689.1	 This is the thing that has me most concerned is what's happened is it's now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=693.1s	693.1	 taking a hundred and fifteen days on average across our customer base
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=698.8s	698.8	 from when the factory says, hey, these goods are ready, come pick them up to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=703.4s	703.4	 when they finally get delivered to a warehouse in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=706.0s	706.0	 Crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=706.4s	706.4	 One hundred fifteen days before the pandemic, that was 50 and 50 even felt high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=711.0s	711.0	 Like the ship is only taking 15 days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=712.8s	712.8	 Like what the heck is going on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=714.0s	714.0	 A lot of inefficiency, a lot of customs processing, hard to find a truck, etc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=718.4s	718.4	 Even in normal times, when you go to one hundred and fifteen, all of a sudden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=722.4s	722.4	 these companies are so much less agile, like because you've placed the orders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=727.2s	727.2	 and you're expecting forecasting demand is so hard and now you're forecasting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=730.9s	730.9	 demand for twice as long of a time period.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=733.2s	733.2	 You've already placed all that inventory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=734.7s	734.7	 If your demand goes down, guess what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=735.9s	735.9	 You've already ordered the goods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=737.4s	737.4	 So I'm really worried that we're going to find out in six months or in some time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=741.2s	741.2	 period in the future here that people have ordered way too many goods, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=744.7s	744.7	 these companies expected demand to stay high and keep booming at some point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=749.0s	749.0	 Consumers start going to restaurants and start traveling a lot more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=752.4s	752.4	 You get pre COVID consumption patterns and all these companies get stuck with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=757.1s	757.1	 way too much inventory that they paid way too much to ship and get delivered
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=760.8s	760.8	 and they can't sell it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=761.7s	761.7	 And so I'd be very worried for like middle market kind of retail,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=766.1s	766.1	 direct to consumer ecom, these types of businesses that aren't very sophisticated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=770.0s	770.0	 in demand planning and end up with way too much inventory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=772.7s	772.7	 I think that there's been this weird dispersion actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=775.5s	775.5	 And I think that like the supply chain issues are not broadly distributed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=779.9s	779.9	 So if you bear with me for a second, if you watch the earnings reports, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=783.9s	783.9	 know how closely you watch them Ryan this past couple of weeks, but like Apple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=787.9s	787.9	 and Tesla basically said, ah, it's kind of reasonably well managed, particularly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=792.7s	792.7	 on the chip side and we see the whole thing easing Q4, Q1 of next year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=796.8s	796.8	 Amazon last night basically said, yeah, there's some, you know, toughness in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=800.6s	800.6	 system, but we think it's sort of like, you know, reasonably achievable and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=805.3s	805.3	 they're past it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=806.5s	806.5	 And so it seems like the bigger companies who have influence were able to manage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=810.5s	810.5	 through it, these smaller companies to your point, who really do rely on many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=816.3s	816.3	 actors in the supply chain have been really thrown left and right that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=820.0s	820.0	 probably don't know where demand really is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=821.9s	821.9	 So is that sort of the more nuanced actual, the way that it's running out?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=825.7s	825.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=826.4s	826.4	 And it's sort of, it's very interesting to see this flip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=829.4s	829.4	 So pre-pandemic, the biggest companies paid the least for freight because they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=832.6s	832.6	 buy the most freight, so they negotiate good rates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=835.4s	835.4	 Now they're paying the most and the biggest companies for a reason, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=838.8s	838.8	 have the best businesses, they either have the best margins, the best, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=841.9s	841.9	 know, they just built something that people want it scaled to be huge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=845.0s	845.0	 Well, when times are tough and you need to spend extra to prioritize your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=849.6s	849.6	 freight, to get loaded, to sign a contract and make sure that these ship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=854.9s	854.9	 owners and airlines honor their commitments and serve up, step up, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=859.3s	859.3	 the big companies that can afford it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=860.8s	860.8	 And so they're not paying extra for freight, but they're getting around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=863.7s	863.7	 these problems and freight is a really interesting market because it's pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=868.3s	868.3	 inelastic, like you either going to ship the thing or you're not the, whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=872.2s	872.2	 the price is, you probably still shipping it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=874.3s	874.3	 And so like you, I haven't ever looked at an Apple at this level, but I'm sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=878.6s	878.6	 that if you did, you'd see that it's a, the percent they spend on freight is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=882.2s	882.2	 just negligible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=883.2s	883.2	 So if they doubled it, it wouldn't matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=884.9s	884.9	 But to Chamath's point, it seems like, and I think we're seeing this a lot, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=888.2s	888.2	 bigger companies can actually afford to integrate their supply chains.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=891.2s	891.2	 Whereas before it didn't make sense to vertically integrate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=893.7s	893.7	 Like I think Walmart announced that they've spent like 11 or $12 billion kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=897.2s	897.2	 of rebuilding their supply chain themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=899.7s	899.7	 Apple obviously has captive facilities all the way down to the fab where they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=903.8s	903.8	 driving the whole supply chain from fab to components, all these Foxconn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=907.7s	907.7	 facilities that are operated for them are captive facilities, but the Tesla
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=911.7s	911.7	 obviously, you know, has a very deeply integrated supply chain team.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=914.9s	914.9	 Whereas GM probably relied on subs who relied on subs who relied on subs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=918.7s	918.7	 And that's why GM delivered like no electric cars, but Tesla was able to keep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=922.6s	922.6	 volume up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=923.6s	923.6	 The guys that are winning are the ones that are integrating supply chains.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=927.4s	927.4	 And do you think that that kind of becomes a persistent solution here where, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=931.0s	931.0	 know, bigger companies, their competitive advantage becomes, Hey, we're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=933.5s	933.5	 own our whole supply chain all the way through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=935.6s	935.6	 We're going to own more of the infrastructure all the way through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=937.9s	937.9	 Like Amazon's done with delivery vans and ultimately be able to kind of, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=941.6s	941.6	 know, have a true competitive advantage because of this disruption that's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=944.7s	944.7	 on right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=946.0s	946.0	 Yeah, potentially.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=946.7s	946.7	 I mean, I think, Oh, my vision for Flexport is that we become that layer and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=950.1s	950.1	 we allow small businesses, medium sized businesses to get access to world class
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=954.0s	954.0	 logistics services and get them, you know, sort of almost be a union that can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=957.0s	957.0	 represent them at the table is against these bigger guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=961.0s	961.0	 I think it's very interesting to see a company's like the biggest companies have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=965.1s	965.1	 gone out and chartered their own ships.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=966.8s	966.8	 Totally wild experiment to watch for my, my, I was sitting here with popcorn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=970.8s	970.8	 You're bringing up a really important effect of all of this, which is what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=974.6s	974.6	 happens now in six or nine months to your point, when the consumption of hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=979.0s	979.0	 physical assets turns towards the consumption of services, which it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=982.2s	982.2	 typically does, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=983.8s	983.8	 If you revert back to the mean here, you know, people aren't going to be buying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=987.5s	987.5	 as many Pelotons and all of that stuff because they bought them all right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=990.7s	990.7	 They bought all the physical goods they need.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=993.1s	993.1	 And to your point, these companies have over ordered all this inventory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=997.0s	997.0	 Actually Peloton is a perfect example because they basically shut down their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1000.2s	1000.2	 entire supply chain last at the end of this past quarter and essentially said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1003.5s	1003.5	 our inventory turns will be more than enough to meet, you know, existing demand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1007.6s	1007.6	 for the foreseeable future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1009.4s	1009.4	 That's an enormous capital problem that these companies now all of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1012.8s	1012.8	 sudden will face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1013.6s	1013.6	 Right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1013.9s	1013.9	 So like the next step beyond all of the supply chain issues could be, and I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1018.6s	1018.6	 Sachs has been talking about this a lot, like a, a pretty bad recession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1021.6s	1021.6	 If these companies have all this inventory and they don't know how to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1024.2s	1024.2	 working capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1025.9s	1025.9	 Yeah, it can be real ugly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1027.0s	1027.0	 And the other factor is the price has gone crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1029.3s	1029.3	 So the price of shipping and container long run, like I've been in this business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1033.9s	1033.9	 and been a customer of this business for 20 years and you're, you can just rule
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1036.8s	1036.8	 of thumb, it costs you 2000 bucks to ship a container from China to the West coast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1041.4s	1041.4	 During 2016, that price collapsed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1045.1s	1045.1	 So you have these booming bus cycles of an asset market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1047.9s	1047.9	 2016, it was 550 bucks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1050.8s	1050.8	 Last year was $20,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1052.7s	1052.7	 So it's up 10 X over normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1055.4s	1055.4	 It's up 40 X over or more right over just a few years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1060.5s	1060.5	 And what, what that's done is create a real barrier to entry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1064.1s	1064.1	 Like for a DDC e-comm business, you used to be able to just go to China, find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1068.3s	1068.3	 some product, put your slap, your label on it and go sell it on Amazon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1071.3s	1071.3	 And you were in business and it was like a huge number of people doing this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1075.6s	1075.6	 Right now you have to come up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1077.0s	1077.0	 If you want to ship 10 containers, it used to be, you needed 20 grand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1080.2s	1080.2	 Now you need 200 grand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1081.2s	1081.2	 That's like, that's a real barrier to entry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1084.0s	1084.0	 So actually I've talked to some companies in this space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1087.1s	1087.1	 We're really happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1088.0s	1088.0	 Like if you have an established business, you're like, great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1090.3s	1090.3	 Now it's much harder for Joe Schmo to show up in China and start competing with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1094.6s	1094.6	 So I was really surprised to hear that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1096.4s	1096.4	 I thought that was a pretty sophisticated take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1098.7s	1098.7	 At what dollar point does air freight compete with containers?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1103.6s	1103.6	 Cause when we start hearing about chips, I was always wondering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1106.1s	1106.1	 And again, I'm no expert, but putting a bunch of chips on a plane versus putting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1110.6s	1110.6	 them in a container, given how much those chips are valued by a Tesla, whoever's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1115.5s	1115.5	 putting them into, you know, a car, um, isn't what was the breaking point?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1120.6s	1120.6	 Certainly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1120.8s	1120.8	 But air freight prices just gone in line and it's gone up five X as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1124.1s	1124.1	 And one thing to remember is that 50% of all the world's air freight flies in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1127.8s	1127.8	 belly of passenger planes, which should kind of horrify you if you're ever flying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1131.9s	1131.9	 on a passenger plane from, from East Asia, but to the United States, there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1134.8s	1134.8	 probably a whole bunch of stuff down in that belly and those are grounded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1138.4s	1138.4	 So the supply of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1140.1s	1140.1	 Why are they grounded?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1141.9s	1141.9	 Nobody's flying to China right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1143.4s	1143.4	 Oh, I see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1144.0s	1144.0	 So because there's no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1145.6s	1145.6	 Now we're seeing kind of the backlog play into commodity cycles, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1148.5s	1148.5	 Ryan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1148.8s	1148.8	 So we're seeing like a lot of these commodities because of these, uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1152.3s	1152.3	 discontinuities in these supply chains.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1154.9s	1154.9	 Uh, suddenly commodity prices are spiking all over the place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1157.8s	1157.8	 And I mean, do we think that that settles down or do you think it kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1160.5s	1160.5	 continues for, you know, the foreseeable future until this all works its way out?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1165.2s	1165.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1165.5s	1165.5	 I mean, I'm not the right person to ask about commodity prices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1167.8s	1167.8	 Maybe Chamath has a view on that, but I, I, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1170.4s	1170.4	 on the logistics market, I don't see it sorting itself out for the next year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1173.7s	1173.7	 Uh, the next couple of years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1175.2s	1175.2	 In fact, you've, you've warned that it might get worse, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1177.6s	1177.6	 You've, I mean, I saw on Bloomberg, you said that there could be a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1179.9s	1179.9	 union strike in maybe October.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1182.3s	1182.3	 What are the prospects for that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1183.9s	1183.9	 And what happens if, if that takes place?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1186.2s	1186.2	 Um, so it's on July 1st of the year, the West coast union, it's called the ILWU.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1192.2s	1192.2	 There, that union extends from the Southern border.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1194.5s	1194.5	 So from Mexico all the way to Alaska and it includes Canada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1198.5s	1198.5	 So the whole West coast of the United States is run by this one union at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1201.6s	1201.6	 ports and they, uh, their contract expires on July 1st and, uh, in years past.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1207.6s	1207.6	 So the last time this happened was in 2015.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1209.6s	1209.6	 This is a contract that was signed then and extended at some point, but, um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1213.5s	1213.5	 in 2015, they had a three month period where nobody could import anything on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1217.1s	1217.1	 West coast, uh, and some major companies missed Christmas that year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1221.1s	1221.1	 So, uh, that's July 1st.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1223.2s	1223.2	 Uh, typically these, there's kind of slowdowns in the months leading up to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1227.1s	1227.1	 that and we've already had slowdowns for a couple of years with hundreds of ships
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1231.5s	1231.5	 are now waiting offshore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1233.2s	1233.2	 So yeah, I can't make a prediction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1235.8s	1235.8	 This is slowdown, basically a negotiating tactic by the unions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1239.0s	1239.0	 In the past it has been, I'm not convinced that that's what we've seen over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1241.6s	1241.6	 the last year versus, you know, they are, there are legitimate problems,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1244.9s	1244.9	 staffing, people getting COVID, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1247.4s	1247.4	 So is there a role for presidential leadership in sorting out these union
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1251.9s	1251.9	 issues or just sorting out the issues with the port more generally or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1255.1s	1255.1	 avoiding a strike in July?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1258.0s	1258.0	 I mean, it seems to me that if Biden wants to get reelected, this inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1262.7s	1262.7	 supply chain issues are pretty top of mind and in the news and are going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1267.3s	1267.3	 on people's, you know, you want to be seen doing things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1269.7s	1269.7	 And I do think there are things that can be done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1271.1s	1271.1	 So yeah, there's a role.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1273.8s	1273.8	 And as far as union negotiations, Biden's probably pretty as equipped as any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1278.7s	1278.7	 president's ever been to negotiate with the union and get them to play nice and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1282.8s	1282.8	 not screw up his reelection with a, with a strike.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1285.9s	1285.9	 He's known as a union friendly president and go sit down and do a deal with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1289.5s	1289.5	 where Trump would probably never be able to do a deal with the union because they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1292.8s	1292.8	 know that they're sort of natural adversaries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1294.7s	1294.7	 So there's something there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1297.7s	1297.7	 There's a lot more to be done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1298.9s	1298.9	 And, and I, you know, I got some arguments with people that are like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1301.6s	1301.6	 that's not in the president's power to do such and such.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1303.9s	1303.9	 I'm like, yeah, but he's the president of the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1306.2s	1306.2	 You pick up the phone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1306.8s	1306.8	 Like you can do things that aren't legally in your power just by asking for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1309.4s	1309.4	 favors and other people do them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1312.5s	1312.5	 And negotiating with unions is a good idea, a good example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1315.8s	1315.8	 Convincing to change the zoning laws in LA so you can stack containers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1320.3s	1320.3	 higher would be another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1321.3s	1321.3	 Yeah, that's not the president of the United States jurisdiction, but if he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1324.4s	1324.4	 calls the mayor of LA or the city council, can you explain that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1327.5s	1327.5	 So what, what does that mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1328.5s	1328.5	 So in Southern California, you can't stack a container more than too high in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1333.2s	1333.2	 a truck yard by law, well, we got no place to put these containers, but it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1338.2s	1338.2	 not, is that a danger issue or is that like a site issue, sightlines?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1341.7s	1341.7	 Like what, what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1342.5s	1342.5	 I assume a little bit of us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1343.5s	1343.5	 I think there's some safety issues, although they're stacked six high all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1346.0s	1346.0	 over the world, so that's not that legitimate to my, in my view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1349.3s	1349.3	 Um, and in California it's what four or something too, too high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1353.8s	1353.8	 It's too hot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1354.6s	1354.6	 Oh wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1355.3s	1355.3	 At the truck yards at the port, you see them stacked up six high, but in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1358.1s	1358.1	 truck yards too is the limit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1360.0s	1360.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1360.5s	1360.5	 And so it's, it's a, it's also an eyesore, especially in California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1365.0s	1365.0	 Um, containers are a sign of free enterprise and it's just the people in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1368.9s	1368.9	 California can't stand to see them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1370.8s	1370.8	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1371.3s	1371.3	 They really just object to the idea of capitalism in their neighborhoods like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1377.2s	1377.2	 But there could be like some kind of temporary waiver that we do just to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1380.3s	1380.3	 through all of this backlog, which is to say, okay, let's just ease all of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1384.4s	1384.4	 small little things that slow the process down just to get all these ships, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1389.2s	1389.2	 know, unloaded, right off into the world where they need to be, and then we could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1394.1s	1394.1	 revert back to what we are after things, you know, kind of normalize.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1397.8s	1397.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1398.1s	1398.1	 So we did that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1398.7s	1398.7	 So like I wrote about this, this zoning law and what's happening then is if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1403.7s	1403.7	 can't stack the container three high, there's nowhere to put that third container.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1408.1s	1408.1	 So you leave it on the trailer and now you have one less trailer in rotation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1412.1s	1412.1	 serving the port to unload.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1413.7s	1413.7	 And that's, that's true across Southern California right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1415.7s	1415.7	 There are thousands of trailers with containers on them because they're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1418.4s	1418.4	 allowed to stack them, they'll get fined if they do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1420.4s	1420.4	 So I tweeted about this and the, the city of Long Beach actually responded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1424.8s	1424.8	 I tweeted about it at 6 a.m.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1426.7s	1426.7	 by 3 p.m.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1427.6s	1427.6	 the city of Long Beach had changed the zoning law to allow stacking up to five
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1431.3s	1431.3	 high, I believe I'm told the fastest response by any government to citizen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1435.3s	1435.3	 action, like ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1436.8s	1436.8	 That's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1437.5s	1437.5	 You must feel great about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1438.7s	1438.7	 It was great, but unfortunately only Long Beach did that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1440.6s	1440.6	 LA never followed through other, and there's not that many truck yards in Long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1444.2s	1444.2	 Beach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1444.4s	1444.4	 A lot of them are in Los Angeles, Compton, Rancho de Minguez, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1447.3s	1447.3	 So I saw, this is the kind of thing like, yeah, Joe Biden could call these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1450.6s	1450.6	 mayors and say, Hey, let's work on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1452.2s	1452.2	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1452.4s	1452.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1452.6s	1452.6	 But let's face it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1453.3s	1453.3	 He's super union Joe, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1455.9s	1455.9	 Like, I mean, he wouldn't even say the word Tesla over the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1457.9s	1457.9	 No, but Jason, isn't that more pro union?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1459.8s	1459.8	 Because won't these folks be working more and getting paid more?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1462.9s	1462.9	 And I don't think there's a reluctance to pay, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1465.9s	1465.9	 Because clearly like you're going to have to put some money into the system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1469.0s	1469.0	 and where the money comes from, we can figure that out later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1471.2s	1471.2	 But the point is that there's a, there should be a desire to actually get the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1474.5s	1474.5	 people on the ground to be working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1476.2s	1476.2	 There wasn't even a third shift, shift Ryan, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1478.4s	1478.4	 Like that was another thing you were working on, on top of the stacking of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1482.0s	1482.0	 these containers to get, you know, more of these, you know, to alleviate the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1486.4s	1486.4	 problem you were also talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1487.5s	1487.5	 They don't even have a third shift some nights, but they seem to have added a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1490.5s	1490.5	 third shift, did that become permanent or not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1492.8s	1492.8	 No, they do have a third shift, but nobody's showing up is the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1496.0s	1496.0	 So if truck drivers don't work in the middle of the night, warehouses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1498.4s	1498.4	 aren't open in the middle of the night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1499.6s	1499.6	 But is that a compensation issue, Ryan?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1501.2s	1501.2	 Like if we paid more, would folks show up?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1502.8s	1502.8	 Like, is that just a supply demand issue that needs to get sorted out?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1505.2s	1505.2	 Never underestimate incentives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1506.7s	1506.7	 Um, I, there's, there's just a lot of factors in a lot of, a lot of it is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1511.5s	1511.5	 it's so easy to point fingers at somebody else and blame someone in the chain,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1514.5s	1514.5	 right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1514.7s	1514.7	 Supply chain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1515.4s	1515.4	 You've got all these different people and it's everybody has their own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1518.7s	1518.7	 opinion, you know, we, at one point I wanted to hear what the union's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1521.6s	1521.6	 opinion was, what, what are they saying?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1523.4s	1523.4	 Because everyone else is calling them lazy and not working hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1526.4s	1526.4	 What's really happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1527.2s	1527.2	 So we, I said to taco truck down to the port a couple of months ago, just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1532.5s	1532.5	 to, because we, I figured we get them free tacos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1534.8s	1534.8	 They'll talk to us and that was a game changer right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1537.3s	1537.3	 Yeah, that really works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1538.4s	1538.4	 So we, we, well, we got, um, they, they loved it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1541.0s	1541.0	 These were the only business ever to send tacos to the port.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1543.7s	1543.7	 And then they told us all about what their viewpoint was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1547.5s	1547.5	 They viewed that the truckers are screwed up that 50% of all the appointments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1552.4s	1552.4	 where a truck is supposed to come and pick up a container, they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1554.5s	1554.5	 missing their appointments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1556.1s	1556.1	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1556.6s	1556.6	 Um, and because, and then, and then, so that's what sent me investigating,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1559.7s	1559.7	 wait, why are they missing the appointments?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1560.8s	1560.8	 That's when I learned, oh, they don't have any trailers, these chassis,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1564.3s	1564.3	 because they're stuck under containers and can't be unlocked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1567.6s	1567.6	 So a lot of it is going here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1569.0s	1569.0	 It's the supply chain is kind of like this, that metaphorical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1572.1s	1572.1	 elephant in the dark room, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1573.6s	1573.6	 And everybody sees their own aspect of it, but you got to synthesize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1577.5s	1577.5	 all those perspectives and kind of take a systems view and see if you can get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1580.9s	1580.9	 some real understanding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1581.9s	1581.9	 I'm not convinced I have it yet, by the way, I think it is more complex
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1585.2s	1585.2	 and I'm really beware simple narratives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1587.5s	1587.5	 If someone, even including me says, oh, this is exactly what's happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1590.6s	1590.6	 Like there's really a lot of complexity in all of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1593.7s	1593.7	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1594.0s	1594.0	 And how much, how much of this is sort of the, the, the extreme end
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1598.4s	1598.4	 of the other spectrum, which is basically the U S exceptionalism view that says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1602.0s	1602.0	 okay, we just need to really in-house more of the stuff that we need so that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1606.2s	1606.2	 we don't actually have to rely on some of these arcane methods of just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1610.1s	1610.1	 transporting goods for, you know, from point A to point B.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1612.6s	1612.6	 In my view, that would be a shame if we, I mean, we have the best companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1616.0s	1616.0	 in the world who need to be able to source raw materials, components, finished
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1621.2s	1621.2	 goods anywhere on planet earth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1623.4s	1623.4	 And we should have a modern infrastructure that makes that possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1626.2s	1626.2	 Instead of being like, oh, we can't trade with the rest of the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1628.8s	1628.8	 So we're going to become like self-sufficient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1631.6s	1631.6	 You know, we might as well go back to everybody being a farmer on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1634.0s	1634.0	 subsistence farmer on our own land.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1635.6s	1635.6	 Like, I think we should have global infrastructure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1638.2s	1638.2	 That's really great and seamless and makes it really easy, but you're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1641.8s	1641.8	 That might be an end result is people can't rely on these supply chains and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1645.3s	1645.3	 start saying, Hey, let's manufacture at home or let's manufacture in Latin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1647.8s	1647.8	 America, let's manufacture closer to home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1650.7s	1650.7	 That to my perspective, that would be a shame.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1652.7s	1652.7	 Well, I think the, I think the prod, the pendulum always starts from one extreme
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1656.9s	1656.9	 to the other, and I think the, the middle ground is probably that you need to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1660.5s	1660.5	 some heterogeneity, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1661.9s	1661.9	 You have to have some amount of it that is not just singularly reliant on China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1666.4s	1666.4	 Maybe it's, maybe it's to central or Latin America, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1669.5s	1669.5	 Some that's domestic, but that domestic production probably has to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1672.8s	1672.8	 subsidized by something because we're never going to be able to run as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1676.0s	1676.0	 efficiently and as cost-effectively as, you know, cheaper international labor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1681.2s	1681.2	 You know, unless we invent something really, you know, incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1685.2s	1685.2	 So the balance is probably in the middle, but it's going to take us a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1688.9s	1688.9	 long time to kind of get there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1689.9s	1689.9	 I think I saw a governor Abbott was pitching people on, Hey, just send
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1693.5s	1693.5	 your containers to Texas where cheaper and more central in the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1698.2s	1698.2	 Is that true?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1699.1s	1699.1	 Is that a solution?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1700.3s	1700.3	 It takes much longer, costs much more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1703.3s	1703.3	 When, if the union goes on strike on the West coast, it'll be one of your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1705.7s	1705.7	 only options, bringing stuff through the canal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1708.4s	1708.4	 What you'll very quickly see is that the canal is going to back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1711.8s	1711.8	 Can't move that many more ships through the canal that are currently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1714.5s	1714.5	 going to the West coast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1715.3s	1715.3	 So a lot, and you've seen that a lot where the bottleneck just moves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1720.1s	1720.1	 For a while last summer, the, for example, the trains that were going into Chicago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1726.4s	1726.4	 they were really having a hard time staffing the railroads out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1729.5s	1729.5	 And it was taking them a long time to unload containers at the, at the port,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1733.4s	1733.4	 at the terminals inland in Chicago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1735.8s	1735.8	 And drivers, a lot of the truck drivers are owner operators.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1739.2s	1739.2	 So these are entrepreneurs who own their own truck work for themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1743.1s	1743.1	 And they were able pre pandemic to do three loads per day at these Chicago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1748.0s	1748.0	 railheads, go drop it off, come back, get another one three times with the delays
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1752.7s	1752.7	 and the traffic jams that resulted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1754.5s	1754.5	 They were only able to do one a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1757.2s	1757.2	 And so you opt out because you can go drive for UPS or FedEx or take your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1760.7s	1760.7	 truck and do something else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1761.8s	1761.8	 So we had this huge reduction in drivers and that's the kind of a feedback loop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1766.6s	1766.6	 that we should all be really mindful of here where a problem begets more problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1771.3s	1771.3	 And you get these positive feedback loops in the system that really vicious cycles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1776.4s	1776.4	 And so, you know, bottlenecks move and you'll see as soon as they, if everybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1780.4s	1780.4	 started to ship to Houston, guess what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1781.6s	1781.6	 Houston port won't be able to handle the volumes either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1784.2s	1784.2	 It's not like it's magically better just cause it's a Republican state or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1788.1s	1788.1	 Do we need more ports or do we just need to run them more efficiently?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1791.8s	1791.8	 And then who determines who runs the port?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1795.9s	1795.9	 Cause I know that they, I've seen some tweets of yours where they license the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1799.8s	1799.8	 government, I guess, owns the ports, but they license it to people to have the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1803.0s	1803.0	 franchise there more ports, better run ports.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1806.4s	1806.4	 And then what's the business model of ports?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1808.2s	1808.2	 I'd say better run ports is the answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1809.7s	1809.7	 I don't think we need more ports.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1811.3s	1811.3	 You can't really create ports out of thin air.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1813.3s	1813.3	 Like there's only a handful of geographic locations that actually make sense for a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1816.7s	1816.7	 port and we have, we have great geography, like the San Francisco Bay, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1821.5s	1821.5	 this is probably the best natural Harbor in the world or one of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1825.4s	1825.4	 And the Oakland ports perfectly fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1827.3s	1827.3	 It's who owns it is the city of Oakland or the city of Long Beach, the city of LA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1832.2s	1832.2	 This is the local cities own the ports in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1835.0s	1835.0	 That is a difference between United States and Europe, for example, where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1838.1s	1838.1	 there's sort of national strategic assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1840.4s	1840.4	 They're still government owned, but it can be operated as a sort of public good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1844.9s	1844.9	 for everybody instead of what are the odds given what's going on in Oakland,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1849.2s	1849.2	 that that's the big priority of the mayor of Oakland to like run a better port.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1853.1s	1853.1	 Like she's got a lot of other things on her, on her list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1856.2s	1856.2	 And so that's one problem with our system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1858.4s	1858.4	 And then second, they do rent it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1859.8s	1859.8	 So the government owns it and then rents it to a private company that operates it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1864.0s	1864.0	 And then, but those as a condition of renting the port, you must
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1867.1s	1867.1	 agree to hire the ILWU.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1870.0s	1870.0	 You can't run a non-union port in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1872.7s	1872.7	 Should the government buy the federal government, buy the port from Oakland,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1876.2s	1876.2	 from Long Beach, offer them some, you know, trillion dollars or billions of dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1879.9s	1879.9	 and buy it out from them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1881.1s	1881.1	 It's not a terrible idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1882.4s	1882.4	 I mean, as long as you're forcing everyone to use union labor, it's not really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1885.4s	1885.4	 like a private sector endeavors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1887.1s	1887.1	 It's like you can't, especially with the way that the unions run.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1890.0s	1890.0	 So you can't do that much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1892.1s	1892.1	 But like, here's an example where technology could, Flexport already made this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1895.4s	1895.4	 technology, we could 10x the throughput of one of these ports overnight, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1899.0s	1899.0	 today a truck driver shows up looking for a specific container.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1903.0s	1903.0	 He's like, I got this container number.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1904.2s	1904.2	 So they have to make an appointment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1905.8s	1905.8	 At that hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1906.6s	1906.6	 And as I said, they're missing 50% of their appointments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1909.1s	1909.1	 Well, on the back end, inside the port, they got to go find that container in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1912.5s	1912.5	 this, in the needle in the haystack and make sure it's at the front during that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1916.4s	1916.4	 one hour when the guy shows up for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1918.7s	1918.7	 And you could, we already have this tech to make it what we call a free flow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1922.1s	1922.1	 stack where you just have this, the truck pulls up and you give them the first,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1927.0s	1927.0	 the first container off the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1929.4s	1929.4	 And then the mobile app tells them where to take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1931.6s	1931.6	 And he doesn't have to come for a specific container.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1934.0s	1934.0	 And if you did that, you would just be every 30 seconds coming out of here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1936.7s	1936.7	 instead of every 10, 15 minutes, you'd easily 10x the throughput.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1940.4s	1940.4	 And this is, we already have this tech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1942.1s	1942.1	 So, it's a matter of implementation deployment and how do you get around a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1947.0s	1947.0	 lot of people that don't really want to see better running ports.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1950.6s	1950.6	 And it's pretty sad to sit where I sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1953.6s	1953.6	 They don't benefit from better running ports.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1955.6s	1955.6	 Although that's the good point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1957.0s	1957.0	 Although at the back end, they, they suffer from higher prices and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1960.1s	1960.1	 inefficiency and not getting the things they want on time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1962.8s	1962.8	 Well, if you listen to Elon talk about unions and why Tesla is not a union
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1966.9s	1966.9	 shop, it's got nothing to do with wages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1968.8s	1968.8	 You know, he said, we'll pay you the union rate or better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1973.6s	1973.6	 And it's not about mistreatment because he said, listen, if someone mistreats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1977.0s	1977.0	 you, we're going to have a no assholes rule and we'll get rid of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1979.7s	1979.7	 The issue is inflexibility, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1981.8s	1981.8	 He wants to drive continuous process improvement at Tesla.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1985.3s	1985.3	 And he can't do that with a union shop because every change has to be negotiated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1989.5s	1989.5	 And then if there is a worker who's not living up to the performance bar, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1993.4s	1993.4	 can't get rid of them and they can't repurpose workers and have them work a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1996.6s	1996.6	 different line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=1997.7s	1997.7	 So that's why Elon has always resisted being a union shop, not the wages, not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2001.8s	2001.8	 mistreatment, purely inflexibility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2004.2s	2004.2	 And it seems like that's what you're seeing in the ports as well is we can't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2008.6s	2008.6	 drive changes and improvements because everything's so highly contractually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2012.6s	2012.6	 negotiated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2015.0s	2015.0	 That's my editorial comment, Ryan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2016.3s	2016.3	 What do you think about that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2017.1s	2017.1	 I mean, it's, it's kind of, it's worth studying a little history here is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2020.7s	2020.7	 like, you know, we went through the container revolution in the sixties and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2023.5s	2023.5	 seventies and the union agreed to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2025.2s	2025.2	 And they, that dramatically transformed the waterfront.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2028.7s	2028.7	 These guys, like you see the photographs from that era, they would put it on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2032.6s	2032.6	 their back, like burlap sacks full of stuff, like hauling it on and off these,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2037.0s	2037.0	 these ships and the kind of load them by hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2039.4s	2039.4	 It was a real art and it was a massive employment driver.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2042.6s	2042.6	 And by the way, we've still barely recovered from this, like the West side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2045.6s	2045.6	 highway in New York is finally like a nice park, but it sat there for 50 years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2049.8s	2049.8	 like dilapidated piers and ugly ass buildings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2052.5s	2052.5	 And some of those are still there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2053.6s	2053.6	 San Francisco waterfront still mostly like that south of the Bay Bridge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2057.7s	2057.7	 It's still like these old dilapidated buildings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2060.2s	2060.2	 So it's kind of funny to see how long it takes, like that infrastructure to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2063.6s	2063.6	 change, but there, there was a, and I don't know, I'm not like the world's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2067.4s	2067.4	 expert on this history, but somehow they convinced the union to adopt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2070.9s	2070.9	 containerization, which is about, it's far more radical than anything we would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2074.1s	2074.1	 be proposing now in how you would change their workflow or change their work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2078.6s	2078.6	 Like that was complete change where it's really these giant automated or these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2082.8s	2082.8	 giant cranes that replace them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2085.1s	2085.1	 The worker couldn't buy it and deploy his commerce secretary or, I mean, isn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2088.7s	2088.7	 there some cabinet official, he could deputize to say, go solve this problem,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2092.2s	2092.2	 go bring the parties together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2093.4s	2093.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2093.7s	2093.7	 And I think I suspect that'll happen over the coming months because July 1st is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2098.0s	2098.0	 pretty bad timing for a midterm election if they were to go on strike.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2101.7s	2101.7	 And I think he's got a lot of incentive to make sure that he does have the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2105.1s	2105.1	 incentive. It just seems like, I mean, you've been tweeting about this for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2107.9s	2107.9	 months that nobody's paying attention in the administration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2111.4s	2111.4	 I mean, we've all been reading your tweet storm saying like someone in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2114.1s	2114.1	 Washington really should be paying attention to these ideas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2117.0s	2117.0	 It spans over two administrations now, right Ryan?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2119.3s	2119.3	 It's both administrations have been out to lunch on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2123.2s	2123.2	 The union is a really big issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2124.2s	2124.2	 That's going to come up this summer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2125.1s	2125.1	 There's in my view, an even bigger issue that it's gotten even less attention,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2128.9s	2128.9	 which is on January 1st of next year, January 1st, 2023, which is tomorrow in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2133.6s	2133.6	 shipping terms that all the ships in the world will have to reduce their carbon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2138.7s	2138.7	 emissions by 13%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2141.0s	2141.0	 And these are internal combustion engine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2144.8s	2144.8	 There's not a way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2145.6s	2145.6	 Ryan, Ryan, hold on a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2146.8s	2146.8	 Wait, just explain what that means by who's mandating that and how is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2151.1s	2151.1	 enforceable and why is that have to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2153.4s	2153.4	 It's a, it's a, the international maritime organization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2156.3s	2156.3	 It's part of the United Nations and it's the group that is overseeing global
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2159.4s	2159.4	 ocean freight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2160.1s	2160.1	 It's the regulatory body for ocean freight in the world and it's the United
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2163.2s	2163.2	 Nations group.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2163.6s	2163.6	 So any member state of the United Nations must follow the rules of the IMO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2167.8s	2167.8	 And they've all said they will.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2169.3s	2169.3	 Uh, and so the IMO has said all existing ships in the world must reduce their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2173.7s	2173.7	 carbon emissions by 13%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2176.0s	2176.0	 And again, it's an internal combustion engine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2177.4s	2177.4	 We don't know how to make it 13% more carbon efficient, or we would have done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2180.2s	2180.2	 that already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2180.9s	2180.9	 Can you actually buy indirect offsets?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2182.6s	2182.6	 Like, can you go and buy some Amazonian rainforest credits and offset the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2186.4s	2186.4	 no, you can't offset it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2188.0s	2188.0	 Uh, and it's not about the fleet either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2189.6s	2189.6	 So some of these fleets have, uh, LNG liquid natural gas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2194.1s	2194.1	 So the fleet might be more efficient, but it's no, it's down to the individual
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2196.6s	2196.6	 ship and it has to, so there is one way to reduce the emissions of the ship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2200.4s	2200.4	 And that's to go slower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2202.4s	2202.4	 Uh, and if you go 30% slower, then you can achieve a 13% reduction in reduction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2206.7s	2206.7	 in carbon emissions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2207.6s	2207.6	 Well, if you look at it on a per container basis, by the way, it's the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2210.8s	2210.8	 amount of carbon emitted because the ship is still carrying the same number of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2214.4s	2214.4	 containers, just going slower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2216.6s	2216.6	 But it will reduce the supply of shipping capacity and slow everything down another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2220.2s	2220.2	 30%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2221.3s	2221.3	 That that takes place January 1st, 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2223.8s	2223.8	 It's getting very little attention, but to my view, it's going to be massively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2226.5s	2226.5	 disruptive if we slow everything down, reduce the capacity of the network that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2230.3s	2230.3	 much further prices are going to go to the moon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2233.3s	2233.3	 And it's like really asinine law because it doesn't actually achieve any carbon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2237.8s	2237.8	 reduction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2238.2s	2238.2	 The fuel type, correct me if I'm wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2240.0s	2240.0	 Is this like MGO, MDO, like it's dirtier fuel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2243.0s	2243.0	 Is that correct?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2244.2s	2244.2	 So the same group.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2246.1s	2246.1	 IMO actually passed a new lodge January 1st of 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2249.9s	2249.9	 And it got totally, it was supposed to be a huge deal in our industry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2253.4s	2253.4	 And then COVID hit and we all kind of ignored it, but, um, that eliminated the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2257.3s	2257.3	 worst kinds of fuel, uh, sulfur used to be, you could have this bunker fuel that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2261.8s	2261.8	 was up to 3% sulfur.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2263.8s	2263.8	 She led to crazy amounts of sulfuric acid, which is like apparently like 15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2267.3s	2267.3	 times worse than carbon as a greenhouse gas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2269.4s	2269.4	 And so that was eliminated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2271.3s	2271.3	 And now, uh, it's still kind of ugly bunker fuel, but it's not like it used to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2275.5s	2275.5	 be the reputation is probably still carried over from, from pre 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2279.1s	2279.1	 If you could wave your magic wand as we wrap up here and change two or three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2283.0s	2283.0	 things, uh, that to you seem like layups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2286.1s	2286.1	 And I think you kind of hinted at them in order, what would be the changes just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2290.1s	2290.1	 based on your intuition and your knowledge of the supply chain, what two or three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2293.6s	2293.6	 things are the layups we got to do right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2295.9s	2295.9	 I think first off is it's got to start with some, uh, with metrics like what,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2299.9s	2299.9	 if you care about something, measure it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2301.9s	2301.9	 The metric that the government's been using for ocean freight delays has been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2306.5s	2306.5	 how many ships are waiting offshore at the port of Long beach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2310.5s	2310.5	 And this is like one of the most mischievous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2313.0s	2313.0	 I don't know if it was just like outright fraud or incompetence, but one of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2316.8s	2316.8	 worst things I've seen from a government in terms of PR is they, they pass this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2320.9s	2320.9	 rule that the ships have to wait 150 miles offshore so that the carbon, so that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2325.4s	2325.4	 the pollution wouldn't hit LA like reasonable good, but then they kept using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2330.2s	2330.2	 the same metric for how many ships are waiting right outside the port.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2333.4s	2333.4	 And it went way down and they started celebrating that success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2336.3s	2336.3	 So like, let's actually use the right metric, which is how long is it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2340.0s	2340.0	 taking cargo to transport?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2341.8s	2341.8	 You can't just hide the ships and celebrate that there's no ships there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2344.8s	2344.8	 Um, so if we, if we get the government, you're saying that the government pushed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2348.4s	2348.4	 the ships beyond the measurement window and then said they don't exist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2351.8s	2351.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2352.6s	2352.6	 Basically the transportation secretary and the port of LA director got up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2356.4s	2356.4	 This government officials.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2357.3s	2357.3	 When I went to an XL sweater to hide my gut and I was like, I'm thin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2361.4s	2361.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2361.9s	2361.9	 Look, better to look at the scale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2364.5s	2364.5	 So if we at least get them focused on the right metric, which I think we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2368.0s	2368.0	 the best metric right now, we call it the flex port ocean timeliness indicator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2371.8s	2371.8	 It's how long is it taking the cargo to, from when the factory says it's ready
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2375.5s	2375.5	 to when it can be delivered now, any solution that we create, we have a metric.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2379.7s	2379.7	 We know there's a KPI here door to door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2382.7s	2382.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2383.0s	2383.0	 Door to door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2383.6s	2383.6	 You mentioned the transportation secretary was part of that press
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2386.0s	2386.0	 conference where they're taking credit for changing the metric.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2388.1s	2388.1	 So I assume that's Buddha judge who's in charge of dispersing the $1.2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2391.7s	2391.7	 trillion infrastructure bill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2393.7s	2393.7	 Is there any money in the infrastructure bill to solve this problem?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2397.3s	2397.3	 There's, um, there's $17 billion allocated to ports.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2401.6s	2401.6	 I went and read it and I couldn't find any money that was going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2405.0s	2405.0	 to be spent on building ports.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2406.7s	2406.7	 It was like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2408.1s	2408.1	 study, here's the crazy thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2409.7s	2409.7	 We just had this trillion dollar infrastructure bill that's supposed to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2412.1s	2412.1	 modernize and update the infrastructure of the country and it's doing nothing to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2415.4s	2415.4	 solve the most pressing supply chain issue in the country, which is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2419.6s	2419.6	 bottleneck at the ports, which is driving inflation, which is causing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2422.6s	2422.6	 interest rate increases and wrecking the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2424.7s	2424.7	 There's a term in Washington, which is called the Christmas tree bill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2428.2s	2428.2	 And the infrastructure bill is an example of that, which is this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2431.2s	2431.2	 not a directed shot on goal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2432.6s	2432.6	 What this is, is a random tree that you go and hang little things on top of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2438.4s	2438.4	 And eventually the whole thing is covered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2440.2s	2440.2	 So it kind of looks beautiful from afar, but when you get really close to it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2443.9s	2443.9	 it's a little bit chaotic and you don't understand what's going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2446.6s	2446.6	 And so to your point, the fact that Ryan can say there's $17 billion allocated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2451.6s	2451.6	 to something like ports, but it's unclear to him who's an expert in the space,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2455.4s	2455.4	 where that money goes and how it's spent gives us zero chance of figuring this out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2460.1s	2460.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2461.3s	2461.3	 I mean, it was like, it's like things like, Oh, each state must create our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2464.2s	2464.2	 supply chain readiness report about it's like, what are you talking about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2469.5s	2469.5	 Singapore put $20 billion to build a bad-ass automated port.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2475.6s	2475.6	 Like that's like a reasonable thing to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2478.3s	2478.3	 Like let's spend $20 billion, make the most automated, amazing port in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2482.5s	2482.5	 That'd be a good use of government money, but like to then create studies and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2485.4s	2485.4	 consultants, I don't know that any of it's going to hit the ground and shovel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2488.5s	2488.5	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2488.6s	2488.6	 So you're saying, you're saying that $17 billion that goes to, you know, studies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2492.7s	2492.7	 and consultants could actually get redirected and we could pick a port where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2496.3s	2496.3	 there's an amenable city and actually completely modernize it to set the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2499.6s	2499.6	 example of what modern shipping should look like in the United States that at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2503.6s	2503.6	 a minimum matches what's happening in the rest of the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2506.1s	2506.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2506.3s	2506.3	 I think that'd be pretty awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2507.4s	2507.4	 And it doesn't seem to me like science fiction, like the government wants to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2510.3s	2510.3	 build a port who's going to stop the government to build an important port.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2512.5s	2512.5	 That seems too logical and too obvious, Ryan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2514.7s	2514.7	 Well, we can have the ports compete for who gets to get that 20 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2518.3s	2518.3	 and be the modernized port.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2519.3s	2519.3	 Like Amazon held that competition.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2556.4s	2556.4	 Even if that came around, it would take five, six years, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2558.3s	2558.3	 Even if it was done right, you don't get a port overnight.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2572.1s	2572.1	 A key part of problem solving is make sure the problem doesn't get worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2574.9s	2574.9	 So let's assign someone to go work with the union and the company terminal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2579.7s	2579.7	 operators, make sure that they don't go on strike and make sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2583.0s	2583.0	 And then someone needs to go look at this IMO UN thing and figure out if the United

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2589.2s	2589.2	 Well, listen, Ryan, you've been incredibly generous with your knowledge and your

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2605.5s	2605.5	 Like the country owes you a debt, the world owes you a debt to really keep this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2609.8s	2609.8	 problem down to first principles and figure it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2612.7s	2612.7	 And our government should be taking notes and really the other leaders who are

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2619.8s	2619.8	 I don't know if they've reached out, but maybe the, you know, a half dozen of you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2623.2s	2623.2	 can then sit with this administration and the next one and just tell them where to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2627.0s	2627.0	 point the money cannon, because it doesn't seem like they know where to point it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2630.9s	2630.9	 We have a lot of people in Washington that listen to this pod.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2644.9s	2644.9	 Ryan, bring your taco truck to Washington.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2646.8s	2646.8	 One of the big common denominators of both business and politics is that leaders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2650.3s	2650.3	 have to focus on the right problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2652.2s	2652.2	 And when they're not focused on the right problems, like bad things happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2655.0s	2655.0	 And, you know, we know that inflation is a huge problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2658.0s	2658.0	 The Fed now is raising rates or projecting raising rates very quickly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2662.0s	2662.0	 which is creating, it was created a huge market downturn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2664.9s	2664.9	 It's a very blunt instrument.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2666.2s	2666.2	 It could cause a downturn or recession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2668.7s	2668.7	 So that's the big problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2670.7s	2670.7	 And yet there are specific solutions and fixes to the inflation problem by updating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2675.6s	2675.6	 or modernizing the ports that Ryan suggested, but who's focusing on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2679.2s	2679.2	 And now they'd be more strategic, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2680.8s	2680.8	 Sax, it'd be a more strategic sniper shot as opposed to this blunt instrument.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2684.7s	2684.7	 Like, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2685.1s	2685.1	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2685.7s	2685.7	 So, you know, and so what have they been focusing in Washington on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2690.2s	2690.2	 Definitely not this, you know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2692.0s	2692.0	 Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2692.7s	2692.7	 And then I see Ryan post these suggestions on Twitter and then all these people come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2695.8s	2695.8	 in and they're all like fatalistic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2697.2s	2697.2	 Oh, well, the president can't do anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2699.8s	2699.8	 You know, the president can emergency war time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2702.8s	2702.8	 If there was ever a time for presidential leadership, this would be it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2705.0s	2705.0	 What I worry about is that if you're the union leader and you know that you've got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2708.9s	2708.9	 Biden in the White House, who's always going to take their side, why wouldn't you make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2712.4s	2712.4	 your demands more unreasonable?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2714.1s	2714.1	 Yeah, they should be asking for triple time to keep it open overnight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2716.7s	2716.7	 Why wouldn't they?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2717.4s	2717.4	 Do you really?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2718.0s	2718.0	 If you're the leader of that union, do you really believe that Biden's going to break
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2721.6s	2721.6	 your strike?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2722.3s	2722.3	 No way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2723.1s	2723.1	 No way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2724.0s	2724.0	 Ask for quadruple time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2725.8s	2725.8	 Yeah, just make it painful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2727.2s	2727.2	 You should make the most of the crisis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2729.6s	2729.6	 Egregious ask possible.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2781.4s	2781.4	 But Chamath, when you see this, you call this with your spread trade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2785.6s	2785.6	 Maybe you could walk us through what you saw, you know, whatever it was three, four, five

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2791.3s	2791.3	 And at this level with $250 billion wiped off the market cap, what do you what do you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2799.1s	2799.1	 Well, I think the trade did what it was supposed to do, which is in a period of a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2803.0s	2803.0	 volatility, I saw an opportunity to, you know, just reduce my risk exposure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2809.6s	2809.6	 Look, I'm generally long, very risky assets, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2813.6s	2813.6	 I mean, all of us are in the business of building companies that have huge volatility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2819.4s	2819.4	 because all of our companies generate earnings very far in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2824.4s	2824.4	 And so, you know, in November of last year, I was trying to figure out what I could do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2830.0s	2830.0	 to shield myself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2832.0s	2832.0	 And the reason I wanted to shield myself was because I saw Elon and Jeff in part selling,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2836.6s	2836.6	 but also I saw that clearly we were going to go through a period where that high growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2842.0s	2842.0	 tech was going to trade down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2843.8s	2843.8	 So I sold some of that high growth tech, but then I also wanted to figure out a way where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2848.8s	2848.8	 I could be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2850.8s	2850.8	 Less exposed to some of that volatility by continuing to hold what I had, and the best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2855.2s	2855.2	 way that I figured out how to do that was to do the spread trade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2857.8s	2857.8	 And so, you know, what I saw at the time was that there is one business above all others
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2863.7s	2863.7	 that I think is immune amongst big tech from any sort of real long term issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2869.6s	2869.6	 And that's Microsoft. And I think David expressed the reason well, is that it's an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2873.5s	2873.5	 enterprise business now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2875.0s	2875.0	 You know, politicians generally don't tend to care about enterprise businesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2879.2s	2879.2	 They have enormous longitudinal growth in front of them, and they're able to do things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2884.4s	2884.4	 on the margins, specifically around M&A to keep building their business with very little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2889.7s	2889.7	 oversight. And we saw this because they had the courage to do this Activision deal, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2894.4s	2894.4	 know, just a few weeks ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2896.0s	2896.0	 If you could imagine again, no other company in big tech could even dare try to do a 70
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2900.8s	2900.8	 billion dollar acquisition because of the scrutiny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2903.7s	2903.7	 In this climate, it was a bold move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2905.5s	2905.5	 Yes. Yeah, I think it's not a bold move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2907.2s	2907.2	 I actually think it says the obvious, which is Microsoft is beyond the level of regulatory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2912.2s	2912.2	 scrutiny that the rest of big tech actually has because they are consumer businesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2917.3s	2917.3	 The second safest company is Google.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2919.4s	2919.4	 And the reason is that Google has the best of both worlds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2922.2s	2922.2	 They're both a platform because of Android.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2925.1s	2925.1	 But then where they are at risk of being an app, they have an incredible deal with Apple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2930.1s	2930.1	 that blunts that effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2932.2s	2932.2	 And so when Apple talks about all their push to privacy, you still have this very specific
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2937.7s	2937.7	 relationship. And Facebook called it out in their earnings release.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2940.5s	2940.5	 They said, we believe that Google has preferential treatment relative to the rest of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2946.0s	2946.0	 Internet. In that Apple deal, because they pay Apple 15 or 20 billion dollars a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2951.8s	2951.8	 And for people who don't know, that's for search.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2953.8s	2953.8	 The default search on your iPhone goes to Google.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2957.0s	2957.0	 Google pays 15 billion dollars to Apple and the accusation, explain the accusation there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2963.6s	2963.6	 of why that would give them preferential in case people don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2966.0s	2966.0	 Can you think somebody 15 or 20 billion dollars a year, they're less likely to do bad things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2970.1s	2970.1	 to you. They may do bad things to other people, but they're not going to do as many bad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2973.3s	2973.3	 things to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2974.1s	2974.1	 Did you believe that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2975.1s	2975.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2975.5s	2975.5	 That allegation from Zuck?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2976.7s	2976.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2976.9s	2976.9	 Well, no, I don't believe the allegation. But I think that general character, that general
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2981.8s	2981.8	 thing is true. Like you're not going to screw over your partners, you're going to screw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2985.0s	2985.0	 over other people before you screw over your partners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2987.1s	2987.1	 Got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2988.0s	2988.0	 Whether this applies here, it'll have to be borne out in some kind of lawsuit or state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2992.2s	2992.2	 AGs or blah, blah, blah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=2994.6s	2994.6	 But anyways, the I think the point is that every other company has a lot more headwinds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3000.3s	3000.3	 than Microsoft and Google and Big Tech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3002.6s	3002.6	 And then the third thing is was a market observation from Gavin Baker, which I thought
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3006.5s	3006.5	 was incredibly brilliant. And what he said was, when you see a drawdown, meaning when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3013.0s	3013.0	 the markets go down, it'll affect high growth tech first. It ended up touching a bunch of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3019.5s	3019.5	 other areas second, like biotech. But he said this key thing, which is big tech will be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3025.4s	3025.4	 the last to crack. But when they do, they are going to get shot. And so I spent a bunch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3031.1s	3031.1	 of time just trying to figure out when big tech gets cracked, who's going to get cracked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3034.4s	3034.4	 the hardest. And I just kind of wanted to create a spread between those who were the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3039.2s	3039.2	 most inoculated to those that were the most at risk. As it turned out, Netflix puked it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3044.2s	3044.2	 up. Facebook puked it up. Amazon actually got really crushed, even though this past
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3049.9s	3049.9	 day, they had a pretty decent rally because of their earnings, but they really got crushed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3054.0s	3054.0	 So in any event, the trade is what the trade is. The bigger thing is what is going on at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3058.2s	3058.2	 Facebook. And I think what you see are three really important headwinds that Facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3062.8s	3062.8	 called out explicitly. One is that when they talked about usage, kind of flattening, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3070.0s	3070.0	 starting to decay, what they're really talking about is TikTok. And I think what we learned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3076.5s	3076.5	 is that TikTok is an enormous threat, and a huge competitive force now in the consumer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3082.3s	3082.3	 social app ecosystem. The second is that Facebook is fundamentally an app that sits inside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3089.0s	3089.0	 of an ecosystem that is subject to the rules of the platform owner, and that's Apple and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3094.5s	3094.5	 Google. And so this IDFA change, so the change in how you can track advertisers, Facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3100.4s	3100.4	 said is going to have a $10 billion impact in 2022. And then the third thing, which was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3105.7s	3105.7	 more implicit, is in order for them to grow, if you can't grow organically, the only other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3111.3s	3111.3	 way to grow is inorganically. And unfortunately, as we're seeing the regulatory focus on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3116.1s	3116.1	 company is really enormous. And so it was a pretty watershed moment in, I think, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3123.6s	3123.6	 company's discussion of their future. And Mark actually kind of said that as much in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3128.7s	3128.7	 press.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3129.2s	3129.2	 Sacks, you look at this business, you made an interesting observation. Facebook rebranding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3134.4s	3134.4	 itself as meta before meta exists, maybe looked at as another sort of sign that maybe they got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3140.7s	3140.7	 a little tilted, maybe what we should take on the sort of changing the name of the company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3147.8s	3147.8	 before that business really is at scale or exists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3151.4s	3151.4	 Yeah, I mean, it's a bubble move. Because look, when you're in an upmarket, and the market is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3157.6s	3157.6	 super frothy, we had in hindsight, last year was a giant asset bubble funded by all this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3162.9s	3162.9	 liquidity coming out of the Fed and the federal government. So yeah, in a bubble like that, all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3168.8s	3168.8	 investors care about is the growth story. And so Facebook went all in on the story around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3174.5s	3174.5	 Metaverse. But in the cold light of day, you know, once the once the punch came up, yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3180.4s	3180.4	 once the punchbowl has been taken away, and you're in the hangover, and you're in sort of a very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3184.1s	3184.1	 volatile potentially packed it in. Yeah, bear market, investors go, wait a second, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3189.0s	3189.0	 this VR division is losing 10 billion a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3192.9s	3192.9	 It might even be 12, by the way, because they said it was a little higher. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3196.6s	3196.6	 they lost 6 billion last year, they lost 10 billion this year. So the losses are escalating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3201.1s	3201.1	 And so in that kind of market, investors are like, wait a second, do I do I want to invest in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3206.8s	3206.8	 company that whose future is that unclear? I mean, if you look at this, at this market, we've seen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3213.6s	3213.6	 that the growth stocks are down 60, today's an update yesterday was a horrible day. So they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3218.4s	3218.4	 bouncing around 60 70% down off the highs in early November. Okay, but the things are only down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3226.7s	3226.7	 14% or something like that. Right. But Facebook basically took themselves out of the the sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3232.5s	3232.5	 the the market leader bucket and put themselves in the growth bucket. But they're like, you treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3237.0s	3237.0	 us like Peloton. We're speculative. Why would why would they want to do that? You know, now terrible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3241.1s	3241.1	 strategic decision you're saying? Well, it was a it was a decision. It was the kind of decision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3245.8s	3245.8	 where you look back with 2020 hindsight, and you say, look, that kind of decision could only be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3249.4s	3249.4	 made in a bubbly, frothy market, you would never make that decision in the kind of down market you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3254.6s	3254.6	 have today. And other decisions look stupid as well. So PayPal was just down 25%. Okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3261.0s	3261.0	 why was it down? Yeah, well, they just well, no growth and users, it was mostly on the forecast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3266.5s	3266.5	 And yeah, they're they revised their forecast down considerably. And of course, they tried to blame
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3270.7s	3270.7	 it on the economy. But other companies, you know, Amazon just had a huge beat relative expectations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3277.8s	3277.8	 They're up 15% today. So not everybody is blaming the macroeconomic picture the way that PayPal did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3283.8s	3283.8	 any event. My point is, you go back six months ago. And you know, what was PayPal doing, I wrote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3289.6s	3289.6	 a story for Barry Weiss, for her substack about how PayPal was taking the lead in financial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3296.2s	3296.2	 deplatforming, they were working with the ADL and the SPLC to kick to identify groups to kick off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3302.2s	3302.2	 their platform. So that's what management was spending their cycles on figuring out how not to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3307.1s	3307.1	 grow how to kick people off their platform and trying to figure out how to get more people on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3311.4s	3311.4	 Sounds familiar. Who else is trying to get people on the platform?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3314.1s	3314.1	 It's the kind of thing you do. When you're in a frothy market, and your stock is up and you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3318.5s	3318.5	 distracted, you can waste your management cycles on stuff like that. Now their stock is down 25%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3325.0s	3325.0	 You have to wonder, gee, do we wish we had spent our time on other things?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3328.7s	3328.7	 Okay, so Friedberg, I have a question for you about the future. Obviously, Facebook has bet the farm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3334.2s	3334.2	 on meta, they're betting on VR, and I guess eventually AR or what collectively is called XR.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3340.3s	3340.3	 And then we have news that Apple has a seemingly brilliant goggles product coming out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3347.4s	3347.4	 developers are getting into it, and they are the masters of hardware. So now, Zuckerberg has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3353.3s	3353.3	 decided he will be on a collision course with the company that just took $10 billion in revenue from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3358.3s	3358.3	 them by doing the non tracking. And that is the masters of hardware. So we have this collision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3365.0s	3365.0	 course coming. And then just two weeks ago, Google said, Hey, by the way, remember that Google Glass
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3369.9s	3369.9	 thing, we're not giving up on VR AR either. And of course, Microsoft, we all know, has their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3376.2s	3376.2	 HoloLens. So when we look at that four horse race, if you were to bet, and rank who's going to win,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3382.6s	3382.6	 Apple, goggles, Google Glass, whatever they're going to call the new thing, HoloLens and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3388.0s	3388.0	 Metas, Oculus, who's going to win? And what do you how do you look at that competition between the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3392.4s	3392.4	 big four? I don't know if that's a race you want to be in. So I like that answer. Race to nowhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3398.9s	3398.9	 Have you guys used the Oculus Quest device? Absolutely. I have two of them. Try Oh my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3404.8s	3404.8	 if you play the games where you like move continuously through space. And like when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3409.6s	3409.6	 do that, it's like you're gonna throw up. I mean, I'm not sure that this notion that that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3415.8s	3415.8	 becomes the new computing modality is like a fair and true notion. And so, you know, there may it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3421.9s	3421.9	 may end up becoming kind of a niche entertainment device, almost like a Nintendo Switch where there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3427.4s	3427.4	 you know, a mode when you're using it, but I'm not sure it replaces traditional static,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3432.2s	3432.2	 two dimensional computing in front of you. The jury's still out. I don't see like a computer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3436.8s	3436.8	 sentiment that says these things will ultimately kind of prevail over the current mode. So,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3443.6s	3443.6	 you know, who's gonna work? Who would win? In your mind? Who's got the best chance? Let's assume
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3449.7s	3449.7	 we're all going to use it every day for two hours as our desktop, we're going to put it on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3453.5s	3453.5	 we're going to find workout apps to use whatever it's going to become. Let's let's assume you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3458.5s	3458.5	 that I think you just answered your own question in in in all of these things, when you build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3463.9s	3463.9	 hardware, I think you can take a lot of parallels from what happened in the PC space. If you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3469.4s	3469.4	 commoditized PC manufacturers, compact Dell, IBM, right, there are innumerable number of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3474.7s	3474.7	 thousands of companies that made PCs, the value created to the application layer to the operating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3479.9s	3479.9	 system. And the people that can actually build ecosystems are typically the ones that win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3485.7s	3485.7	 And the people that already have an ecosystem and all all they have to do is port somebody from,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3490.6s	3490.6	 you know, platform A to platform B has a meaningful advantage over somebody that has to convince you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3496.1s	3496.1	 to come to a new platform altogether. And so you know, if you're a Microsoft and you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3501.3s	3501.3	 1000s or hundreds of 1000s of developers, or if you're Google, and you have hundreds of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3506.1s	3506.1	 1000s of developers, or if you're Apple, and you have millions of developers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3510.8s	3510.8	 it's just a smaller bridge to cross in order to convince them to now go for one extra endpoint,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3516.6s	3516.6	 iOS versus Android, you know, versus Microsoft. And by the way, it seems like the obvious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3522.5s	3522.5	 transition, whereas like Facebook is like, you got to go build all this stuff. And Apple made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3528.2s	3528.2	 an incredibly important set of decisions a few years ago, which I didn't think a lot of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3533.0s	3533.0	 talked about, but they had an OS tree that was branching far too widely, right, they had a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3539.0s	3539.0	 different operating system for the phones, they had a different operating system for iPads,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3545.8s	3545.8	 desktop for watches, and they've started to try to converge and chew on these things into into a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3550.8s	3550.8	 set of basic primitives, so that it's more controllable. And I suspect the reason is because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3556.1s	3556.1	 that gives them more optionality to go into a car to go into a headset, without having to do an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3562.3s	3562.3	 entire developer, even better than that. Chamath is a great point you bring up because they also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3566.8s	3566.8	 started investing in their own chipset. And I think all of that chipset innovation gives them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3571.9s	3571.9	 a dramatic advantage in having smaller batteries and more processing power in a headset, if it does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3578.2s	3578.2	 work, which what chips does what chip asset does Facebook have none. So I don't want to I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3583.9s	3583.9	 think we should say that Facebook is down or now, but let's just qualify what we think can win. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3588.9s	3588.9	 that's one thing. The other thing to remember is when you look at the PC industry,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3593.0s	3593.0	 how did Intel become so dominant part of what Intel was able to do to outcompete AMD and everybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3598.6s	3598.6	 else was that program called Intel inside, which is effectively these co marketing pass through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3603.5s	3603.5	 dollars that they would use to actually give an incentive for Dell and for compact and for all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3609.1s	3609.1	 these other folks to basically build the spec and that was the wind tell monopoly, right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3613.8s	3613.8	 Microsoft and Intel. If you play that out in VR, what you really need is just a bag full of cash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3619.8s	3619.8	 because if you give developers a subsidized incentive to build for your platform, they'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3623.9s	3623.9	 do it. So then, again, if you rank the companies, you just need to look at how much cash do they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3629.1s	3629.1	 have because those are the most cash. So again, I think the best way to think about this is how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3633.9s	3633.9	 many developers do you have today? How much cash do you have today? How much cash will you have in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3638.9s	3638.9	 the future? And you can probably rank and just do a reasonable expected value to think about who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3644.2s	3644.2	 has the best chance of winning assuming the platform is roughly equal. Now, if the if the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3650.1s	3650.1	 if the if the company on that list with the fewest developers and the least money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3654.9s	3654.9	 has a superior device, if that device is superior enough, they can overcome those things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3659.9s	3659.9	 right? And Facebook has the least money and Facebook has the least if you have rough parity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3665.3s	3665.3	 I think the person with the most money and the most developers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3670.1s	3670.1	 Sachs, Facebook has the least developers, they have no relationship with developers. In fact,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3674.8s	3674.8	 they kind of screwed them over with Facebook Connect a couple times, they have the least money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3678.6s	3678.6	 but they do have the largest user base of profiles. So does that give them some advantage here? And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3685.0s	3685.0	 how would you rank who's going to win? Who's going to lose? Well, I think it gives them an advantage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3689.0s	3689.0	 in to Tumas framework of porting over their app onto whatever the dominant platform is going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3694.7s	3694.7	 be. But probably it's the operating system players who are probably going to be able to extend their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3700.3s	3700.3	 operating system into this new VR AR world probably. What I wonder about is, would Facebook have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3706.6s	3706.6	 been better off if they're going to run a $10 billion a year money losing division that's highly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3712.0s	3712.0	 speculative? Would they have been better off gambling that on building their own phone? Or maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3717.4s	3717.4	 their own like forked version of an Android phone? And the reason why I say that is-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3721.9s	3721.9	 The project that I started. I was about to say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3724.3s	3724.3	 Well, we talked about that. We've now seen-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3726.4s	3726.4	 I was about to say, let's not re-dig that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3728.5s	3728.5	 Well, they're losing $10 billion a year now because of this one permissions change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3732.4s	3732.4	 that Apple has made, right? Because they're completely dependent on Apple's operating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3736.9s	3736.9	 system for a big portion of their revenue. So what is their defense against that? I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3741.4s	3741.4	 they're really pretty helpless. If you look, just to make a comparison, if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3745.4s	3745.4	 look at the strategic brilliance of Google, what was it? First of all, after they came up with this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3749.8s	3749.8	 cash cow, the idea of search, and then they combined it with the sort of keyword auction they got from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3754.8s	3754.8	 Overture, they said that, listen, the next strategic move is we can't let anybody disintermediate us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3761.0s	3761.0	 So what did they do? They started moving upstream. The first sort of upstream player was the portal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3766.6s	3766.6	 right? So they start competing against Yahoo. They gave away Gmail. Then it was the browser.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3771.1s	3771.1	 So it was Microsoft Explorer. So they gave away Chrome. Then it was the operating system. They
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3775.1s	3775.1	 gave away Androids. They said, we're not going to let anybody else be upstream of us. And so they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3779.4s	3779.4	 just started replacing all those layers of the stack, giving away free products with free-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3784.2s	3784.2	 With Office. Yeah. Sorry. And a good free product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3786.8s	3786.8	 Yeah. Great. I mean, all those-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3787.9s	3787.9	 And they all have billions of users.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3789.4s	3789.4	 I'll also say a big part of the monetization lock-in was Google then extended into the publishers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3794.6s	3794.6	 very quickly with the acquisition of AdSense. And the publishers then allowed Google to offer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3799.4s	3799.4	 the greatest CPM that those publishers could have over any other advertising network.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3804.1s	3804.1	 And as a result, Google built their network and then built their advertiser base. And they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3808.2s	3808.2	 effectively got this huge lock-in. The only disruptive threat to Google was what Facebook did,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3814.9s	3814.9	 which is to create demographic profiles where instead of targeting ads based on keyword
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3819.3s	3819.3	 or search intent, you could now target ads based on demographic. And then Facebook took it a step
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3823.8s	3823.8	 further and did retargeting. So basically following you across multiple sites, but Facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3829.0s	3829.0	 always knew. And as we just discovered, that was always going to be a weak point for them because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3833.2s	3833.2	 they were dependent upon hardware devices that were going to let them do that tracking across
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3837.6s	3837.6	 apps and across sites. And that's why Google always had this kind of key lock-in advantage that will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3843.8s	3843.8	 persist. And the network is just so big on both sides, you can't compete.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3848.1s	3848.1	 To Sachs' thought bomb, if they had invested in a phone, let's say they made a thousand dollar-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3853.4s	3853.4	 Let's say they made a phone with a bomb of $800 or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3855.8s	3855.8	 They just did this, by the way. Just remember the Fire TV, the Fire phone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3859.5s	3859.5	 He gave a bunch of great speeches. You can watch these and what happened with that. And just,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3863.4s	3863.4	 you know, despite his extraordinarily large user base, his committed loyal users, all these reasons,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3869.1s	3869.1	 his magical, talented, technical team, he hired the best people. He also tried to do the same with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3874.6s	3874.6	 search, by the way, with A9. And remember Apple also tried to do the same with search. All these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3878.4s	3878.4	 guys tried to kind of compete. It's not easy to execute. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3881.4s	3881.4	 It's not easy to execute. And you get a lock-in with the network value, but you also get a lock-in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3885.4s	3885.4	 with the talent. And, you know, this was a really hard thing to pull off and you have to get it all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3889.4s	3889.4	 right. So let me ask Chamath a question based on what Sachs said. Should they have deployed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3893.4s	3893.4	 10 billion into phones? If we go back two years and they did deploy 10 billion into phones,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3898.4s	3898.4	 they take an $800 bomb, which is probably what the best iPhone cost. I think it cost 700 for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3903.2s	3903.2	 Apple to make and they still have for 1500. They could basically give the phone away for half price,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3908.2s	3908.2	 maybe give it away for four or $500. That's what Fire Phone was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3911.7s	3911.7	 And if they gave away for $400 and you had to be a Facebook user, you buy it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3915.0s	3915.0	 they get the credit card of the person that would be, they could put 25 million phones into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3919.5s	3919.5	 the market every year. That's what Amazon thought. And I don't think that moves the needle. So you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3923.9s	3923.9	 don't think it would work. It didn't create a better user experience for users. Users got a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3927.2s	3927.2	 better experience with the iPhone. Okay. And then they got a better experience with Android.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3931.0s	3931.0	 The window of time was in 2009, 10 and 11 when there wasn't lock-in. And, you know, I think that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3939.6s	3939.6	 been well discussed about what we were doing and what we tried to do. So there's no point rehashing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3944.7s	3944.7	 Why did Facebook give that up? Because there wasn't an initiative, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3947.4s	3947.4	 It wasn't that. It came down to, you know, an ask that I made that we didn't get and it didn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3954.9s	3954.9	 happen. So it didn't happen. We'll leave it at that. I'm not saying that would have been successful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3961.1s	3961.1	 Neither did I. We didn't get to the starting line. So we'll never know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3963.4s	3963.4	 In fact, I think it's unlikely that it would have worked because I'm not sure exactly what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3966.4s	3966.4	 Facebook's value prop would have been. My point is just if you're going to lose $10 billion a year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3970.7s	3970.7	 on a division, wouldn't it be better for it to be something strategically vital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3975.3s	3975.3	 as opposed to something that feels a little bit optional?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3977.5s	3977.5	 Even if the majority chances you don't win, the question is if you had a 20, 30, 35% chance of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3983.6s	3983.6	 being a player in smartphones, would you take that chance? And I think you have no choice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3987.8s	3987.8	 but to take that chance and it would be worth it. The expected value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3991.0s	3991.0	 Yeah. One thing I'll say in defense of Facebook is I think that all of this like anti-trust
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=3995.0s	3995.0	 scrutiny is a little bit ridiculous today. And it looks pretty ridiculous. And let me just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4000.1s	4000.1	 explain why. It seems that capitalism is pretty much working as intended because if you looked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4006.0s	4006.0	 at Google's results, if you looked at Snap's results, at Pinterest's results, at Amazon's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4011.9s	4011.9	 results, there is a vibrant and growing advertising ecosystem. By no means could you claim that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4017.8s	4017.8	 Facebook has any real monopoly on that, number one. And when you fold in TikTok, it's absolutely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4023.3s	4023.3	 true. And then if you think about the usage curve of TikTok, there's a check and balance there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4029.0s	4029.0	 on usage. And so anybody that thinks that Facebook is a monopoly today, I think is a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4034.2s	4034.2	 misguided. So really, I think what politicians need to do today, February 4th, is be a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4041.4s	4041.4	 bit more honest about what they really care about, which is really around section 230 and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4045.8s	4045.8	 misinformation, disinformation, fears that they have related to Facebook's distribution power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4050.5s	4050.5	 Because now if you're going to try to legislate this company, it's really unfair, like especially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4054.9s	4054.9	 going back 10 years to litigate an acquisition, you'd never do that to any other company that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4059.9s	4059.9	 you know, is sort of maybe on the back half of their growth cycle. It just doesn't make any sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4064.6s	4064.6	 It would be like going after Google now for the YouTube acquisition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4067.1s	4067.1	 Amazon reported $31 billion of advertising revenue. There is a vibrant, diverse advertising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4074.6s	4074.6	 ecosystem. Facebook is not in control of that ecosystem. And so trying to legislate them as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4079.4s	4079.4	 a monopoly in that ecosystem is insane today. What do you think, Sacks? Do you think this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4083.8s	4083.8	 regulation is based on the fact that Facebook kicked off Trump and is scaring politicians over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4089.8s	4089.8	 actual competitive reality? I think that politicians are using the threat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4094.2s	4094.2	 of regulation to try and drive the speech policies they want on these social networks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4100.7s	4100.7	 That's what's really going on. I mean, the merits of the case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4102.9s	4102.9	 So you agree with me. It's nothing to do with the business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4105.3s	4105.3	 Yeah, look, who should get regulated on antitrust grounds? Apple. You know, Apple is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4110.2s	4110.2	 and maybe Google. Why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4111.6s	4111.6	 Well, they're the big monopolists. I mean, they control the operating system. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4114.6s	4114.6	 those guys. 90% of search.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4116.6s	4116.6	 And I would say Amazon with respect to the verticals where they're competing with their own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4121.4s	4121.4	 Yeah, basics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4122.9s	4122.9	 With the basics. Exactly. So in other words, when you control an operating system and then there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4127.8s	4127.8	 developers or other, you know, downstream players on that ecosystem, you have to treat them fairly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4133.3s	4133.3	 You can't privilege your own policy to then dominate vertical after vertical. So there are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4138.2s	4138.2	 real antitrust concerns with those three companies, with Facebook, way less so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4142.2s	4142.2	 And yet they get the brunt of the attacks. Why? Because the people in Washington are trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4147.0s	4147.0	 coerce Facebook into controlling what they call misinformation, which is really just speech they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4152.1s	4152.1	 don't like. And that is highly inappropriate. Perfect segue. Last week, we didn't jump into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4157.6s	4157.6	 the Rogan Spotify debate. Maybe we should have. But we'll talk about it now with a lot more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4163.4s	4163.4	 context. Obviously, Neil Young and some other folks that were pulling our music off journey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4168.6s	4168.6	 Mitchell, whatever some actual high profile bloggers said they don't want to be on there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4173.0s	4173.0	 And then Joe Rogan and Daniel Ech both decided to talk about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4178.7s	4178.7	 Joe Rogan said, Listen, I'm a comedian, I don't prepare for these interviews.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4183.4s	4183.4	 And I just see where they go. But this show has gotten very influential. It's the number one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4188.6s	4188.6	 podcast in the world's got ridiculous listenership. So maybe I should right now have it right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4194.5s	4194.5	 maybe I should have it labeled. And his and maybe I should have people on afterwards. And maybe I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4199.8s	4199.8	 should do some extra fact checking. I thought it was the best non apology, you know, explain ology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4206.8s	4206.8	 of an apology, because he did say I'm sorry if you don't like it. But he did kind of say that he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4212.1s	4212.1	 would do better. And then Daniel said, and then I'll let you guys comment, Daniel said, Listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4218.1s	4218.1	 we produce shows, and we approve guests for the ringer. And for gimlet, which we own those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4224.8s	4224.8	 studios, we licensed Joe Rogan, we don't do any editing on his show, and we will remove ones after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4231.8s	4231.8	 the fact, but it's a licensing veil. Therefore, we're not a publisher. I'm curious what you thought
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4238.2s	4238.2	 Friedberg on the non apology, and capability for someone like Joe Rogan having guests on who are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4244.8s	4244.8	 anti vax or, you know, maybe are debatable in terms of science, because he is a comedian. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4252.2s	4252.2	 as he says, like the show is kind of big now. So maybe I should do a little fact checking. What do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4255.7s	4255.7	 you think he should do when he has scientists and people and people on I'll make two points. One is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4260.6s	4260.6	 I don't think that journalism is regulated in the sense that you know, we have freedom of speech. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4266.0s	4266.0	 anyone can stand up and they can say, I have this belief or I have discovered this fact. And you may
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4272.4s	4272.4	 not actually hold that belief and that fact may not be true. But you're still allowed to stand up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4276.6s	4276.6	 and say it and you're still allowed to have someone come on and say it. And so I don't think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4280.5s	4280.5	 there's any disclosure obligation. He's putting on a show, it's the same as any new show or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4283.9s	4283.9	 entertainment show. I don't think that there's a clear line or boundary. I mean, what the heck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4287.7s	4287.7	 do we do here? We've all got opinions. We try and talk about the news, we talk about our perspectives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4292.8s	4292.8	 on the future. You know, what the heck is it that we're doing here? You know, there's no kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4297.0s	4297.0	 clear line there. So I don't think that he has any obligations to do anything he doesn't want to do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4300.6s	4300.6	 except if and when his audience tells him or the listeners that he cares about tell him,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4304.9s	4304.9	 his customers tell him, this is what we expect and want from you. And then he responds to his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4308.7s	4308.7	 customers. That's the way the market works. And that's the way the enterprise system should work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4312.9s	4312.9	 I think the separate bigger question here that's really important and worth noting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4317.4s	4317.4	 you know, and I just want to speak about this for one second. All of the great internet companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4321.9s	4321.9	 started with this notion that they were creating democratization, that they were creating access
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4326.8s	4326.8	 to information that didn't exist, whether it's access to media or access to search
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4331.4s	4331.4	 results or access to the content or whatever that may not have been available to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4336.2s	4336.2	 And that was a driving force for the entrepreneurs and the founders that started all these businesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4340.2s	4340.2	 And all of them had these very idealistic points of view that we're not going to sensor,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4344.3s	4344.3	 we're not going to take a point of view, we're not going to put our foot down and say what is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4347.5s	4347.5	 and isn't going to be displayed or shown or made available to our users, we're going to let users
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4351.5s	4351.5	 choose what they want to get access to and what they want to hear and listen to. And in all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4355.6s	4355.6	 cases, from Google to YouTube to Twitter, and now to Spotify, the idea of being just an access,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4363.4s	4363.4	 a platform for access is proving to be wrong. All of them are de facto publishers. They ultimately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4369.3s	4369.3	 have to make decisions about what they do and don't let on the platform. And de facto, if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4373.7s	4373.7	 let something on the platform, you're giving it permission, you're giving it a voice, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4377.2s	4377.2	 giving it amplification, and you're giving it access. And so all of them are now getting caught
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4381.9s	4381.9	 up in this problem that I don't think anyone from Larry or Sergey or Jack Dorsey or Daniel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4388.6s	4388.6	 Eck ever wanted to be in. They all wanted to be these democratization platforms. And now they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4393.1s	4393.1	 finding that there is no way to avoid being treated like a publisher. And a publisher has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4397.4s	4397.4	 someone that's called an editor, and an editor decides what is and isn't put on that publishing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4401.9s	4401.9	 platform, as has always been the case in old media. And now in new media, they're all kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4406.2s	4406.2	 of stumbling into this problem. And they're not set up for it. And it's creating issues where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4410.3s	4410.3	 people on the right are saying you're censoring us, and people on the left are saying you're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4413.8s	4413.8	 giving us access to information we want. And it's, you know, it's just kind of the I think the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4418.6s	4418.6	 transition that none of them expected, but we're all seeing happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4421.4s	4421.4	 Chamath, if Daniel Eck is giving $100 million to Joe Rogan, can he claim, listen, it's just we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4429.5s	4429.5	 a platform when you know, listen, we're on Spotify as well, but they don't pay us. Doesn't it change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4435.8s	4435.8	 the relationship when they give him the 100 million? Or can Daniel say, you know, intellectually,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4440.9s	4440.9	 honestly, like, hey, listen, we're not responsible for this. I mean, they're backing up the Brink
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4444.5s	4444.5	 Struck. And they're promoting it like heck. Are they a publisher or not? In your mind?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4449.4s	4449.4	 I read yesterday that Barack and Michelle Obama's deal with Spotify just expired, and they're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4456.2s	4456.2	 to shop it, I suspect that somebody will pay them 10s of millions of dollars to produce content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4462.7s	4462.7	 That's not illegal. And it's a sign of a free market that's working. Spotify has a business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4470.1s	4470.1	 to run. And that business is to get content in front of the users that are paying them a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4476.9s	4476.9	 money on a monthly basis to get access to that stuff. And so who are we to say how Spotify should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4483.1s	4483.1	 run their business? I think you have a choice. Neil Young expressed his choice. There was a person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4488.6s	4488.6	 in the New York Times, she took her podcast off of Spotify. There are subscribers that probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4493.5s	4493.5	 left, but then there are also subscribers that probably joined. And paid. And paid. And so the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4500.6s	4500.6	 reality is that's the free market, being allowed to choose, and being allowed to vote with their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4505.9s	4505.9	 feet. And I think that all sides of that are in the right. So I think Spotify should be allowed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4512.5s	4512.5	 to run their business. I think Joe Rogan should be allowed to say what he wants. If he's allowed to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4517.7s	4517.7	 wants if Spotify chooses to put a disclaimer in front of that podcast, that's their right. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4522.3s	4522.3	 that's good too. And if Joe Rogan decides that he wants to have you know, point counterpoint
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4528.8s	4528.8	 across podcasts or within a podcast, that's laudable as well. And that should be his decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4533.6s	4533.6	 But I don't think people should be forced to make these decisions by law, because I think we get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4537.8s	4537.8	 into a very slippery slope. Because you don't totally understand the incentives of the lawmaker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4542.6s	4542.6	 there. And we have a free market as you're pointing out, Shema. The free market is working
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4547.6s	4547.6	 perfectly. And more people don't like this free market. More important than the free market,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4551.7s	4551.7	 we have a founding document of principles that we all agree to. Yes. Unfortunately,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4556.1s	4556.1	 there's a lot of people who don't agree to it. That's as we have a right. Let's go to our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4560.3s	4560.3	 constitutional attorney counselor. Take us there. If you're talking about the principle of free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4565.4s	4565.4	 speech, there's a lot of people who don't believe in it. That's the problem. First of all, you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4569.0s	4569.0	 this geriatric hippie. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Can I finish? Let me finish my rant, Jake. Okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4575.9s	4575.9	 you got this geriatric hit. I love Neil Young. Wait, sorry, sex just there. That was J Cal seeing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4582.2s	4582.2	 oh, shit, he's gonna get a bell claster clip. He had to interrupt you there. That's really brutal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4592.9s	4592.9	 I thought you were talking about Joe Biden. Can I explain? Go ahead. What happens? I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4598.3s	4598.3	 frankly, you guys are completely missing it. The wheel of censorship broke on Joe Rogan this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4603.8s	4603.8	 They tried to Alex Jones him and it failed. Okay. First, you have this geriatric hippie,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4609.1s	4609.1	 Neil Young, who somehow has turned into a narc. And he plants a flag and he tries to get all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4614.5s	4614.5	 people behind him. And the very online crowd says, Yes, we got to cancel Rogan. And then you got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4619.6s	4619.6	 Jen Psaki from the White House weighing in, bringing in the coercive power of the administration on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4625.2s	4625.2	 side of censorship. Okay. And what happens? Rogan comes out with this non-policy, like you said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4630.6s	4630.6	 and he seems so reasonable. He's a guy who's inquisitive. He's on the side of just asking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4635.5s	4635.5	 questions. He's on the side of balance. He says, Yeah, look, I want to present both sides of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4639.8s	4639.8	 issue. And everybody was like, there is no reason to be censoring this guy. Rogan is an every man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4646.2s	4646.2	 And if they would censor him, they would censor every man. And that is why there was enormous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4651.0s	4651.0	 backlash to it. And everybody has opposed this. And so I think this is the week that this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4656.5s	4656.5	 ridiculous idea of censorship has broke. Now, it would be nice if everybody to Chimass Point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4661.9s	4661.9	 did agree with this principle, but they don't. The fact of the matter is, J. Cal, that censorship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4667.8s	4667.8	 is now the official position of the Democrat Party. And you see it in the poll numbers. There was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4673.6s	4673.6	 great tweet that- Glenn Greenwald- Glenn Greenwald posted where he showed the polling numbers on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4679.2s	4679.2	 So, okay, you go back to the days of the Obama administration, both Democrats and Republicans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4685.2s	4685.2	 agreed that the US government and tech companies should not get involved in this type of censorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4691.1s	4691.1	 But today, there's been a bifurcation. Democrats or lean Democrats versus Republicans who lean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4696.9s	4696.9	 Republicans. It's 6528 in favor of government taking steps to restrict info online. And it's 7637
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4706.0s	4706.0	 Democrats versus Republicans on tech companies. So the First Amendment is no longer a consensus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4711.8s	4711.8	 And that is fundamentally the issue. But I got to tell you, I think there is a backlash against
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4716.3s	4716.3	 this. And I think that most of the country now, and I think this is where they went too far,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4722.1s	4722.1	 is that Rogan is not Alex Jones. He's not Trump. He's not Milo Yiannopoulos. He seems like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4728.0s	4728.0	 reasonable guy. He is the biggest figure in independent journalism. He gets 11 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4732.6s	4732.6	 viewers every week. And I think there's a lot of people, especially young people, who are going,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4737.2s	4737.2	 this has gone too far. And by the way, I do not think Obama ever would have made this political
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4741.9s	4741.9	 blunder of effectively denouncing Rogan because Obama tried to appeal to young voters. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4748.2s	4748.2	 think Jen Psaki, by putting the administration on the side of the censorship, they've made a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4752.5s	4752.5	 huge mistake. And the same week, we saw that Tucker Carlson now gets more young Democrats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4759.3s	4759.3	 listening to his show than CNN and MSNBC. And I'm telling you, this is the reason why.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4765.0s	4765.0	 Okay, Henry, you can put in the roaring crowd of applause at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4770.3s	4770.3	 The best thing that I saw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4771.8s	4771.8	 You've got big problems. I'm telling you, Jay Kyle, you've got big problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4772.9s	4772.9	 I'm an independent. Stop making me the Democratic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4774.2s	4774.2	 You've got big problems in the Democratic Party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4775.4s	4775.4	 I'm an independent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4776.8s	4776.8	 There are now more Tucker Democrats, okay, among the key young demographic that CNN Democrats-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4782.5s	4782.5	 In your writer's room or on Tucker's writer's room? Which way?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4784.9s	4784.9	 Right. I'm a Tucker Democrat, Jay Kyle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4786.8s	4786.8	 You're a Tucker. You are. You love Obama. You love Clinton. I think what's happening is that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4792.7s	4792.7	 I mean, and Chamath, you've said this over and over again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4795.0s	4795.0	 Chamath?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4796.4s	4796.4	 I'm sorry. Chamath Pallabhatiya. You had on one side, you know, the right lost their mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4802.4s	4802.4	 and the alt-right, now they've come a little bit more center. And then you may not have the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4806.5s	4806.5	 Democrats have lost their minds. The fact that anybody can't look at Joe Rogan and say he's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4811.8s	4811.8	 comedian. He worked on a show where they fed people shakes of blended insects, field factor,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4818.7s	4818.7	 and he's taking mushrooms. And he's like, why are you taking me so seriously?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4822.4s	4822.4	 Well, wait, I think you're being super dismissive of Joe Rogan. I think he's actually, as Sac said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4828.9s	4828.9	 a pretty reasonable, curious person. And then, yeah, he does the stuff that everybody else does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4833.5s	4833.5	 He doesn't prepare for the show. He literally said, I don't prepare for the show. I don't do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4836.8s	4836.8	 any preparation. Maybe he doesn't. No, he said explicitly he doesn't. And he fact checks in real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4841.4s	4841.4	 time. So you got to keep your expectation at a certain level with Joe Rogan, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4844.6s	4844.6	 I think that that's implausible to believe. I know that that's what he said, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4850.1s	4850.1	 11 million people a week, $100 million deal, I do suspect that he does some sort of preparation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4855.0s	4855.0	 I don't think he's a he's completely winging it. Okay. He literally said he winks it. But okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4860.1s	4860.1	 I understand that. But I think that's not the point. Okay. Okay. The point is whether he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4865.1s	4865.1	 prepares or not, the excuses and sorry, the dog ate my homework. It's Hey, listen, I have a right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4870.5s	4870.5	 to have this guy on my show. Just like I have the right to have this other guy on my show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4875.8s	4875.8	 You can listen to both and then you can decide for yourself. You could change the channel. Okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4879.8s	4879.8	 that's the important point. So Jason, I would not like try to make this whole argument about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4883.4s	4883.4	 whether he was prepared or unprepared as the excuse. It's whether you believe there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4887.7s	4887.7	 fundamental right to free speech, or whether you believe that people who disagree can disavow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4893.1s	4893.1	 people and get them canceled and get them. Yeah, I obviously don't agree. I don't agree. Anybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4897.3s	4897.3	 should be canceled. I think he should keep going. Whatever Rogan's level of preparation, which I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4900.9s	4900.9	 think is actually pretty high, that people who are accusing him of putting out misinformation are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4905.7s	4905.7	 far more guilty of it themselves. And I think one of the best points in Rogan's non apology,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4910.9s	4910.9	 as you called it is, he said, Listen, a lot of the things that we used to consider misinformation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4916.9s	4916.9	 are now the truth. For example, we talked about it on the show. Yeah, well, we've been ahead of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4921.0s	4921.0	 the curve and calling all this stuff out, you know, we could have been accused of misinformation. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4924.6s	4924.6	 examples, the lab leak theory used to be consumer information, the cloth mask, not doing anything,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4930.1s	4930.1	 listen, Dan Bongino was kicked off YouTube two weeks before the CD for saying that clock Dan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4935.4s	4935.4	 Bongino, he's a pretty big conservative commentator. Okay, he's got an audience of millions, you can be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4940.5s	4940.5	 dismissive, but a lot of people like him, Jake, how but look, my point is, he was kicked off YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4945.0s	4945.0	 for saying cloth masks don't work, then the CDC comes out two weeks later, and says the same thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4950.2s	4950.2	 Right. I think that's a valid point. Yeah. Well, it's the key point. I personally like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4954.8s	4954.8	 for example, we've talked about this thing where like, if you look at like the top distributed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4958.2s	4958.2	 links on Facebook, who do you see Ben Shapiro, Dan Bongino, you know, bright, Joe Rogan, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4964.9s	4964.9	 Yeah, my takeaway with all of these things is there are people of those things, if I listen to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4968.7s	4968.7	 I'd probably find a porin. But there are people there that are probably I would be, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4973.3s	4973.3	 I would, I would, I would, they would appeal to me. In all cases, they should all exist, though,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4978.3s	4978.3	 because the whole point is, let me spider my way through this stuff and figure out for myself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4982.1s	4982.1	 Yeah, what works and what doesn't work. Yeah, more speech is the best counter. The summary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4986.9s	4986.9	 of this that makes the most sense is Elon tweeted this out, Nick, you can put this because I gave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4991.1s	4991.1	 you the image, but it's a it's a meme of Neil Young, where it says, if you won't censor the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=4996.2s	4996.2	 guy I don't like, I won't let you listen to keep on rocking in a free world. And it's and it's just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5003.4s	5003.4	 so true, which is like, on the one hand, you know, you are a standard bearer. Now, maybe what we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5009.3s	5009.3	 should really do is talk about what has happened to this boomer generation over the last 50 years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5015.2s	5015.2	 where they were, you know, sex, drugs, rock and roll, no war in Vietnam, let's fight for our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5020.9s	5020.9	 rights. Let's fight for equality, then punk rock, you know, no, I'm talking about just those, those,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5026.1s	5026.1	 those folks back then, who are now 50 years later, you know, sitting on $70 trillion of wealth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5032.5s	5032.5	 and who are basically like, you can't say this, you can't say that don't do this, don't do that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5036.8s	5036.8	 wear masks, don't leave your house. You know, yeah, vouchers, right? They're scared because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5041.5s	5041.5	 they're old, where math don't or you're getting a pangolin. Yeah, you know, this is I mean, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5046.0s	5046.0	 generation, I think we all have some soul searching to do about what happened to that generation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5050.5s	5050.5	 I think they're scared because they're old, and they feel like they're going to die from COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5053.4s	5053.4	 Is it that generation? Or is it the fact that every generation rebels against the prior and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5058.0s	5058.0	 ultimately becomes conservative? And you know, that's the maybe that's just how life goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5063.0s	5063.0	 I don't think they've become conservative. I think they've become authoritarian. What happened is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5067.1s	5067.1	 they're now in power, the boomers are in power, they've been making the decisions for the last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5071.6s	5071.6	 20 years. I think there is enormous popular discontent with the way the country's been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5076.7s	5076.7	 run over the last two decades, the futile pointless wars in the Middle East, the debt,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5081.7s	5081.7	 the economy, the unfairness that it goes on and on. And what's and especially with COVID, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5086.9s	5086.9	 this COVID policy over the last two years has been a fiasco. And the point of this censorship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5091.8s	5091.8	 of misinformation is to suppress the debate. I mean, what ultimately is the point on take,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5097.8s	5097.8	 for example, COVID of saying that people cannot take a point of view, it is to stifle the debate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5103.5s	5103.5	 that's to prevent an honest debate on these issues. And the people have an interest in doing that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5109.0s	5109.0	 the people who are in charge and are failing. And if you gave people the information, they'd be voted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5113.9s	5113.9	 out of office. If you look when I asked what are the specific claims that either Joe Rogan or his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5119.8s	5119.8	 guests made that people are objecting to a lot of the people who are objecting and wanted him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5123.4s	5123.4	 censored, really didn't know. And one of them was he said early on, I don't know for a young person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5129.2s	5129.2	 who's in shape, if I would advise them to take the vaccine, I know a lot of people who have that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5133.8s	5133.8	 position, which is like if you're young, and I think actually, Freberg, you might have said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5138.0s	5138.0	 mRNA early on in this podcast is a very new technology. And I could see people wanting to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5143.8s	5143.8	 wait and see. Did you not say that? I don't want to get you canceled here. But I think we did have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5147.6s	5147.6	 that discussion. Have that conversation. That's a valid conversation. mRNA is a new technology,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5153.0s	5153.0	 right? Freberg, you should think about it. And we should be cautious. Don't draw me into your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5157.6s	5157.6	 cancel debate. That's why I said we I just changed it to we were talking about that. Don't you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5162.2s	5162.2	 remember that discussion we had? Like, when I asked you, I think, mRNA, what do you think of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5166.3s	5166.3	 versus the regular one, the J&J? I think generally, we've seen science being used as a way as a term
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5176.6s	5176.6	 to discredit what I think would arguably and typically be scientific principles,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5181.6s	5181.6	 which is inquiry, challenging hypotheses, and having, you know, vigorous debate to resolve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5189.0s	5189.0	 to some sort of objective truth. Otherwise, you're having some sort of subjective belief.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5193.4s	5193.4	 And more often than not, we've seen politicians and others grab on to the term science and saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5197.9s	5197.9	 this is science, it says this, when in fact, the process of science is inquiry, and it is to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5204.3s	5204.3	 challenge, you know, again, a hypothesis and what might be kind of a thesis. So, so yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5211.6s	5211.6	 I think generally, this has been a pretty scary time to watch, because it's almost like gaslighting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5217.4s	5217.4	 you know, it's like, hey, you know, you're using the term science to discredit the notion of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5222.2s	5222.2	 science. It's been pretty brutal. I think you guys this this cartoon link, by the way, it's so funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5227.4s	5227.4	 Oh, I just got it old left versus the modern left. It's a Volkswagen bus with a bunch of hippie dippy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5233.6s	5233.6	 flowers. And it says free speech, free love 1971. No CIA screw the establishment resist authority.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5241.1s	5241.1	 And then it shows like a modern SUV. With 2021. It says masks up by heart the CDC obey the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5248.1s	5248.1	 establishment. No free speech. Do what you're told obey basically, you have another poll you want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5253.4s	5253.4	 share sex? Well, yeah, this is a really interesting one. It says a majority of voters 55% say COVID
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5258.9s	5258.9	 should be treated as an endemic disease while a majority of Democrats say it should be continued
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5263.0s	5263.0	 to be treated as an emergency. And then there was a similar poll, the Monmouth poll just came out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5267.9s	5267.9	 where 89% of Republicans 71% of of independence, say that it's time we accept we accept COVID is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5275.2s	5275.2	 here to say we need to get on with our lives only 40% of Democrats. So the reality is that the rest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5281.5s	5281.5	 of the country, I think, has moved on, it's ready to move on. The split is not between Democrats,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5286.8s	5286.8	 Republicans anymore. It's within the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party is now divided
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5292.2s	5292.2	 on this question of whether we should move on as a country past COVID. Half of the Democratic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5297.9s	5297.9	 Party still believes that COVID should be treated as this emergency. Do you think that it's cut by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5302.2s	5302.2	 age? Do you think there's a bias by for sure? For sure. I think yes, absolutely. People are more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5306.6s	5306.6	 scared. Yeah. But I think I think the media and the party they programmed their soldiers to be,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5311.4s	5311.4	 you know, to treat COVID as an emergency, and they can't deprogram them. And this is why I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5315.4s	5315.4	 we're seeing Tucker's Tucker is now the biggest demographic among young Democrats. That's insane
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5321.8s	5321.8	 to me. It's insane. The idea that idea is insane. This does not bode well for the on top of everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5327.0s	5327.0	 else is happening in the country. This is not bode well for the Democrats in November. And then you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5331.4s	5331.4	 had this crazy thing at the, you know, the Magic Johnson party at that. I held my breath. I took a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5339.2s	5339.2	 picture of Magic Johnson. I held my breath. So I wouldn't get the virus with Garcetti and Newsom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5344.4s	5344.4	 It's the new I didn't inhale. Yeah, exactly. And then Newsom says that he was only photographed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5349.3s	5349.3	 at the exact moment where he took off his mask for two seconds. You know, you know what,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5353.3s	5353.3	 if you go to the ski slopes, there is nobody with a mask on and nobody's enforcing it and no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5358.6s	5358.6	 restaurants and this is in democratic country. Everybody has moved on at this point. Everybody's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5362.8s	5362.8	 willing to, it seems to me. Why haven't they? Why haven't, why haven't Newsom and Garcetti?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5367.0s	5367.0	 Because they're virtual signaling and they want to keep power. I don't know. You tell me. That's,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5370.6s	5370.6	 that's, that's the point. Well, I think they're dumb. They should take the position that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5374.6s	5374.6	 reopen. They should just take the reals, but wouldn't take in the reopening position,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5378.6s	5378.6	 get you more voters at this point. People are tired of this. They want to move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5382.6s	5382.6	 It doesn't make any sense. They're making a bad political decision. I think they're beholden to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5385.4s	5385.4	 their base. That's the point is I think, I think the whole country has moved on. Even most Democrats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5390.1s	5390.1	 have moved on, but the democratic base has not moved on. And that is why, you know, Newsom and,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5395.4s	5395.4	 and Garcetti have to pay lip service to this. Well, I mean, and these guys have been telling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5398.6s	5398.6	 everybody, you got to wear a mask, got to wear a mask. And they're not wearing masks. And let's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5401.6s	5401.6	 face it, they weren't wearing masks at the French, French laundry. They have never worn masks. They've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5406.6s	5406.6	 been throwing their own parties with no masks. They're a bunch of hypocrites. The whole lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5410.5s	5410.5	 them. All right. In other news, Xi Jinping and Putin got together and they're apparently besties.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5416.9s	5416.9	 Here's the quote, some actors representing, but the minority on the international scale,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5422.2s	5422.2	 I think that's us, continue to advocate unilateral approaches to addressing international issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5427.4s	5427.4	 and resort to force. They interfere in the internal affairs of other states infringing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5433.5s	5433.5	 their legitimate rights and interest and incite contradictions, differences and confrontation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5439.9s	5439.9	 The statement said, I am willing to work with President Vladimir Putin to plan a blueprint
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5446.1s	5446.1	 and guide the direction of Sino Russian relations under new historical conditions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5452.4s	5452.4	 Mr. Xi said he added that China and Russia should act like big countries as they intensify
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5460.1s	5460.1	 coordination on fighting the coronavirus pandemic, yada, yada. Any feedback from our squad?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5467.5s	5467.5	 I mean, you could have rewritten that press release as you know, we will,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5472.5s	5472.5	 we want to try to destroy us hegemony and replace it with ourselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5476.0s	5476.0	 Mm hmm. This is the beginning of the end of US cultural and economic influence globally,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5482.5s	5482.5	 or dominance, rather influence globally. And I think that it's, you know, something that we've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5488.6s	5488.6	 talked about quite a lot. You know, I mentioned in the prediction episode that I thought that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5493.0s	5493.0	 Putin was going to play a major role this year. And, and, you know, he's clearly not just,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5501.3s	5501.3	 you know, out for his own interests, but he's going to play a really important role in China's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5505.0s	5505.0	 rise to economic and cultural dominance. You agree, Chamath? Is this the sign that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5510.2s	5510.2	 they're going to be running the show? Or does this look like something else to you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5514.2s	5514.2	 No, no, no, I don't think that there's a show to run. I think the point is that there was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5519.2s	5519.2	 a first among equals for the last many decades in the world order where, you know, America was,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5526.2s	5526.2	 it was that first among equals. And I think what they're saying is that it's time for that to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5531.1s	5531.1	 change. And, and, and they're going to tie that to their ability to influence foreign policy in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5539.8s	5539.8	 countries the way that we have historically. So, you know, this is sort of basically putting a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5544.6s	5544.6	 marker on the table that says, this is going to be about, you know, a different cohort of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5551.9s	5551.9	 that are also going to have an equal say. And if you think about where this all plays out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5555.3s	5555.3	 it's always in economics, right? And this is where, again, you have to think about what China
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5560.1s	5560.1	 has done, which is they have while we were fighting wars, you know, putting trillions of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5564.7s	5564.7	 dollars into the Middle East, they took their trillion dollars and bought resources all through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5569.3s	5569.3	 Africa. Yep, right. They built infrastructure, they bought infrastructure all through South America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5575.3s	5575.3	 They put infrastructure all through Southeast Asia, you know, that say call it $15 trillion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5579.8s	5579.8	 that we spent in one direction, they spent another, that's a $30 trillion gap. That's going to create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5585.4s	5585.4	 a resource imbalance that they will use to create even more influence in the future. And we have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5591.0s	5591.0	 figure out a way to counteract that. Sacks, what do you think? Is this a changing moment in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5596.6s	5596.6	 world order? Should we be worried that these two dictators are going to act in unison? And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5602.7s	5602.7	 maybe one gets the Ukraine, one gets Taiwan? Is this like really earth shattering news? Or do you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5609.7s	5609.7	 think it's saber rattling and not that big of a deal? Well, I think it's a dramatic statement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5615.1s	5615.1	 and photo that was was put out. It was a continuation of what we've seen where they have,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5619.9s	5619.9	 you know, Xi and Putin have been getting and Russia and China, they've been getting friendlier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5623.5s	5623.5	 and friendlier. What saddens me and sort of sickens me as really an American patriot who would like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5629.7s	5629.7	 to see the American world order continue is the way that we have blundered and created this this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5637.4s	5637.4	 type of situation. So to Chumas point, first of all, we wasted 20 years trying to do nation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5642.8s	5642.8	 building in the Middle East. We wasted $6 trillion on that. How did China, you know, lose by not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5651.5s	5651.5	 being part of that? They benefited. They were building Belt and Road while we were, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5656.1s	5656.1	 engaged in this foolish interventions in the Middle East. And now more recently with Putin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5661.8s	5661.8	 we've really driven Putin into Xi's arms because we keep threatening to add Ukraine to NATO,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5668.2s	5668.2	 which is not something that's in America's interest. If we would just give up on that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5673.3s	5673.3	 position or just reaffirm that Ukraine should not be admitted to NATO, it would enormously help
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5678.1s	5678.1	 diffuse tensions with Russia. And by the way, your point that these are dictators or natural allies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5683.0s	5683.0	 that's not that's not historically been true. So during the days of the Soviet Union,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5688.2s	5688.2	 you know, you had Nixon and Kissinger make the great opening to Mao and China, and we were able

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5701.8s	5701.8	 a major move in the Cold War that we were able to cultivate Mao and we did so even though he was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5706.7s	5706.7	 dictator with blood on his hands. So Russia and China are not natural allies. We should be doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5714.1s	5714.1	 a better job of not so thoroughly alienating Putin that he is rushing into Xi's arms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5720.7s	5720.7	 That's the blunder I see here. By the way, after this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5724.2s	5724.2	 summit, they're going to meet with Iran. There's a tripartite think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5729.4s	5729.4	 Access of dictators. This is like the Legion of Doom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5732.6s	5732.6	 We need to be playing our cards in a much smarter way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5735.4s	5735.4	 Yeah, we need to play our cards. What is the strategy? I mean, the strategy is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5739.4s	5739.4	 look, we want the American led world order to continue, but we got to be much more selective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5744.5s	5744.5	 about picking and choosing our battles. Yeah, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5749.4s	5749.4	 they were huge mistakes. And now on top of it, what about Ukraine? What's that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5753.7s	5753.7	 Yeah, looking forward, like you keep bringing up the past. What's the look forward strategy in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5757.0s	5757.0	 your mind? The look forward strategy, I think, is to diffuse and deescalate the situation in Ukraine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5761.7s	5761.7	 exactly the way Obama did it, which is to recognize that America does not have a vital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5767.0s	5767.0	 interest the way that Russia does. To reaffirm that the nations of the caucuses that have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5773.7s	5773.7	 border disputes with Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, they are not eligible candidates for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5779.8s	5779.8	 NATO at the present time, kick that can down the road by 10 years. Okay, we talked about that last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5784.8s	5784.8	 episode. Taiwan is a much more complicated situation. I do think we have a vital national
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5788.0s	5788.0	 interest there. Got it. Okay, so two very different situations. I agree with you. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5793.0s	5793.0	 Yeah, I think Taiwan, we have to hold the line. Yeah, we have a responsibility in the United
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5797.0s	5797.0	 States. And I think we're starting to do it. So I think there is good news where, you know, part of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5801.2s	5801.2	 the strategic vital interests for Taiwan is because they have critical resources that we need, and we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5806.2s	5806.2	 depend on and specifically, those are semiconductors. You know, we have now, I think allocated, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5812.1s	5812.1	 50 $100 billion of capital of capex across a bunch of companies that have committed to building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5817.6s	5817.6	 domestic capability. And so we have to make sure we follow through on that, that's successful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5822.8s	5822.8	 And the reason is that it gives us optionality, it allows us to breathe, it allows us to actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5827.1s	5827.1	 make rational decisions and be patient in our decision making. And I think that's going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5831.4s	5831.4	 really important over the next 10 or 20 years. And so we have to invest in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5836.0s	5836.0	 So the solution to all of these things is we cannot be overly dependent on any one country,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5842.4s	5842.4	 any one shipping lane, any one product, any one natural resource, you just can't do that anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5847.7s	5847.7	 We have to be strong at home. And we have to build strong relationships with other countries. And yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5852.4s	5852.4	 I think I think we've got a an operating philosophy here. All right, listen, let's wrap there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUM1mvw17w&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=69&t=5857.3s	5857.3	 We'll see everybody on the next episode for the dictator Chamath Pali Hoppatea, the Sultan of
