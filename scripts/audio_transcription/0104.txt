https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=0.0s	0.0	 sacks, the United States is maybe not going to send weapons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3.7s	3.7	 to Ukraine indefinitely. And they're asking them to sit down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=7.4s	7.4	 and negotiate something that people on the left started to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=11.1s	11.1	 and got got smashed for something you've been pushing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=13.5s	13.5	 for. So I guess mini victory lap for you, sacks. What what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=17.2s	17.2	 the end game here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=18.0s	18.0	 Well, yeah, I mean, I've been talking common sense about this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=20.1s	20.1	 for months to saying that we need to be open to diplomacy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=22.4s	22.4	 because total defeat for Russia also means a maximum risk of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=26.9s	26.9	 nuclear war. I mean, these things go hand in hand. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=29.3s	29.3	 the paradox of this war is that if Russia faces the prospect of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=33.6s	33.6	 a total defeat, that's when they're most likely to escalate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=36.4s	36.4	 this conflict into something much, much worse. So therefore,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=39.4s	39.4	 we need to be open to diplomacy. But it was good to hear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=42.9s	42.9	 administration officials over the past week say things that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=45.9s	45.9	 I've been saying for months and that I've been accused of being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=49.2s	49.2	 like a Putin sympathizer for. So apparently, there's a bunch of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=52.0s	52.0	 Putin sympathizers in the administration. And just to read
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=55.2s	55.2	 you some of these remarks, actually, I want to play like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=57.2s	57.2	 fun game with you guys instead of just Oh, really? Yeah. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=60.6s	60.6	 just mentioning these quotes. I want to get a game called Millie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=65.1s	65.1	 or sacks. So I want you guys to guess, okay, whether it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=69.4s	69.4	 General Millie who said the quote or whether I said the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=71.9s	71.9	 quote. Okay, does that sound like a fair fair game? Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=75.2s	75.2	 Let's put some game show music here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=78.4s	78.4	 Really are sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=80.4s	80.4	 I'm gonna read you like four or five quotes and you guys are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=82.5s	82.5	 gonna say whether it was Millie or sacks who said it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=85.2s	85.2	 First quote who said it General Millie or sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=88.5s	88.5	 One of the lessons that should have been learned from World
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=91.4s	91.4	 War One is that European powers refusal to negotiate compounded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=95.0s	95.0	 the human suffering and led to millions more dead Millie or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=97.7s	97.7	 sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=98.2s	98.2	 Sacks. I'm going sacks. I'm going sacks. It's a very historic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=102.2s	102.2	 Millie said, Oh, come on. Next one. Next one. Go, go, go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=105.3s	105.3	 Okay. A regional war turned into the First World War because all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=109.4s	109.4	 parties made maximalist demands and assumed others were bluffing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=112.8s	112.8	 it can happen again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=114.2s	114.2	 Millie or sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=116.3s	116.3	 You said bluffing that bluffing is a word that you would use.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=118.8s	118.8	 All right. That was sacks. That was sacks. Maximalist. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=121.4s	121.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=121.9s	121.9	 General would never say maximalist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=122.9s	122.9	 Yes. He would never say bluffing. Yeah, go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=125.0s	125.0	 Where there's an opportunity to negotiate when peace can be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=128.0s	128.0	 achieved to seize it. Millie or sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=130.2s	130.2	 Millie. Millie. It's very pithy. It's pithy like Millie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=132.8s	132.8	 All right. That was Millie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=133.6s	133.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=134.2s	134.2	 I'm two and one two and one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=135.6s	135.6	 Me and you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=136.6s	136.6	 I'm two for one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=137.4s	137.4	 It's deeply irresponsible not to try for diplomacy when the stakes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=140.7s	140.7	 are so high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=141.4s	141.4	 Sacks. Sacks. That's an emotional statement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=144.3s	144.3	 I go mille.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=145.3s	145.3	 It was sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=147.6s	147.6	 Damn it. Two and two. Three and one for two months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=149.8s	149.8	 There has to be a mutual recognition that military
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=153.2s	153.2	 victory is probably in the true sense of the word may not be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=155.8s	155.8	 achievable through military means and therefore you need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=158.1s	158.1	 turn to other means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=159.0s	159.0	 That's Millie. It's a word salad. I go Millie word salad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=161.7s	161.7	 Hold on. Hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=163.6s	163.6	 It's a Millie word salad. It's too too convoluted for sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=167.4s	167.4	 Sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=167.9s	167.9	 I go Millie. I go Millie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=168.9s	168.9	 I think it's Millie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=169.7s	169.7	 That's Millie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=170.5s	170.5	 Yeah. Word salad Millie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=172.5s	172.5	 That's it. I caught up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=173.5s	173.5	 Now I'm three and two tied with Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=175.7s	175.7	 Last one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=176.4s	176.4	 Last one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=177.0s	177.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=177.5s	177.5	 It must be our objective now to help achieve a ceasefire and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=180.2s	180.2	 negotiate a peace rather than protract the conflict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=184.2s	184.2	 Wow. It's so formal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=185.6s	185.6	 Millie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=186.3s	186.3	 So formal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=186.9s	186.9	 It feels like somebody said that on the steps of like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=188.9s	188.9	 building outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=190.7s	190.7	 It's very formal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=192.9s	192.9	 It's well spoken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=194.6s	194.6	 It's crisp.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=195.8s	195.8	 Can we hear it one more time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=197.1s	197.1	 May we hear it one more time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=198.6s	198.6	 It must be our objective now to help achieve a ceasefire and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=202.5s	202.5	 negotiate a peace rather than protract the conflict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=205.4s	205.4	 Millie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=206.3s	206.3	 It's a little too formal for a podcast, but in a tweet it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=210.6s	210.6	 wouldn't be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=211.6s	211.6	 So it could be a sacks tweet, but I'm thinking so podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=215.0s	215.0	 I got to go Millie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=215.7s	215.7	 I got to go Millie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=216.6s	216.6	 Sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=217.6s	217.6	 Oh, God damn it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=218.9s	218.9	 Damn it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=219.8s	219.8	 You can't tell Millie from sacks is what we've learned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=223.4s	223.4	 What a great game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=224.9s	224.9	 Right now we're going to play the next game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=226.8s	226.8	 This is called Bernie Madoff or SBF.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=232.4s	232.4	 Bernie Madoff or SBF.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=254.0s	254.0	 All right, everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=254.5s	254.5	 Welcome to the all in pod with us again, the dictator in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=257.8s	257.8	 beautiful purple sweater sweater.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=260.6s	260.6	 Karen, man, it's the fall season.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=263.1s	263.1	 So the trigger will be inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=264.9s	264.9	 The inside of this is swayed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=267.1s	267.1	 Oh, very nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=268.8s	268.8	 Very nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=269.4s	269.4	 So, uh, multiple animals killed for your pleasure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=272.6s	272.6	 Got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=273.7s	273.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=274.9s	274.9	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=275.4s	275.4	 What animal do they kill to make suede?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=277.5s	277.5	 Is that like a type of leather or what is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=279.9s	279.9	 I hope it's an endangered one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=284.7s	284.7	 Well, actually that version of sway that he's wearing is from a white rhino.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=288.2s	288.2	 So they just take the hide and they throw everything else away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=291.1s	291.1	 Oh my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=291.7s	291.7	 So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=296.1s	296.1	 can we take this out of the shed?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=298.0s	298.0	 These are ivory buttons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=303.4s	303.4	 I think it's baby seal fur around the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=307.5s	307.5	 how many baby seals were killed to make your outfit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=310.0s	310.0	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=310.2s	310.2	 Also with us is the Sultan of science, uh, David Freberg racing from the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=314.1s	314.1	 airport.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=314.8s	314.8	 How was that jet blue mint?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=316.2s	316.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=316.4s	316.4	 I heard you upgraded to mint.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=317.9s	317.9	 No comment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=319.6s	319.6	 Well, you don't want to talk about the $1,200 upgrade you did to your jet blue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=322.6s	322.6	 ticket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=322.9s	322.9	 Wait, you don't want to talk about jet blue mint.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=324.8s	324.8	 Why are you embarrassed to fly commercial?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=327.9s	327.9	 What did you eat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=330.4s	330.4	 Are you embarrassed to fly J Cal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=332.3s	332.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=335.4s	335.4	 I'm the president.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=336.2s	336.2	 I'm like, hold on mint coming through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=340.1s	340.1	 Then I start spreading out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=341.6s	341.6	 I think J Cal classes, like the seat by the bathroom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=345.1s	345.1	 In the back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=345.7s	345.7	 Hey, do you think you save 150 bucks each way?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=348.2s	348.2	 What is, is jet blue mint?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=349.3s	349.3	 The name of like jet blue mint is their first class coast to coast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=353.8s	353.8	 It is so delightful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=355.3s	355.3	 They just have figured out a way to make like sleeper seats, you know, that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=360.4s	360.4	 very nice and upgraded service where they, they put like a little wall between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=364.6s	364.6	 you and everybody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=365.6s	365.6	 It's kind of like having a private plane if you didn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=368.0s	368.0	 And, um, sax is here, the whole crew is here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=371.1s	371.1	 Basically, we'll have a surprise, uh, bestie guestie jumping in, in the middle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=375.7s	375.7	 of this, I'm not going to tell you who.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=377.0s	377.0	 Cause nothing's going on this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=378.3s	378.3	 Nothing is going on this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=379.4s	379.4	 I mean, there's so much to talk about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=380.6s	380.6	 Let's just start with the elections.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=383.4s	383.4	 I think we have to start with my mayor, Culpa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=385.6s	385.6	 Usually this is like throwing red meat to sacks, but I mean, at this point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=389.0s	389.0	 all right, so DeSantis won by double digits in Florida.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=391.5s	391.5	 He got a huge amount of the vote, but all the Trump high profile Trump back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=394.9s	394.9	 candidates seem to have lost Dr.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=396.4s	396.4	 Oz, Dan Cox.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=399.3s	399.3	 Just, it was a shellacking, I guess, or the red wave became like a puddle or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=404.9s	404.9	 like an eyedropper or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=407.4s	407.4	 But some of the Trump back candidates did win some of the, um, uh, Peter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=411.2s	411.2	 Teal collection, JD Vance won.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=414.6s	414.6	 So I guess that's a big win for sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=416.5s	416.5	 That wasn't a Trump candidate though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=417.5s	417.5	 Cause if you remember when Trump went to stump for JD Vance, he forgot his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=421.4s	421.4	 name, got his name wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=423.4s	423.4	 So, so anybody that's on your side, you don't need friends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=427.3s	427.3	 Anybody that Trump actually cared about turned out to be just a complete dud and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=431.6s	431.6	 lost and everybody that kind of, you know, had to keep them somewhat around just so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=436.4s	436.4	 that he didn't throw bombs actually did decently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=440.4s	440.4	 But I mean, Trump is a, just a, a weight on the neck of the Republican party and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=445.7s	445.7	 it's time to just get rid of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=448.2s	448.2	 Sacks, what happened to your red wave?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=452.2s	452.2	 Yeah, listen, I got this wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=453.9s	453.9	 Um, I think there's a few reasons for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=456.0s	456.0	 So I think when you get an election wrong, you have to admit it and figure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=459.4s	459.4	 out what you've, what you, what your mistake was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=461.4s	461.4	 Otherwise you're not going to improve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=462.5s	462.5	 I mean, number one, I was looking at, you know, the RCP polling this real clear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=466.4s	466.4	 politics where they take an average of all the different polls, they were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=469.7s	469.7	 adding a factor to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=471.1s	471.1	 They were showing, by the way, plus three or plus four in the Senate for Republicans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=475.4s	475.4	 But they were adding a factor to it based on the underweighting, uh, that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=479.1s	479.1	 pollsters did in the last election cycle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=481.1s	481.1	 And it turns out that the pollsters I think did a pretty decent job correcting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=484.7s	484.7	 their polls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=485.3s	485.3	 And so the RCP overweight turned out to be just basically completely wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=489.8s	489.8	 The other thing that I got wrong was I was looking at the fundamentals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=493.0s	493.0	 I mean, three quarters of Americans think we're on the wrong track
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=496.2s	496.2	 and we're in a recession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=497.3s	497.3	 So based on that, you would think that this would be a great year for Republicans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=502.6s	502.6	 And in fact, the out of power party usually wins in a midterm and Biden's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=507.6s	507.6	 popularity is at historic lows at like 41, 42%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=512.2s	512.2	 So everything was teed up for the Republicans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=515.3s	515.3	 So what went wrong?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=516.4s	516.4	 I think a couple of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=517.4s	517.4	 Number one, two days before the election, Trump basically comes out and pre-announces
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=521.6s	521.6	 that he's running.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=522.6s	522.6	 And you know, this basically plays into the narrative that Biden has already created
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=527.5s	527.5	 that this is a, this is not a referendum on Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=531.0s	531.0	 It's a referendum on democracy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=532.6s	532.6	 And basically Trump made it into a choice election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=535.4s	535.4	 Who do you like better, Biden or Trump?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=537.0s	537.0	 And the fact of the matter is if you look at the exit polling as unpopular as Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=541.2s	541.2	 is Trump is even more unpopular.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=544.1s	544.1	 So that did absolutely nothing to help the Republicans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=547.0s	547.0	 And I think it really hurt them at the margins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=548.9s	548.9	 The other thing that turned out, I think the other big thing that helped
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=551.9s	551.9	 Democrats was Dobbs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=553.9s	553.9	 And I never thought that it wouldn't be a factor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=556.2s	556.2	 But if you looked at the polling before the election, 15% of likely voters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=561.4s	561.4	 said that it was their number one issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=563.0s	563.0	 If you looked at exit polling after the election, it was 28%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=566.7s	566.7	 So Dobbs turned out to be twice as significant as what the early
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=569.4s	569.4	 polling was showing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=570.7s	570.7	 And if you remember, Jason, go back to the episode we did on abortion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=573.9s	573.9	 I said the shrewd play for Republicans here was the Roberts compromise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=578.0s	578.0	 What did Roberts want to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=579.2s	579.2	 He basically was going to allow the 15 week restriction on abortion, but not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=584.3s	584.3	 have the headline of Roe v.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=586.2s	586.2	 Wade overturned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=587.4s	587.4	 And that basically is what DeSantis implemented in Florida.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=591.1s	591.1	 He basically restricted abortion after 15 weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=594.0s	594.0	 It's the purple state compromise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=595.5s	595.5	 It's where I think the purple states and where most of the country is going to end up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=600.0s	600.0	 And the sooner Republicans get their heads wrapped around that fact, the better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=604.0s	604.0	 they're going to be long term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=605.5s	605.5	 To ask you one question there, Sachs, who stacked the Supreme Court deliberately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=610.1s	610.1	 to turn over Roe v.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=610.9s	610.9	 Wade?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=611.2s	611.2	 Listen, I mean, this was a long term priority of Republicans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=616.4s	616.4	 That's not a question, Jake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=617.9s	617.9	 Well, no, we do have to recognize that Trump said he would do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=620.7s	620.7	 He did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=621.1s	621.1	 So this is doubly Trump's fault.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=622.6s	622.6	 Every party nominates justices that align with their values and it cycles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=627.0s	627.0	 Yeah, but Trump said he's going, Trump said he would specifically do it in order to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=631.2s	631.2	 turn over Roe v.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=631.8s	631.8	 Wade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=632.1s	632.1	 I know, but the president doesn't choose who dies in the Supreme Court and when.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=635.6s	635.6	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=636.0s	636.0	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=636.2s	636.2	 There was a...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=637.0s	637.0	 There was...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=637.4s	637.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=637.6s	637.6	 It's also more complicated than that because what this Dobbs decision did is throw the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=641.4s	641.4	 issue back to the states.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=642.8s	642.8	 And the fact of the matter is that now it's up to each of these states to determine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=647.7s	647.7	 where they're going to come out on this issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=649.2s	649.2	 So if you look at, there were ballot initiatives in red states like Kansas and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=653.9s	653.9	 like Kentucky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=655.1s	655.1	 Kentucky rejected a ban.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=656.7s	656.7	 That's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=657.0s	657.0	 That's what I'm saying is there are pro-life ballot initiatives in red states that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=660.6s	660.6	 lost.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=661.2s	661.2	 And so you can see all over the country that the Republicans try to go too far, or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=666.6s	666.6	 they do try to go too far when they try to impose a total ban.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=670.0s	670.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=670.1s	670.1	 What it seems to be popular is this, what I'm saying is the purple state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=674.1s	674.1	 compromise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=674.8s	674.8	 It's what DeSantis did in Florida.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=677.4s	677.4	 It seems like most of the country, we talked about this on that episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=680.4s	680.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=680.7s	680.7	 Most of the country is in the messy middle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=682.7s	682.7	 They want abortion to be safe, legal, rare, and early.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=686.8s	686.8	 They're willing to support it in say the first 15 weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=690.5s	690.5	 But then after that, there needs to be some restrictions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=693.0s	693.0	 That I'm saying most of the country supports that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=695.3s	695.3	 Now it's also the case that Democrats though, are staking out a pretty extreme
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=700.2s	700.2	 position too, because most of the Democrats were taking the position that abortion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=704.1s	704.1	 should be legal up into the ninth month, which is not even, that's more radical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=708.2s	708.2	 than even Roe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=709.0s	709.0	 Roe said that you can restrict it after 23 weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=712.2s	712.2	 So, you know, what we said on that podcast, Jason, was the party that gets the middle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=716.0s	716.0	 first on this issue is the one that's going to do well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=718.8s	718.8	 Not just this issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=720.0s	720.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=720.2s	720.2	 And I think, yes, I think it's true on this and I think it's true on other things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=723.3s	723.3	 So look, I think the Republicans can correct here pretty easily if they listen to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=728.5s	728.5	 folks like DeSantis and Youngkin and Kemp, people who understand that they have,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=734.5s	734.5	 there's a compromise here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=735.9s	735.9	 And the ones who basically insist on pushing a total ban are going to go down in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=740.9s	740.9	 flames.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=741.4s	741.4	 There's a couple of things I think that are worth looking at now that we have all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=745.7s	745.7	 the exit polling and the results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=748.4s	748.4	 The Democrats strategy of helping to promote these extremist MAGA candidates in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=755.6s	755.6	 the primaries turned out to be a huge winning strategy because every single one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=760.6s	760.6	 that they helped put up against the Democrat, the Democrats won.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=764.5s	764.5	 But number two, so what that shows is the extreme right cannot field a winning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=770.1s	770.1	 candidate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=771.2s	771.2	 But on the other side, all of these extreme left leaning Democrats also did not do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=777.0s	777.0	 very well either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=778.4s	778.4	 And so you're back to David, what you said, which is we have been saying for a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=782.2s	782.2	 while, the winning strategy is that messy middle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=785.6s	785.6	 It's the moderate person that kind of like tax to the center.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=789.3s	789.3	 And this is what you see everywhere around the country, all of the battle ballot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=793.8s	793.8	 initiatives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=794.6s	794.6	 Every time you had an extremist ballot initiative, whether it was a complete ban
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=799.0s	799.0	 on abortion in a red state or whether it was a tax the rich policy in a blue state,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=804.6s	804.6	 they failed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=806.2s	806.2	 And so I think the message that you have to take away is the extreme left doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=809.9s	809.9	 work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=810.7s	810.7	 The extreme right doesn't work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=812.6s	812.6	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=812.8s	812.8	 If you look at, for example, like Kathy Hoco almost lost in New York state because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=818.5s	818.5	 of who?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=819.0s	819.0	 Because of like AOC and all of that extremist progressive rank and file of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=823.9s	823.9	 party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=824.3s	824.3	 So people need to really understand and look at the data on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=828.3s	828.3	 If you want to win in 24, you got to be in the middle and you got to clean up all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=831.7s	831.7	 this extremist rhetoric.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=832.8s	832.8	 Freeberg, any thoughts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=834.0s	834.0	 I think the Georgia Senate runoff race that we had in the 2020 election cost the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=842.4s	842.4	 $10 trillion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=843.1s	843.1	 And I think it, because if you'll remember, that was the race that when the Democrats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=848.7s	848.7	 won tipped the power in Senate to the Democrats and all this legislation for the last two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=854.4s	854.4	 years was passed, including a lot of the fiscal stimulus and spending that very likely may
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=861.7s	861.7	 have faced significantly more opposition than could have been faced where the Democrats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=866.9s	866.9	 had the White House and the Senate and the House.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=870.2s	870.2	 And so that single seat and the loss of that seat in the runoff to the Democrat Party,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=876.9s	876.9	 I think ended up allowing a lot of loose behavior over the last two years that's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=883.0s	883.0	 to cost this country for a very long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=885.2s	885.2	 And in part, perhaps we could argue a lot of the inflationary pressure and now the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=890.7s	890.7	 debt load, the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=891.6s	891.6	 debt load increasing by $10 trillion in the last two years since that election, by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=895.0s	895.0	 way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=896.2s	896.2	 And so I think one of the most important things that perhaps people don't cognizantly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=900.8s	900.8	 recognize but feel in some way is that having a balance of power is really important in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=906.2s	906.2	 this country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=907.4s	907.4	 And so to some degree, while there may be issues that folks can argue about, disagree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=911.1s	911.1	 about, there may be candidates that are vile to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=914.0s	914.0	 I think ultimately folks are recognizing the benefit and the value in having a good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=919.9s	919.9	 legislative debate and a good check and balance in this country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=922.8s	922.8	 And so I think there's a lot of what Saks is saying that ties into that kind of emotional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=928.6s	928.6	 conditioning that's probably underway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=929.7s	929.7	 OK, Saks. Trump said he was going to announce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=932.8s	932.8	 He went after DeSantis, called him DeSanctimonious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=935.4s	935.4	 Obviously, the Trump endorsements here didn't help.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=938.8s	938.8	 Roe v.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=939.2s	939.2	 Wade didn't help the situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=942.4s	942.4	 What is going to happen here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=944.0s	944.0	 Is the Republican Party finally going to cut ties because they want to start winning?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=949.3s	949.3	 Or is Trump going to just announce next week and cause massive chaos?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=953.7s	953.7	 What's going to happen in the Republican Party in the coming weeks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=956.6s	956.6	 Because we're 14 months away from Iowa, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=958.5s	958.5	 I mean, this is now the next issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=960.7s	960.7	 The question comes down to do Republicans want to start winning elections?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=964.6s	964.6	 Yes or no. And Freiburg bought up the right point in the last election cycle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=969.0s	969.0	 He's right that the reason why we got 10 trillion dollars of unnecessary spending is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=973.4s	973.4	 because of that Georgia runoff seat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=975.9s	975.9	 We're about to have another one where Purdue won that seat on election night and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=981.0s	981.0	 Warnock won it in the runoff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=982.2s	982.2	 Why did things go against Purdue?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=985.0s	985.0	 Because Trump had a six week hissy fit after the election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=988.6s	988.6	 The Georgia runoff happened on January 5th and then all culminated in the riot on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=992.6s	992.6	 January 6th. So the fact of the matter is Trump has been having this extended hissy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=998.4s	998.4	 fit and living in denial since the loss in 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1001.9s	1001.9	 And as a result of that, we lost the Georgia runoff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1005.1s	1005.1	 I think we did worse than we had to in this midterm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1008.2s	1008.2	 I think we're going to lose the Georgia runoff again if Trump continues with these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1011.6s	1011.6	 antics. And so it really comes down to Republicans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1014.2s	1014.2	 Do you want to win?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1015.9s	1015.9	 And look, I know that there's call it 40 percent of the country passionately loves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1020.2s	1020.2	 Trump. But here's the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1022.4s	1022.4	 He's capped at 40 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1024.5s	1024.5	 Independence and moderate centrist will not give the guy another look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1028.2s	1028.2	 And so you cannot win a major national election in this country with 40 percent of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1032.8s	1032.8	 the vote, no matter how passionate that 40 percent is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1036.0s	1036.0	 You know what 40 percent is?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1037.5s	1037.5	 40 percent is Charlie Crist, the guy who DeSantis beat, who wiped out in Florida.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1043.1s	1043.1	 That was a 60 40 election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1045.2s	1045.2	 That is what a 40 percent of the electorate looks like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1049.0s	1049.0	 Landslide. It's a landslide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1051.6s	1051.6	 Exactly. So the bottom line is that who your messenger is in politics is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1056.9s	1056.9	 incredibly important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1058.6s	1058.6	 And Trump just gives his enemies way too much to work with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1062.1s	1062.1	 Now, if he weren't a Republican, it might be different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1064.4s	1064.4	 Take Fetterman, for example. OK, this guy, Fetterman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1067.4s	1067.4	 OK, he's being portrayed as this man of the people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1070.0s	1070.0	 He's got the goatee and the the tattoos and the hoodie or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1074.2s	1074.2	 Who is he really? He's a trust fund kid who never had a job until his mid 40s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1078.5s	1078.5	 But the press completely gives him a pass on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1080.5s	1080.5	 They would never do that for a Republican.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1082.5s	1082.5	 If Fetterman were a Republican, the press would expose him in two seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1085.6s	1085.6	 Now, that's a complaint.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1087.1s	1087.1	 But the fact of the matter is, Republicans have to accept it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1089.5s	1089.5	 These are the rules of the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1090.8s	1090.8	 If you're a Republican candidate for office, you have to be perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1093.6s	1093.6	 You have to be focused. You have to be disciplined.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1095.5s	1095.5	 You have to be DeSantis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1097.1s	1097.1	 You cannot give your opponents something unnecessary to work with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1100.9s	1100.9	 Every fight DeSantis picks has been a smart fight that he's won.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1105.6s	1105.6	 And same thing with Glenn Youngkin as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1107.2s	1107.2	 He doesn't give his opponents things to work with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1110.4s	1110.4	 And unless Republicans realize that these are the kinds of candidates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1113.0s	1113.0	 we need to nominate in this media environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1115.0s	1115.0	 we're going to keep losing elections.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1117.0s	1117.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1118.2s	1118.2	 Jamath, any final thoughts here as we wrap up election?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1120.8s	1120.8	 I'm going to D.C. next week, doing the rounds high five and back slapping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1125.5s	1125.5	 Yeah. Just to finish the thought, one other quote from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1128.2s	1128.2	 New Hampshire Governor Kristen Nuneau, who's kind of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1130.8s	1130.8	 he's a Republican who's been in spats with Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1133.2s	1133.2	 He said, listen, the message of this election is first fix crazy, then fix policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1140.2s	1140.2	 If you're coming across like you're crazy, their voters will reject you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1145.0s	1145.0	 Now, that doesn't mean you can't stand for principle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1147.6s	1147.6	 Ron DeSantis says that Florida is where woke goes to die.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1151.5s	1151.5	 He says we will fight woke in the boardrooms, we'll fight in the classrooms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1154.6s	1154.6	 This is certainly not a liberal position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1156.3s	1156.3	 These are pretty conservative positions he's taking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1158.4s	1158.4	 But he does it in a calculated, disciplined way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1161.0s	1161.0	 I'll say this right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1162.1s	1162.1	 He is a winning candidate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1166.0s	1166.0	 And the scale of Reagan, if the Democrats also don't figure out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1170.9s	1170.9	 how to clean up their act, because the other message that's so interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1175.0s	1175.0	 that I took away is the legislative agenda that works
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1178.7s	1178.7	 is actually what Biden has always believed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1182.2s	1182.2	 The problem is that Biden seems to get distracted or confused
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1185.9s	1185.9	 or hijacked by the left wing of his party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1188.5s	1188.5	 And they introduced all these unbelievably crazy iterations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1192.4s	1192.4	 of progressive policy that just are not popular, even in blue states.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1196.3s	1196.3	 Just look at the number of bills that failed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1200.4s	1200.4	 So he also has to fix what he's doing, by the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1204.1s	1204.1	 Speaking of things that could fail, the US judge in Texas,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1207.9s	1207.9	 I'm not sure you can tell me if this is legit or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1211.6s	1211.6	 No, they stayed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1212.8s	1212.8	 Well, we should talk about that in the context of the economy, actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1215.4s	1215.4	 That was predictable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1216.4s	1216.4	 That was predictable that the college loan was thrown out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1218.6s	1218.6	 It's completely unconstitutional for a president to spend half a trillion dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1222.0s	1222.0	 without Congress's approval.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1223.5s	1223.5	 Can I build on Jamal's point here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1224.7s	1224.7	 DeSantis won Miami-Dade County, which went for Hillary by 30 points.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1230.3s	1230.3	 He showed that a competent executive, an energetic, youthful operator
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1237.1s	1237.1	 who actually runs the state well, can win over moderates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1241.3s	1241.3	 and independents and Democrats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1242.9s	1242.9	 No, he's a winner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1243.8s	1243.8	 These are the types of candidates that are probably conserved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1245.3s	1245.3	 Yeah. He's a winner. He's a winner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1246.6s	1246.6	 We got a we got a call breaking in here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1250.4s	1250.4	 You know, it's been a big news week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1251.5s	1251.5	 It's not just the elections.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1252.6s	1252.6	 FTX crypto exchange went belly up and we thought, well, let's bring somebody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1257.3s	1257.3	 who's super credible in crypto.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1258.7s	1258.7	 And that's friend of the pod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1260.5s	1260.5	 He's credible because he's wearing a tie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1262.1s	1262.1	 Yeah. Hey, Brian Armstrong.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1264.6s	1264.6	 You look fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1265.5s	1265.5	 Yeah. What are you testifying today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1266.8s	1266.8	 I'm doing great.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1271.6s	1271.6	 But, you know, normally I just I just wear the black t-shirt and the hoodie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1276.4s	1276.4	 But, you know, when times like this, I got to go and talk to media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1279.6s	1279.6	 policymakers, regulators, and it's a it's a good time to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1283.2s	1283.2	 you know, spruce up the image.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1284.8s	1284.8	 This is a week to break out the tie. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1287.0s	1287.0	 Hey, listen, men's warehouse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1288.5s	1288.5	 It never looked better. You look great. Thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1290.7s	1290.7	 I see a red tie and I think fiscally responsible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1294.7s	1294.7	 All right. I guess, Brian, just to kick it off,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1298.3s	1298.3	 FTX in spectacular fashion blew up this week and it's pretty gnarly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1303.5s	1303.5	 You run an exchange as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1304.9s	1304.9	 What's your take on what happened with FTX?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1307.2s	1307.2	 And then what is your position in terms of making sure your customers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1311.4s	1311.4	 understand that Coinbase is not going to have a similar fate to all the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1315.0s	1315.0	 exchanges that seem to be blowing up every couple of months?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1317.4s	1317.4	 Yeah. Well, first of all, I mean, I think we were all shocked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1320.8s	1320.8	 that somebody like Sam, who seemingly is so smart and and capable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1326.4s	1326.4	 Ended up in this really the situation where he appears to have done something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1329.8s	1329.8	 quite unethical and illegal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1332.2s	1332.2	 So, you know, my job right now this week has been to go out there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1334.9s	1334.9	 and just help people understand that Coinbase is not like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1338.1s	1338.1	 We've been pursuing a different strategy for the last 10 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1341.2s	1341.2	 We're a public company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1342.6s	1342.6	 We're regulated. Our financial statements are audited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1345.3s	1345.3	 They can show that, you know, customer funds are segregated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1348.2s	1348.2	 They're backed one to one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1349.4s	1349.4	 We're not investing customer assets without their explicit direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1353.6s	1353.6	 And so that's been the first step is just to make sure people understand that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1357.0s	1357.0	 But then after that, we need to kind of think about how we go forward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1360.3s	1360.3	 as an industry here and both take a long term perspective,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1364.0s	1364.0	 make sure the good companies in the space aren't allowing one or two bad actors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1368.2s	1368.2	 to kind of mess it up for everybody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1370.0s	1370.0	 And it feeds into the whole regulatory story, too,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1372.5s	1372.5	 because companies like Coinbase are already regulated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1375.6s	1375.6	 but we're regulated like a traditional financial service business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1378.5s	1378.5	 But we don't have clarity about the crypto specific regulations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1382.1s	1382.1	 like what's a commodity, what's the security?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1384.2s	1384.2	 And that lack of regulatory clarity, I believe, has pushed a lot of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1387.9s	1387.9	 business offshore to these less regulated exchanges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1390.7s	1390.7	 That's part of what caused the blow up today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1393.0s	1393.0	 They were based in the Bahamas, you know, and they just there's not sophisticated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1396.7s	1396.7	 financial regulators overseeing what they were doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1399.0s	1399.0	 Brian, there's a lot to unpack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1401.2s	1401.2	 But. Maybe we can just take a step back and for the uninitiated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1406.5s	1406.5	 or for the person who's only been just following this very superficially,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1410.7s	1410.7	 can you just in a nutshell explain what happened?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1414.3s	1414.3	 Yeah, so my understanding is and again, this is from people I've talked to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1418.4s	1418.4	 and I spoke with Sam and CZ briefly during this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1420.8s	1420.8	 but I didn't get details from them. I got it from other people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1423.5s	1423.5	 You spoke to them this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1424.7s	1424.7	 Yeah, I mean, this was all going down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1426.3s	1426.3	 I mean, I spoke to Sam about, you know, he was trying to raise emergency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1430.2s	1430.2	 financing and things like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1431.6s	1431.6	 And I spoke to CZ about why he was considering buying the asset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1434.7s	1434.7	 I thought it was a bad idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1437.6s	1437.6	 But my understanding of what happened at this point, again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1439.8s	1439.8	 I don't have all the facts. This is just my understanding is that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1443.9s	1443.9	 You know, FTX was in a position where they had this market maker, Alameda,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1448.9s	1448.9	 that was investing in risky things, and that's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1451.0s	1451.0	 Like market makers, hedge funds, they're designed to take more risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1454.6s	1454.6	 It appears at this point that back during the last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1458.2s	1458.2	 shakeup in the crypto industry where, you know, Terraluna and Voyager
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1462.0s	1462.0	 and Celsius and Three Arrows went under, it appears that Alameda
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1466.0s	1466.0	 took a big loss at that time as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1468.5s	1468.5	 They may have even been underwater.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1470.1s	1470.1	 And instead of just saying, hey, you know, this hedge fund is going to blow up, too,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1473.8s	1473.8	 which would have been unfortunate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1475.0s	1475.0	 People would have, you know, Sam would have lost money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1476.8s	1476.8	 It's embarrassing, but it's not illegal for a hedge fund to blow up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1480.2s	1480.2	 It happens with some regularity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1482.4s	1482.4	 Instead of just letting it blow up, it seems like at this point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1485.6s	1485.6	 he took customer funds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1487.4s	1487.4	 Well, you have to explain he also he owns both.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1489.8s	1489.8	 That's for the people that may not understand that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1492.7s	1492.7	 Right. So it's a related party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1494.5s	1494.5	 He owns his own exchange called FTX and he owns his own hedge fund called Alameda,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1498.4s	1498.4	 which operates inside of FTX as well as in other places. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1501.8s	1501.8	 But again, Alameda seems to have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1504.9s	1504.9	 Blown up. Sorry, Brian, back to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1507.3s	1507.3	 Yeah, so it seems they had this solvency issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1510.5s	1510.5	 And instead of just letting it blow up, Sam basically said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1513.8s	1513.8	 hey, we have a bunch of customer assets over here at FTX or he somehow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1517.4s	1517.4	 basically made a loan from FTX into Alameda to try to prop it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1521.9s	1521.9	 I don't know why he did that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1523.4s	1523.4	 I mean, that that's the moment in my mind where he crossed the line
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1526.8s	1526.8	 into probably committing fraud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1528.7s	1528.7	 And I think he probably lied to users, lied to investors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1533.0s	1533.0	 And he went around and tried to bail out these different companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1535.6s	1535.6	 like Voyager and BlockFi and to sort of prop up this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1539.7s	1539.7	 And maybe he thought he could trade his way out of it or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1542.4s	1542.4	 I'm not sure, but that seems to be where the mistake was made.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1546.2s	1546.2	 Brian, can I ask one question,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1547.9s	1547.9	 which I think will help frame the contagion risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1551.6s	1551.6	 set of questions that everyone's having when people have an asset?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1555.2s	1555.2	 We all talk about customer deposits and customer assets held at these exchanges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1560.0s	1560.0	 But those assets and those deposits are very often some form of coin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1564.3s	1564.3	 I have some amount of Bitcoin, some amount of ether, some amount of something else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1568.0s	1568.0	 Is it the case that there is an assumption of total asset value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1573.2s	1573.2	 that's held in a portfolio of coins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1576.9s	1576.9	 that doesn't necessarily match the individual user's accounts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1581.4s	1581.4	 And then when one coin goes down in value, nominally to dollars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1585.4s	1585.4	 that the whole value of the portfolio goes down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1587.4s	1587.4	 And now you can't actually make the customers whole.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1590.2s	1590.2	 So in the statements that have been made by these guys and other exchanges
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1595.0s	1595.0	 that we have enough liquidity to cover customers accounts,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1599.0s	1599.0	 that the assumption might be we have enough liquidity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1601.7s	1601.7	 if you assume the current market price for a whole bunch of different coins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1605.4s	1605.4	 But then if one coin tanks, the total liquidity tanks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1608.5s	1608.5	 and they don't actually have it matched up correctly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1610.3s	1610.3	 because now the customer account value didn't go down as much as the exchange
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1614.4s	1614.4	 as a total asset value. Does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1616.9s	1616.9	 It does. And is that part of the contagion risk that's going on here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1620.0s	1620.0	 Is that they're not matched truly between customer accounts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1623.7s	1623.7	 and the exchanges holding of coins?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1626.3s	1626.3	 So not exactly. OK, so if you're a regulated financial service business,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1631.0s	1631.0	 but you're not a bank,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1632.8s	1632.8	 you know, we're regulated as a trust company, a money transmitter, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1636.5s	1636.5	 You're required to hold customer assets one for one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1639.4s	1639.4	 One for one. Denominated in the asset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1641.6s	1641.6	 So in other words, if you say the customer has one Bitcoin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1644.4s	1644.4	 you have to hold one Bitcoin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1645.9s	1645.9	 If they say they have one hundred dollars, you have to hold one hundred dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1648.6s	1648.6	 And so that's the case with Coinbase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1650.2s	1650.2	 You don't have to take our word for it, by the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1651.8s	1651.8	 You can look at our audited public financial statements as a public company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1655.2s	1655.2	 with an independent, you know, big four accounting firm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1657.4s	1657.4	 who went to go verify all of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1659.2s	1659.2	 And that's what various custodians and exchanges,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1662.1s	1662.1	 that's what they all should be doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1663.9s	1663.9	 If, by the way, if you're regulated as a bank, you can actually go invest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1667.2s	1667.2	 some of those. But there's very strict regulation around that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1669.8s	1669.8	 and capital requirements and whatnot. And we're not a bank.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1672.5s	1672.5	 So we we hold one to one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1674.4s	1674.4	 Now, if you're an investment fund or a hedge fund or or something like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1679.1s	1679.1	 then you can try to take positions in different coins and different assets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1682.9s	1682.9	 and they could go up and they could go down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1684.8s	1684.8	 You know, you may you may lose your investors money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1687.1s	1687.1	 but there's no such thing as the customer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1690.7s	1690.7	 Assets being involved in that, there needs to be clear segregation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1694.0s	1694.0	 of those customer funds and from from what an investment fund would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1697.9s	1697.9	 or corporate funds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1699.2s	1699.2	 And that's where they got in trouble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1700.8s	1700.8	 They basically commingled customer funds with their hedge fund.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1704.2s	1704.2	 Classic front.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1705.1s	1705.1	 Can you explain the contagion, by the way, just so we can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1707.7s	1707.7	 because everyone's been talking about the contagion and understanding what's next.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1710.6s	1710.6	 So that's what I just want to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1711.7s	1711.7	 Yeah, because I think people are going to be asking that a lot this weekend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1714.8s	1714.8	 Yeah, so I do think there's there is some contagion risk here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1718.1s	1718.1	 I think there's other firms that had first of all, there's firms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1721.2s	1721.2	 that had money just sitting in FTX, and that's now going through bankruptcy court.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1724.4s	1724.4	 So that's been bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1725.6s	1725.6	 I mean, MultiCoin came out publicly and said that they had 10 percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1728.4s	1728.4	 of their portfolio sorted on FTX.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1731.1s	1731.1	 There's other firms that Alameda may have had loans with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1735.0s	1735.0	 And those firms are probably struggling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1737.2s	1737.2	 I, you know, I don't want to say who, but we have received
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1740.6s	1740.6	 a couple of inbound calls from other people trying to get emergency financing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1744.4s	1744.4	 There's people who may have just totally different from FTX and Alameda.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1748.2s	1748.2	 They may have just had their own portfolio that they took margin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1751.0s	1751.0	 or leverage on to buy crypto.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1752.6s	1752.6	 And now as the prices have come down a little bit, they're getting stopped out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1756.3s	1756.3	 So that's all been very challenging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1758.8s	1758.8	 And again, just for the sake of clarity, I should say that Coinbase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1762.0s	1762.0	 did not have any material exposure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1763.7s	1763.7	 Alameda FTX or FTG token.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1765.5s	1765.5	 Can we just talk about this issue of customer deposits?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1767.4s	1767.4	 Because this is really the crux of the issue from a legal standpoint, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1771.5s	1771.5	 I mean, I remember when I was doing PayPal like 22 years ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1774.6s	1774.6	 and the company was like six months away from running out of money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1777.1s	1777.1	 I remember the lawyers told us really clearly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1779.8s	1779.8	 you cannot use customer deposits to fund the operating expenses of your business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1783.4s	1783.4	 In other words, if this business ends up going bankrupt,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1786.3s	1786.3	 you'll still have all the customer money there and they'll be able to get it back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1789.6s	1789.6	 And, you know, it was really clear, like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1792.6s	1792.6	 it was really clear, like, hey, if you use customer funds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1795.9s	1795.9	 to pay for the burn of the business, to operate the business,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1799.2s	1799.2	 that is a do not pass, go go directly to jail type offense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1804.1s	1804.1	 And so, like, that's really the heart of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1806.0s	1806.0	 Now, I read in some articles covering this that the way it worked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1810.9s	1810.9	 is that Alameda had a bunch of these FTT or these FTX tokens,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1816.4s	1816.4	 called FTT, and they basically use that as like a marker, as collateral.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1821.9s	1821.9	 So they basically borrowed, what is it, like six billion of customer funds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1827.0s	1827.0	 from FTX, and then they use their own token to then as collateral.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1832.2s	1832.2	 So, yeah, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1833.7s	1833.7	 And then what happened is apparently like CZ got wind of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1837.8s	1837.8	 and he owned a whole bunch of these tokens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1841.1s	1841.1	 and he signaled that he was going to dump it and the price basically went down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1844.4s	1844.4	 And so now all of a sudden, the collateral for the customer loans was insufficient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1848.9s	1848.9	 And then there was a run on the bank.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1850.2s	1850.2	 And by the way, this has happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1851.7s	1851.7	 This happens in the public markets a lot as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1854.0s	1854.0	 So like when you see heavily shorted names
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1856.5s	1856.5	 or when you know that certain hedge funds are on the brink,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1859.1s	1859.1	 other hedge funds will go in and essentially force.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1863.3s	1863.3	 A margin call and a stop out, because then it's what causes all of these runs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1866.9s	1866.9	 And if you look actually inside a GameStop,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1869.6s	1869.6	 the reason why you got all this gamification in the GameStop equity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1872.7s	1872.7	 and a bunch of these other names was in part because of this dynamic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1875.8s	1875.8	 folks that are highly levered,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1878.4s	1878.4	 folks that don't have the right matching of risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1881.8s	1881.8	 And what happens is they're solvent, but a liquid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1886.9s	1886.9	 And then if you run the instrument into the ground,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1890.8s	1890.8	 they both become insolvent and illiquid all at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1894.5s	1894.5	 And the whole thing explodes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1896.5s	1896.5	 So, Brian, the question is, now that we know what happened,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1899.7s	1899.7	 which is all of these crazy interparty related transactions and,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1904.0s	1904.0	 you know, all of this stuff seems very illegal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1907.4s	1907.4	 There was a bankruptcy filing today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1910.3s	1910.3	 And up until today, it seemed like this issue was really about FTX
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1916.0s	1916.0	 International and Alameda, and it didn't touch FTX US,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1921.0s	1921.0	 which for a lot, a long time, tried to position itself as,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1925.2s	1925.2	 you know, well run and regulated as Coinbase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1927.6s	1927.6	 To be, you know, they tried to say that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1929.9s	1929.9	 But now, if you look inside the Wall Street Journal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1932.1s	1932.1	 all the articles say that this is actually FTX group.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1934.6s	1934.6	 So the whole thing seems to be imperiled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1937.1s	1937.1	 Can you just help us explain that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1938.6s	1938.6	 Because now that's a lot of US people that were following the rules,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1942.7s	1942.7	 thinking that this thing was matched one to one that may be also affected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1946.6s	1946.6	 Yeah. So, look, I don't know who inside FTX is and its orbit of companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1952.5s	1952.5	 actually knew that the fraud had been taking place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1955.7s	1955.7	 I it would not surprise me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1958.0s	1958.0	 I have no idea, to be honest, but it would not surprise me if FTX US
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1961.9s	1961.9	 people and employees had no idea that this was happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1964.6s	1964.6	 I am imagining if Sam was doing when he started doing this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1967.9s	1967.9	 he probably wanted to keep it to a very small group.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1969.7s	1969.7	 Otherwise, this is the kind of thing that leaks and the whole thing blows up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1973.4s	1973.4	 Now, that being said, I don't necessarily think FTX US
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1977.2s	1977.2	 is worth anything as a business right now because of the brand being so tainted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1981.2s	1981.2	 And there probably was not great separation of these entities in the sense of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1986.6s	1986.6	 you know, like, did they have truly separate boards and beneficial owners
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1990.6s	1990.6	 and governance and it Sam seems to have, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1995.3s	1995.3	 it appears that they did FTX didn't really have a CFO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=1998.2s	1998.2	 or maybe even like a real board or anything like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2001.1s	2001.1	 And so it's hard to imagine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2003.8s	2003.8	 We found on there was an article that appeared that said that the head of compliance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2008.0s	2008.0	 at FTX was also the head of compliance at a poker site called Ultimate Bet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2014.1s	2014.1	 which in the 2010s did this exact thing, apparently some version of this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2018.8s	2018.8	 where they went in and they looked at whole cards of poker players
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2023.1s	2023.1	 and then a few employees inside the business would basically play against these folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2027.0s	2027.0	 knowing what the whole cards were, ran this cheat, stole millions of dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2032.2s	2032.2	 Somehow that person found a way to be head of compliance at FTX.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2035.9s	2035.9	 Yeah. Ten years later, which is incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2038.7s	2038.7	 But back to this question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2039.8s	2039.8	 So so now what happens now is you have the international business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2043.8s	2043.8	 and the US business and Alameda research all rolled up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2046.9s	2046.9	 into this one frozen entity, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2051.2s	2051.2	 With now regulators having to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2053.2s	2053.2	 So do you know what happens in a process like this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2055.1s	2055.1	 Like, is it that the the DOJ and the SEC get priority?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2059.0s	2059.0	 Or is there some international monetary like who who who unwinds all of this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2064.7s	2064.7	 How how do people get their money back, if at all?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2068.7s	2068.7	 Yeah, so I'm not an expert at this, but my high level understanding is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2072.3s	2072.3	 the bankruptcy courts will essentially and I believe they filed bankruptcy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2075.7s	2075.7	 in the US, which is an interesting thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2077.5s	2077.5	 I didn't know why they did that versus Bahamas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2079.5s	2079.5	 But anyway, the bankruptcy court will basically go through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2082.1s	2082.1	 and try to find any assets of value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2083.8s	2083.8	 So, I mean, they must they still have some tokens in value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2087.2s	2087.2	 They have a venture portfolio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2088.9s	2088.9	 They you know, I think Sam owns nine percent of Robin Hood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2092.1s	2092.1	 There's various things that they may own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2094.0s	2094.0	 And then they'll kind of auction those off to various bidders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2096.7s	2096.7	 on distressed assets and then try to distribute those funds to the customers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2100.5s	2100.5	 I don't know the exact process beyond that, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2102.7s	2102.7	 I mean, if you remember, the Madoff wind down took many years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2106.4s	2106.4	 and for years he was trying to find assets and then he found a market, sold them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2110.5s	2110.5	 There's the trustee. I think he's still active.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2113.2s	2113.2	 And then, you know, it's tried to redistribute the funds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2115.4s	2115.4	 Obviously, so many more customers here than there was with Madoff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2117.7s	2117.7	 But it can be a very long and winding process to identify all the assets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2121.8s	2121.8	 then run the market sale process on them, then figure out who gets what first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2126.0s	2126.0	 and then distribute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2126.9s	2126.9	 There was an interesting thing that Larry Summers did, I think, for Bloomberg,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2130.9s	2130.9	 where he was asked whether this was Lehman or Enron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2135.3s	2135.3	 And he said, it seems more like an Enron than it is a Lehman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2139.1s	2139.1	 And Brian, I'm just curious how you think about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2141.5s	2141.5	 Like, is this sort of a fraud perpetuated by a group of executives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2145.2s	2145.2	 to essentially take advantage of a situation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2149.1s	2149.1	 Or do you think that this is more like a Lehman situation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2151.4s	2151.4	 which is a well run business, I guess, that just, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2154.9s	2154.9	 got caught in a liquidity trap?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2158.3s	2158.3	 I think it's my guess is it's a little more like Enron in the sense that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2161.5s	2161.5	 I mean, yes, they were over levered in that kind of thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2163.8s	2163.8	 But the minute that they moved customer funds in some way, shape or form
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2169.0s	2169.0	 to backstop the hedge fund, that that was in my mind, fraud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2173.0s	2173.0	 And, you know, that's more like Enron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2175.0s	2175.0	 Do you think now that we have to open the gates on regulation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2178.0s	2178.0	 like the whole point of crypto in some ways was, you know, trust nobody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2183.5s	2183.5	 And, you know, decentralization is the key.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2186.3s	2186.3	 But here, what we see is a lot of people were tricked into trusting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2190.4s	2190.4	 FTX and having their deposits there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2193.1s	2193.1	 And it was a centralized exchange which caused all these problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2196.3s	2196.3	 So it's like it almost violates the principles of what the whole product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2199.6s	2199.6	 market fit was supposed to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2201.5s	2201.5	 So what what should sort of the observer expect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2205.9s	2205.9	 and what do you expect as a business in terms of how governments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2208.9s	2208.9	 now react to all of this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2211.2s	2211.2	 Yeah, well, I think it's really important to distinguish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2213.8s	2213.8	 between the centralized players and crypto, which are custodians,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2216.9s	2216.9	 exchanges, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2218.2s	2218.2	 Coinbase has a big business there and the decentralized players,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2222.2s	2222.2	 which are self-custodial wallets, DeFi protocols, Web3, that whole world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2227.9s	2227.9	 So the centralized players should be regulated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2232.1s	2232.1	 And today they're regulated already, like kind of traditional financial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2235.2s	2235.2	 service businesses, but they don't have the regulation clear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2239.1s	2239.1	 when it comes to the crypto aspects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2240.6s	2240.6	 So for instance, in the US, we actually don't still have clarity about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2243.9s	2243.9	 what is a commodity, what's a security, which one should CFTC regulator
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2247.9s	2247.9	 versus SEC, that kind of thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2249.7s	2249.7	 And that lack of regulatory clarity and frankly, the climate of regulation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2254.4s	2254.4	 by enforcement, the negative rhetoric from Chair Gensler in particular
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2258.5s	2258.5	 has created this sort of chilling effect in the US that has pushed a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2261.2s	2261.2	 of that centralized actors activity offshore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2264.4s	2264.4	 In fact, 95% of the trading volume in crypto is now outside the United States
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2269.7s	2269.7	 and it's come down a lot since the beginning of this year even.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2272.5s	2272.5	 Now, the decentralized players, self-custodial wallets, DeFi, Web3,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2277.5s	2277.5	 this is where crypto really has an opportunity to make a more fair and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2281.6s	2281.6	 free and transparent system because you can go look at any smart contract
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2285.5s	2285.5	 to see exactly what it's doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2286.8s	2286.8	 Anybody can audit the code.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2288.5s	2288.5	 If you have a self-custodial wallet, you can just trust yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2291.6s	2291.6	 You don't have to trust any other intermediary out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2295.1s	2295.1	 And that's where you get true decentralization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2298.1s	2298.1	 And I think that's actually, now those areas still have a couple of their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2301.7s	2301.7	 own challenges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2302.5s	2302.5	 Sometimes people will lose their password or their phone and they'll lose their own money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2306.3s	2306.3	 So if you're trusting yourself, you still have the, you have to trust,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2309.6s	2309.6	 you know, that you're going to do that piece correctly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2311.3s	2311.3	 But there's a lot of good things we can do there around making social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2314.6s	2314.6	 recovery mechanisms and MPC wallets and things like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2317.2s	2317.2	 We remember just a couple of months ago, Gary Gensler started saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2321.3s	2321.3	 hey, these things are all securities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2323.5s	2323.5	 And you went and visited the SEC a couple of years ago or you tried to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2326.7s	2326.7	 they wouldn't meet with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2327.7s	2327.7	 You were very public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2328.5s	2328.5	 You did a tweet storm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2329.5s	2329.5	 We talked about this on my other pod that, hey, like we want to meet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2332.1s	2332.1	 We want to talk about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2333.8s	2333.8	 Now we're still in a position where the SEC's position is these are all securities,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2338.1s	2338.1	 which means the anything that's trading, it would have to be limited to accredited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2342.2s	2342.2	 investors, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2343.8s	2343.8	 What should the United States do here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2346.0s	2346.0	 And how close are we to getting clarity?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2347.9s	2347.9	 Because I know you're trying to talk to the SEC directly about, can we just get some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2351.8s	2351.8	 clarity here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2353.0s	2353.0	 Can people buy these tokens or not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2354.8s	2354.8	 What is the status of are they tokens?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2357.6s	2357.6	 Are they securities or are they not here in the United States?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2360.5s	2360.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2361.6s	2361.6	 So luckily, since then, we have had a lot of productive dialogue with both the SEC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2365.9s	2365.9	 and the CFTC and Treasury and all kinds of people in Congress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2369.6s	2369.6	 And I do think the US is making some steps in the right direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2373.3s	2373.3	 There was a bill going through Congress recently called the DC CPA or the Stab Now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2377.3s	2377.3	 Bozeman bill, although it's having some challenges now, frankly, due to this FTX blowup,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2381.6s	2381.6	 because SBF was one of the people sort of pushing that bill forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2385.6s	2385.6	 But regardless of that, the sort of system that we should have is there should be a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2390.9s	2390.9	 clear designation between what is a crypto commodity, and that can be regulated by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2395.2s	2395.2	 CFTC and what is a crypto security.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2398.2s	2398.2	 Now, this is one of those legal, by the way, what is also a stable coin and artwork and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2402.5s	2402.5	 other things that are not any of those things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2405.9s	2405.9	 The challenge lies in that there's kind of a fuzzy line between what is a commodity and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2410.6s	2410.6	 what is a security.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2411.5s	2411.5	 And a lot of this law is based around the Howey test, which says a security is an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2417.0s	2417.0	 investment in a common enterprise with an expectation of profit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2421.6s	2421.6	 And so it's basically a point based system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2424.4s	2424.4	 And in the absence of really getting a clear list between the CFTC and the SEC are in this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2428.3s	2428.3	 turf battle, I would love it if they could basically put out a list, get their heads
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2432.6s	2432.6	 together and put out a list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2433.5s	2433.5	 Hey, CFTC is going to do these, SEC is going to do these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2436.4s	2436.4	 A bunch maybe are in the middle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2437.8s	2437.8	 Let's let the courts figure that out or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2440.1s	2440.1	 But that just hasn't happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2441.4s	2441.4	 And it's a missed opportunity in the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2443.6s	2443.6	 So if the Howey test is not perfect, given the dynamic nature of cryptocurrencies and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2448.9s	2448.9	 all the innovation, if Brian Armstrong was going to say, hey, this is in the best interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2453.2s	2453.2	 of Americans balancing some amount of security and safety for people making bets on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2460.0s	2460.0	 currency and allowing innovation, what would you say is the best definition, the best way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2465.6s	2465.6	 for us to regulate crypto coins?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2469.9s	2469.9	 Putting NFTs aside, putting down side just specifically, hold on, let me just tweak your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2474.4s	2474.4	 question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2475.1s	2475.1	 Sure, build on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2476.0s	2476.0	 Because we should switch to SPF as well and just talk about the person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2479.4s	2479.4	 But to me, it seems the whole issue if you come back, like what is the first string that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2483.2s	2483.2	 you pulled that unraveled the sweater was the fact that these tokens were created out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2488.0s	2488.0	 of thin air.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2489.1s	2489.1	 They had no meaningful value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2490.8s	2490.8	 Somebody prescribed a value and all of a sudden, everybody else in the economy all of a sudden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2495.6s	2495.6	 said, yeah, I'll take that as collateral.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2497.4s	2497.4	 You look you cannot do that in the regular world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2499.7s	2499.7	 I can't call JP Morgan and say I've invented this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2503.1s	2503.1	 It's called a share in XYZ.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2505.6s	2505.6	 And I'd like you to margin loan, you know, give me a loan against it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2508.9s	2508.9	 So Brian explained like there's a ton of these tokens that have been engineered, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2513.6s	2513.6	 And there's been a ton of these tokens that have been sold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2516.2s	2516.2	 So what should people do that own these things thinking that there was going to be some safety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2522.9s	2522.9	 or value or, you know, like how do you think about all of these tokens that are that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2527.6s	2527.6	 could be as basically as as fragile and shitty and worthless as FTT?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2534.0s	2534.0	 Yeah, well, there there is this concept of like an exchange token and there's a couple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2537.6s	2537.6	 other firms out there that have them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2539.2s	2539.2	 That's something we haven't done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2540.4s	2540.4	 And I think I think you're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2542.0s	2542.0	 Like the actual utility of those things is a little questionable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2545.8s	2545.8	 And so if someone's going to sort of mark those up on a low supply and then a low float
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2551.5s	2551.5	 and then somehow levers that that that's going to get yourself into trouble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2555.0s	2555.0	 But look, I don't want to throw out the entire concept of people creating tokens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2558.2s	2558.2	 I think there's actually a lot of good stuff there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2560.7s	2560.7	 And it comes down to this idea of if you're trying to raise money for your company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2565.4s	2565.4	 and a token through a token, that's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2567.7s	2567.7	 That should be a security and there should be a regulated way to do that in the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2571.8s	2571.8	 Like go register it with the SEC, you know, let it trade on broker dealers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2576.3s	2576.3	 That's that's what we've been wanting to do for a long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2578.6s	2578.6	 And the SEC is taking their time getting there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2580.6s	2580.6	 They don't, you know, to be honest, he doesn't seem that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2583.6s	2583.6	 excited about the idea of this whole industry existing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2586.8s	2586.8	 And so anyway, but it should it should exist and it should be happening in a regulated way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2590.4s	2590.4	 So if people want to issue a token that's raising money for a company, let's regulate it as a security.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2594.8s	2594.8	 If they want to issue a token that's truly on a decentralized protocol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2598.8s	2598.8	 or has some other purpose like voting in a DAO or rewards or something like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2604.0s	2604.0	 then that's probably not a security.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2605.6s	2605.6	 And let's be honest about that and allow those things to trade in a different environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2609.6s	2609.6	 a different regulator under the CFTC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2612.3s	2612.3	 We're probably running out of time with you because you said you had a hard stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2614.8s	2614.8	 So let's ask the million dollar question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2616.7s	2616.7	 Tell us about SPF.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2618.0s	2618.0	 Like what's who is this character?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2621.1s	2621.1	 When did you first suspect?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2622.4s	2622.4	 Yeah, what's your read on the psychology?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2624.1s	2624.1	 This wasn't legit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2625.2s	2625.2	 Do you think that it was his altruistic intent that allowed himself to convince himself to do this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2630.9s	2630.9	 Or do you think this was like malicious the whole way?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2633.4s	2633.4	 Or what's your sense of the guy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2636.1s	2636.1	 So again, I'm speculating here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2637.3s	2637.3	 I mean, I've spent time with I've met him a bunch of times and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2641.0s	2641.0	 I have to say I did not see this coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2644.2s	2644.2	 He appeared to me to be a very bright, credible, competent person, perhaps a bit young, perhaps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2651.6s	2651.6	 a bit reckless at times, but not unethical and not committing fraud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2656.6s	2656.6	 I definitely did not see that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2658.7s	2658.7	 If I look back to see, were there any warning signs that I should have thought twice about it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2663.7s	2663.7	 One of the things I noticed was that in 2021, Coinbase had a good year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2668.5s	2668.5	 We did seven billion in revenue, four billion of positive EBITDA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2671.7s	2671.7	 We became public as a company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2673.6s	2673.6	 At that time, FTX did about one billion in revenue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2677.0s	2677.0	 I knew how much money we had for our venture budget and just like different investments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2681.9s	2681.9	 we wanted to make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2682.9s	2682.9	 I knew their revenue and I had to scratch my head a bunch of times and I was like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2686.8s	2686.8	 where is this guy getting all this liquidity?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2689.0s	2689.0	 Because he was like buying 9% of Robinhood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2691.6s	2691.6	 He was putting like a billion dollars into this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2693.4s	2693.4	 He was donating to all these politicians.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2695.9s	2695.9	 And I was like, it did not make sense to me where he was getting all this cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2699.6s	2699.6	 People just kept telling me, oh, his market maker Alameda is just printing cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2703.4s	2703.4	 I guess like, okay, I guess, you know, it seems like a conflict of interest to own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2706.8s	2706.8	 an exchange to market maker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2707.8s	2707.8	 That's why we haven't done it, but more power to him, I guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2710.8s	2710.8	 And so I was surprised I didn't speak up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2714.0s	2714.0	 I cannot, I can't explain the psychology of it at this point, whether he's a pathological liar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2719.2s	2719.2	 or if he's started off good and somehow under the pressure of this whole thing went bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2724.5s	2724.5	 But the minute you can go watch the interviews, he's lying to people about why he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2732.3s	2732.3	 bailing out Voyager and BlockFi and he knew at that time that most likely he knew at that time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2738.8s	2738.8	 that they were not solvent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2739.8s	2739.8	 Alameda was not solvent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2740.8s	2740.8	 And so that's where he crossed a major line in my book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2744.0s	2744.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2744.7s	2744.7	 We see it time and time again, Elizabeth Holmes, Bernie Madoff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2747.7s	2747.7	 I mean, once the lie gets too big, you can't get out of it anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2751.3s	2751.3	 If that's the case, really incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2754.1s	2754.1	 And the most important thing at this point, Brian, is that the United States makes a decision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2759.8s	2759.8	 on do we want to be in crypto?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2761.8s	2761.8	 Do we want to have a say in this and create a regulatory framework that entrepreneurs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2765.9s	2765.9	 like yourself can deal with?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2767.3s	2767.3	 That is the most important thing to happen in the next year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2770.1s	2770.1	 But you're saying the SEC is not motivated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2772.6s	2772.6	 I guess, why are they not motivated?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2774.2s	2774.2	 They're just CYA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2775.2s	2775.2	 Why are they motivated now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2776.7s	2776.7	 This is a political issue now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2778.0s	2778.0	 So they will be very moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2779.7s	2779.7	 Answers here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2780.3s	2780.3	 What do you find out?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2781.5s	2781.5	 Who did SPF give all this money to?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2783.4s	2783.4	 Because he was touted as one of the future biggest donors to the Democratic Party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2787.3s	2787.3	 Democratic Party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2787.9s	2787.9	 If you want signals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2788.8s	2788.8	 So if you want signals, I would say there's pretty big signals here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2792.5s	2792.5	 Number one, he says he's going to donate a billion dollars to a Democratic Party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2796.3s	2796.3	 And he kept touting this like effective altruism, whatever the saving the world stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2800.7s	2800.7	 Now, why do you need to do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2803.4s	2803.4	 Unless your reputation laundering and trying to buy political protection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2808.0s	2808.0	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2808.3s	2808.3	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2808.8s	2808.8	 You don't think that was a little bit of a signal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2811.6s	2811.6	 Right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2812.5s	2812.5	 I'll tell you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2813.1s	2813.1	 I'll tell you an even more explicit signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2815.4s	2815.4	 We he pitched us in that 17 billion dollar round and I did a zoom with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2821.2s	2821.2	 And after the zoom, I'm like, this doesn't make much sense, but I'll have my team do some work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2825.8s	2825.8	 We did some work and we sent him a two page deck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2828.5s	2828.5	 And we said, here are our recommendations for taking the next step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2833.0s	2833.0	 One was the formation of a board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2835.2s	2835.2	 The second was the creation of dual class doc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2837.5s	2837.5	 The third was some reps and warranties around affiliated transactions and related party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2841.9s	2841.9	 transactions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2842.9s	2842.9	 And the person that worked there called us back and literally I'm not kidding you said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2848.6s	2848.6	 go fuck yourself was, quote unquote, the response to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2852.4s	2852.4	 We're like, OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2853.6s	2853.6	 So that was the easy decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2855.2s	2855.2	 But message receives message received.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2857.8s	2857.8	 But I still thought, OK, I'll just put that in the bucket of these guys are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2861.2s	2861.2	 unbelievably arrogant and smug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2863.5s	2863.5	 But Brian, I thought what you thought, which is maybe it's because they've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2868.0s	2868.0	 created some money making machine in the Bahamas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2870.8s	2870.8	 And so they have that level of confidence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2876.4s	2876.4	 But then to see this thing to the extent of which is now we're only scratching the surface,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2881.8s	2881.8	 guys, that we're going to find stuff every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2884.1s	2884.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2884.4s	2884.4	 The postmortems are going to be crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2886.1s	2886.1	 But Brian, to the question I asked before about the SEC and what should happen, you said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2890.9s	2890.9	 I want to pick up on what you said, which is the SEC doesn't seem motivated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2894.3s	2894.3	 Why is the SEC in your mind not motivated?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2897.4s	2897.4	 I think you're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2898.6s	2898.6	 I hope that they use this as a moment to come together and help local companies in the US
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2904.8s	2904.8	 being built here to end up in a better place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2907.6s	2907.6	 And I do believe David, I think, said it's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2911.3s	2911.3	 It is a political issue at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2913.0s	2913.0	 There's going to be a major impetus to get the clarity here in the US and hopefully to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2918.0s	2918.0	 help build the companies here in the US that are going to serve the rest of the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2921.2s	2921.2	 and in every major financial hub.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2923.1s	2923.1	 So we're committed to building that together with all the regulators around the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2927.5s	2927.5	 And crypto is here to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2929.2s	2929.2	 This is a temporary setback.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2931.1s	2931.1	 But I'm here to keep building and make this thing happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2934.2s	2934.2	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2934.6s	2934.6	 We really appreciate you taking the time, Brian.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2936.5s	2936.5	
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2936.5s	2936.5	 David, you want to get the last?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2937.5s	2937.5	 Thank you for being so honest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2938.4s	2938.4	 Well, I was going to say, listen, I mean, story after story here about, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2943.3s	2943.3	 SBF was going to create this billion-dollar philanthropy to save the world, improve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2948.6s	2948.6	 humanity's long-term prospects, number two donor to the entire Democratic Party,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2953.3s	2953.3	 and on and on and on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2954.7s	2954.7	 And like, quite frankly, what this shows is you want to know what effective altruism means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2960.3s	2960.3	 It means that you steal other people's money while bragging about saving the world,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2965.2s	2965.2	 while taking a big chunk for yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2967.3s	2967.3	 That's what it means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2968.3s	2968.3	 There was a research paper in 2011, and this research team looked at drug addicts and drug
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2974.0s	2974.0	 abusers, 4,000 people, and they found that the biggest addicts had the highest intelligence,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2980.5s	2980.5	 that you were twice as likely to become an abuser or an addict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2984.8s	2984.8	 If you were any kind of intelligent, a quintile, but they were measuring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2990.4s	2990.4	 And someone explained this to me at the time, that the smarter you are, the more you can convince
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=2996.5s	2996.5	 yourself that when you're doing bad things, you're actually doing good things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3000.5s	3000.5	 Even if you're doing bad things to yourself or bad things to other people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3003.4s	3003.4	 that you really may actually care about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3005.6s	3005.6	 You can convince yourself that there's some reason to keep doing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3009.1s	3009.1	 He seems like a brilliant guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3011.2s	3011.2	 I think that to some extent, he may actually, I don't know the guy, but he may actually believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3016.1s	3016.1	 that the ends did justify the means, and he thought that he was doing good for the world,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3023.3s	3023.3	 and this was something that had to be done in some way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3026.4s	3026.4	 And, oh, it just got a little bit away from me, but it's still worth doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3030.0s	3030.0	 I think the problem is bigger than FTX, and I'll say the uncomfortable part out loud,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3034.7s	3034.7	 and nobody needs to necessarily comment if you don't want to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3038.8s	3038.8	 But there were an enormous number of venture firms that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3044.0s	3044.0	 hawked their way into just completely doing zero work here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3048.8s	3048.8	 I mean, and the tip of the spear is this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3053.6s	3053.6	 Who's the guy that works at Founders Fund?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3055.2s	3055.2	 Boulgar, Bouljar, Zé Bouljar?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3058.3s	3058.3	 Zé Boulgar?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3059.1s	3059.1	 Delian.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3060.3s	3060.3	 Delian, thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3061.5s	3061.5	 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3062.5s	3062.5	 That tweet that he had where he basically took the snapshot of the Sequoia transcript
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3067.0s	3067.0	 was one of the funniest things that I've ever seen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3069.7s	3069.7	 I mean, this was a $215 million decision, and Sequoia documented it and put it on their own website.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3077.7s	3077.7	 And I think that's an example of something that was happening,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3080.5s	3080.5	 which is people just looked the other way and didn't even want to do the layer of work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3084.1s	3084.1	 Chamath, let me just string together a couple of things we've talked about over the past few
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3088.3s	3088.3	 episodes, and I think you'll agree with this point, but generally speaking, there seems to be a very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3093.4s	3093.4	 heavy lack of governance in investing given the amount of capital and the velocity of capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3098.9s	3098.9	 in Silicon Valley, particularly in private markets of late.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3101.8s	3101.8	 And a lot of the stuff that's been talked about, where last week we talked about super voting shares
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3106.3s	3106.3	 and the founder does whatever they want, and there's no governance and there's no board,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3109.6s	3109.6	 and there's no oversight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3111.1s	3111.1	 And particularly with this FTX situation where clearly there wasn't a board that was getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3116.2s	3116.2	 the necessary information, that had the necessary influence, that had the necessary controls,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3120.8s	3120.8	 the meta conversation, but all of these threads tie together the concept that maybe there's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3126.7s	3126.7	 a lot of governance and not a lot of diligence going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3129.0s	3129.0	 And the amount of money that's flowed into Silicon Valley has allowed a lot of this loosey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3132.8s	3132.8	 loosey behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3133.8s	3133.8	 I agree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3134.1s	3134.1	 And here's the consequence of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3135.5s	3135.5	 Let's thank Brian Armstrong for joining us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3137.5s	3137.5	 I know it was a very busy day and what a great candid, insightful...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3140.6s	3140.6	 Thanks, Brian.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3141.1s	3141.1	 Yeah, great to have you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3141.8s	3141.8	 Thank you, Brian.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3142.9s	3142.9	 Thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3143.4s	3143.4	 Candid and insightful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3144.5s	3144.5	 Finish with Archimath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3146.0s	3146.0	 I just want to say the second uncomfortable thing out loud, which is there was a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3150.1s	3150.1	 venture firms in Silicon Valley in this period of both not doing any work or diligence,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3155.0s	3155.0	 who also took the extra step and actually created classes and would teach teams
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3161.7s	3161.7	 how to create these tokens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3164.2s	3164.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3164.6s	3164.6	 And those artifacts, those video links and artifacts are sometimes on their website.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3169.0s	3169.0	 They're still on YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3170.2s	3170.2	 They're inside of Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3171.7s	3171.7	 And what these folks would do, and we talked about this, the game that they played
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3175.8s	3175.8	 was they would get a team, they would create a token,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3179.4s	3179.4	 they would also buy equity at some crazy valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3183.7s	3183.7	 The equity was locked up, but the tokens were not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3187.4s	3187.4	 And then they would put them on an exchange and sell them to unsuspecting people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3191.4s	3191.4	 and they would be able to dump these tokens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3194.0s	3194.0	 And if you look inside of that trend, what you're going to see, and Brian just mentioned this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3200.4s	3200.4	 those were the sale of securities, except it was done in a completely unregulated way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3206.0s	3206.0	 So if the SEC is really and the DOJ is really going to take this FTT token
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3210.7s	3210.7	 issue seriously, and what happened to FTC, they're going to start to look at a bunch of other tokens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3217.5s	3217.5	 and token sales.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3218.8s	3218.8	 And you're going to end up looking at some very well known venture firms inside of Silicon Valley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3223.6s	3223.6	 This is going to be super gnarly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3225.2s	3225.2	 And we talked about it before on this pod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3227.3s	3227.3	 There are people who knew better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3228.7s	3228.7	 So you get a bunch of kids who are living in the Bahamas in a house and they're,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3232.6s	3232.6	 you know, winging this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3234.4s	3234.4	 That's one level of responsibility and they'll go to jail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3237.6s	3237.6	 But when we talk about venture capital, capital allocators who've been at it for decades
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3241.6s	3241.6	 to Schmitt's point, and they're teaching people how to do this, and they're hiring attorneys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3246.5s	3246.5	 and creating offshore Panama, you know, BVI, whatever, places to put these coins,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3253.2s	3253.2	 and then teaching people how to do it and then flipping them potentially.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3256.4s	3256.4	 This is we're just peeling back the onion on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3259.0s	3259.0	 I have a feeling that this is going to be the turning point in all this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3261.8s	3261.8	 Token guys, let's be honest, is not the only token that has been engineered
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3266.2s	3266.2	 by Silicon Valley venture firms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3268.3s	3268.3	 And it is also not the only token that's gone to zero that was engineered by Silicon Valley venture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3272.7s	3272.7	 firms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3274.3s	3274.3	 Well, I mean, who knows engineered by but yeah, Jason to at the very least Jason, Jason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3280.6s	3280.6	 there's videos today on some of the most well known venture firm sites on how to do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3287.1s	3287.1	 Oh, wow, I'm going to have to see those.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3288.8s	3288.8	 Yeah, so they're basically your point Chamath is they're instructing people on how to do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3294.3s	3294.3	 And that is a level of capability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3296.3s	3296.3	 It's what they did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3299.2s	3299.2	 Can I ask you guys a point of view on just one big macro philosophical question?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3303.7s	3303.7	 I'm obviously not big in the crypto world and haven't been, but so much of the positioning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3308.5s	3308.5	 has been that these networks get decentralized through the cryptographic verification systems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3313.9s	3313.9	 verification systems that obviously enable them to operate effectively and truthfully
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3319.8s	3319.8	 and correctly and without centralized control or manipulation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3323.6s	3323.6	 But ultimately, while these networks themselves may be decentralized,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3328.0s	3328.0	 the user's point of access often ends up being centralized as a point on the network.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3333.6s	3333.6	 And it is that point on the network that accrues the same level of influence, power, control,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3339.1s	3339.1	 and value as what we saw in the prior centralized network model.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3344.5s	3344.5	 We had biology on last year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3347.0s	3347.0	 And I tried to get to this point with him, we had to cut the conversation short,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3351.8s	3351.8	 but I still not heard from anyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3353.3s	3353.3	 And I've spoken with Brian separately about this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3355.9s	3355.9	 And the concept I use is like, look, media, if you put all the YouTube videos on a decentralized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3361.3s	3361.3	 network, and anyone can access them and they're distributed everywhere, you still need to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3365.5s	3365.5	 a really good application.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3366.7s	3366.7	 And whoever makes the best application is going to get all the usage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3369.8s	3369.8	 And then all the users will use that application and that becomes effectively the point of control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3374.8s	3374.8	 and influence and value once again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3376.9s	3376.9	 And so it seems to me like in this case, the exchange was being used as a centralized wallet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3382.5s	3382.5	 Certainly, you can do exchange through the exchange.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3386.4s	3386.4	 But mechanistically, these guys were storing their coins, their cryptocurrency inside of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3392.9s	3392.9	 FTX's wallets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3395.0s	3395.0	 And so FTX had control over their assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3398.2s	3398.2	 And so the network centralized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3399.9s	3399.9	 And so does the decentralized model, it's a question I'd love to just ask you guys in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3404.0s	3404.0	 your point of view on, does this decentralized model actually ever manifest where everyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3408.3s	3408.3	 has their own wallet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3409.1s	3409.1	 And I know there's all these new protocols and these distributed wallets and DeFi things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3412.7s	3412.7	 but I don't know enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3415.0s	3415.0	 Yeah, I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3415.8s	3415.8	 That would be certainly better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3417.2s	3417.2	 But this points out to me, you basically recreated an exchange without a regulator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3421.9s	3421.9	 And of course, someone ripped you off and it blew up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3423.9s	3423.9	 How's it any different than what we had in version 1.0?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3426.9s	3426.9	 And is there really a model where decentralized works or ultimately, because of the network
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3431.4s	3431.4	 effects and the economy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3432.8s	3432.8	 Okay, Chamath, answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3435.1s	3435.1	 We got the question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3437.6s	3437.6	 No, I mean, I don't know the answer to Freebird's question because I don't know this space well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3442.7s	3442.7	 enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3446.4s	3446.4	 My biggest purchase ever was Bitcoin in 2011.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3450.8s	3450.8	 And, you know, I've bought a bunch of these tokens that have massively depreciated in value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3457.6s	3457.6	 I think lots of investors have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3460.2s	3460.2	 You know, I kind of fell into it as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3462.5s	3462.5	 Like I thought, wow, this is incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3464.0s	3464.0	 I get to buy these tokens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3465.0s	3465.0	 They do all of this cool stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3466.1s	3466.1	 They represent all this value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3468.0s	3468.0	 And my experience has been the opposite of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3470.4s	3470.4	 I've lost a lot of money in these things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3473.8s	3473.8	 And so, you know, I really hope that regulators, not just obviously, I hope that regulators do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3479.6s	3479.6	 the best they can to get investors' money back in FTX.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3483.9s	3483.9	 But I really also hope they figure out all these other tokens as well, because you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3489.0s	3489.0	 just rank them in terms of market cap, start at the top and work your way down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3493.4s	3493.4	 And you will see that these were unregulated securities, Jason, that were manufactured and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3498.4s	3498.4	 sold by our brethren.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3502.2s	3502.2	 People who understand the law around accredited investors and the stuff very well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3508.2s	3508.2	 Yeah, they understand implicitly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3510.8s	3510.8	 Yeah. Do you guys think crypto investing is dead?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3514.4s	3514.4	 Or what do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3515.6s	3515.6	 How do you think people think about that risk profile now inside of?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3519.4s	3519.4	 I think investing in the tokens is going to end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3521.7s	3521.7	 Investing in the corporation is going to begin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3523.8s	3523.8	 And any of the tokens are going to be super regulated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3526.4s	3526.4	 Building on what you said, Chamath, about the ultimate bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3529.1s	3529.1	 Is it possible that Alameda, the trading hedge fund, was looking at the FTX data,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3534.4s	3534.4	 which they had insights into?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3536.0s	3536.0	 And essentially, that's the same as seeing the whole cards in the ultimate bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3539.4s	3539.4	 And so they're making their trades based on what they see the consumers are making their trades,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3543.6s	3543.6	 front running their trades or otherwise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3545.4s	3545.4	 That's not illegal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3546.7s	3546.7	 Citadel does this in the regulated market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3548.6s	3548.6	 That's what payment for order flow is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3551.2s	3551.2	 It's the ability to front run retail volume.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3554.4s	3554.4	 And so in dark pools, that is legal by the law in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3560.8s	3560.8	 And that's what allows Citadel and I think Jane Street and Susquehanna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3566.3s	3566.3	 all these folks basically run these dark pool exchanges for regulated securities,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3571.0s	3571.0	 like options and bonds and stocks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3574.5s	3574.5	 And they get this order flow and they front run it by a millisecond and they just take small big.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3579.0s	3579.0	 But they can't print the FTX tokens and otherwise manipulate the market to the level
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3584.5s	3584.5	 that I think SBF could.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3585.7s	3585.7	 I just think that there's these really strict walls and segregation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3591.3s	3591.3	 as you heard Brian talk about, when you have those businesses in these regulated markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3595.4s	3595.4	 The problem here is that this is totally wild west, unregulated wild wild west.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3600.8s	3600.8	 So who knows what's going on really?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3603.6s	3603.6	 And we're pushing the business sacks off of the shores of the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3607.1s	3607.1	 As you said, 95% of this is happening offshore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3609.3s	3609.3	 What do you think should happen regulatory wise sacks in terms of America and competitiveness?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3614.7s	3614.7	 Or do we not need to be competitive in this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3617.4s	3617.4	 No, I think we should be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3618.5s	3618.5	 I mean, what if crypto and DeFi is the future of finance?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3622.1s	3622.1	 It's an important technology that I think we should enable through some sort of constructive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3627.6s	3627.6	 regulatory framework.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3630.4s	3630.4	 I think the regulator should listen to Brian and help him with the appropriate framework.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3634.6s	3634.6	 But to be clear, look, what Sam did is way worse than people going on an exchange and speculating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3640.6s	3640.6	 I mean, look, I think that people who speculated in the buying and selling of these tokens,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3646.6s	3646.6	 they were using it like a casino.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3648.9s	3648.9	 Like that's different than a customer putting their money on FTX and having their money get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3654.4s	3654.4	 stolen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3655.2s	3655.2	 That's a big difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3656.2s	3656.2	 So I think there's levels here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3658.0s	3658.0	 Now, Jamath, to your point about who's minting these tokens, you're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3660.9s	3660.9	 Maybe that's like another category.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3662.7s	3662.7	 But I do think that the reason why this is on a different level is because it wasn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3669.2s	3669.2	 Sam's money to give away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3672.0s	3672.0	 There is such an easy solution to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3673.5s	3673.5	 Hold on, David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3674.3s	3674.3	 I'm just straight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3675.6s	3675.6	 I agree with you on that point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3676.9s	3676.9	 But I think don't underplay when there's an organized process to create an illegal security
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3683.6s	3683.6	 with special rules for them that allows the liquidity for one class of asset and not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3690.9s	3690.9	 liquidity for others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3691.6s	3691.6	 Yeah, you're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3692.0s	3692.0	 So that's a separate bucket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3693.3s	3693.3	 I don't think it's the same as what Sam did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3695.8s	3695.8	 And I don't think it's the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3696.6s	3696.6	 No, I agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3697.1s	3697.1	 I agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3697.4s	3697.4	 No, I'm saying that's something that needs to be looked at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3701.2s	3701.2	 And we need a constructive regulatory framework for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3703.6s	3703.6	 There is such a simple silver bullet for all of this, which is these things need to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3710.3s	3710.3	 there needs to be proper governance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3712.2s	3712.2	 People have to have skin in the game, insurance, people signing off on the taxes boards,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3717.5s	3717.5	 onshore here in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3718.8s	3718.8	 And then we need to have, and I'll keep saying this, a way for Americans to become sophisticated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3724.4s	3724.4	 investors, only 6% of this country fall into the qualified purchaser and accredited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3728.9s	3728.9	 If you want to trade in these things, or you want to trade in NFTs or private companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3734.4s	3734.4	 we should have a driver's license like test, a firearm like test,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3737.7s	3737.7	 and make a sophisticated test and let people opt into it with an education.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3742.9s	3742.9	 The problem is when you have guys like this, it sets that desire back by a decade, if not more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3748.2s	3748.2	 That really sucks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3749.7s	3749.7	 I agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3750.4s	3750.4	 Because every single person inside of Washington right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3755.3s	3755.3	 who's anywhere near this from a regulatory perspective or a policy perspective, is meeting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3759.5s	3759.5	 on Monday morning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3760.7s	3760.7	 And the meeting topic is how do we defend the mom and pop folks that lost money here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3766.3s	3766.3	 That's the only thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3767.5s	3767.5	 So we took this out of, because I remember I texted into the group chat, hey guys, what do we think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3773.8s	3773.8	 the legal ramifications are that drive prosecution?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3777.6s	3777.6	 And one of our friends said, legal ramifications, these are political ramifications, which means
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3783.3s	3783.3	 that this is going to go to the utmost level and it's going to have the most scrutiny,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3787.3s	3787.3	 and they're going to act really quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3789.3s	3789.3	 It is going to drop the hammer instead of having a path to accreditation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3793.2s	3793.2	 I agree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3793.8s	3793.8	 They're going to drop the hammer because their constituents, some grandma and grandpa, or some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3797.5s	3797.5	 people put their college education to some lost everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3800.0s	3800.0	 We just need a test.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3801.7s	3801.7	 Let people prove they're sophisticated and let them participate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3804.2s	3804.2	 Well, first and only if they get a license.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3806.2s	3806.2	 J. Cal, haven't you been a proponent for letting people invest in startups that are just mom and pop?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3811.6s	3811.6	 I'm only allowed to do that with accredited investors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3814.1s	3814.1	 I would like there to be a test.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3815.5s	3815.5	 And I actually teach a course, Angel University, six times a year for charity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3819.2s	3819.2	 I do it for charity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3820.1s	3820.1	 It's a four hour course where you learn about diversification.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3823.7s	3823.7	 You learn about the asset class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3824.9s	3824.9	 You learn about 70, 80% go to zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3826.9s	3826.9	 We teach you about the power law.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3828.4s	3828.4	 I try to teach people about this stuff so that they can participate intelligently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3832.2s	3832.2	 It would be the equivalent for you, Burke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3833.7s	3833.7	 And thank you for asking the question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3835.0s	3835.0	 It would be equivalent if we had a poker test and we had a test and we had a test and we had a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3839.6s	3839.6	 It would be equivalent if we had a poker test and to play in the World Series of poker,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3843.2s	3843.2	 you had to go to a five hour seminar and you had to take a practical test and you had to say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3847.5s	3847.5	 you know, a flush beats a straight and you had to just prove that you had some level of knowledge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3851.8s	3851.8	 of how to play the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3852.8s	3852.8	 It's such an obvious path to removing these problems while staying competitive as a country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3858.7s	3858.7	 And instead, we're letting people do this offshore like CZ with no rules or whatever rules he chooses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3864.8s	3864.8	 It's just infuriating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3865.9s	3865.9	 It's so stupid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3866.6s	3866.6	 Our politicians in Washington are so dumb.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3869.7s	3869.7	 Can I just say something?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3870.7s	3870.7	 I think the challenge is there's always a spectrum of understanding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3874.2s	3874.2	 and you'll always end up seeing the people on the wrong end of the spectrum getting taken
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3878.5s	3878.5	 advantage of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3879.1s	3879.1	 There's this notion of adverse selection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3881.3s	3881.3	 Distributions are not equal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3883.2s	3883.2	 People will end up, you know, kind of opting in to spend money on things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3888.8s	3888.8	 or making investments that they think are good investments, but they're actually getting taken
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3892.0s	3892.0	 advantage of because they're not savvy enough or they miss an important angle or important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3896.5s	3896.5	 perspective about the person or the thing that they're giving their money to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3900.0s	3900.0	 And there will always be some number of those.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3901.5s	3901.5	 And the way that regulation has worked historically is not by first saying, hey, let's figure out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3906.0s	3906.0	 the right way to create a framework for operating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3908.2s	3908.2	 It's that some sort of people got advantage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3910.5s	3910.5	 That story then becomes the regulatory framework.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3912.8s	3912.8	 And that story has repeated itself for 500 years across capital markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3916.5s	3916.5	 We're talking about a multi-layered thing here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3918.0s	3918.0	 We want to see crypto have a framework.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3920.6s	3920.6	 We want it to blossom here in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3923.2s	3923.2	 And then there's multiple level of people who are causing chaos in this ecosystem,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3928.8s	3928.8	 in this very promising technology with their goddamn griffs, whether it's VCs grifting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3933.4s	3933.4	 or SPF or incompetence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3935.8s	3935.8	 We just need to clean this framework up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3938.1s	3938.1	 Sometimes people, I understand in DC listen to this podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3940.9s	3940.9	 If they're listening, it's essential that America be competitive here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3944.4s	3944.4	 It's essential that everybody participate in risk capital and get educated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3948.1s	3948.1	 Let's clean it up and make a framework that allows all Americans to participate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3952.9s	3952.9	 and educates them and then stops these grifters from doing stupid things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3956.8s	3956.8	 If people were educated, that's the first step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3959.9s	3959.9	 And it's the best about the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3962.4s	3962.4	 Sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3962.6s	3962.6	 You want to talk about Facebook with 11,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3964.4s	3964.4	 You want to talk about the market popping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3966.9s	3966.9	 So at the beginning of October, I think what we basically said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3971.2s	3971.2	 kind of generally speaking, is markets up, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3973.6s	3973.6	 Markets went from nibbling to being constructively positive and basically being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3978.0s	3978.0	 positioned long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3979.2s	3979.2	 Here's this really interesting setup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3981.1s	3981.1	 We have a bunch of very positive news that I think we all have to process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3986.4s	3986.4	 First positive news was that inflation ticked down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3989.6s	3989.6	 Now, here's what I'll tell you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3990.6s	3990.6	 There's a caveat here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3991.5s	3991.5	 I talked to a bunch of pretty smart sharps on Wall Street.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3994.8s	3994.8	 And oh, two things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=3996.4s	3996.4	 Number one is they all gave credit to David Sacks and they said Sacks is totally right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4000.7s	4000.7	 Double dip recession is coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4002.4s	4002.4	 But then they said, tell Sacks that we think that these are the sharps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4006.6s	4006.6	 We think that there's a double hump in inflation coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4009.3s	4009.3	 Which means it's coming down to come back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4011.7s	4011.7	 And there's a bunch of reporting vagaries that may cause that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4015.2s	4015.2	 So keep that in the back of your mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4016.7s	4016.7	 But positive news, number one, is inflation ticking down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4022.3s	4022.3	 Number two, Jason, we talked about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4025.2s	4025.2	 A federal judge basically stayed Biden's attempt at giving student loan relief.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4032.4s	4032.4	 Now, that would have been a $500 billion transfer payment from the Fed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4037.8s	4037.8	 It is deflationary to not give that money to people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4040.7s	4040.7	 It's effectively taking stimulus away from folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4043.1s	4043.1	 Number three, it looks like we're headed towards a split government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4047.6s	4047.6	 Which means that we are not probably going to see any more stimulus over the next two years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4053.7s	4053.7	 Number four, Ukraine wins in Curzon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4057.3s	4057.3	 I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4058.9s	4058.9	 Number five, the United States announced a $1 billion stimulus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4064.4s	4064.4	 Number five, the United States announced yesterday through the Wall Street Journal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4070.1s	4070.1	 that they had essentially said no to Ukraine's request for advanced drones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4074.7s	4074.7	 And they said to Ukraine, essentially, you need to go and negotiate an endgame here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4079.6s	4079.6	 And number six, China has started to relax its COVID policies and Xi is pivoting to economy first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4087.1s	4087.1	 So if you took all the way take seven, don't forget seven, Facebook, which would not take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4091.5s	4091.5	 the medicine. They refuse Brad Gerson's letter, cut 11,000 people 48 hours ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4096.8s	4096.8	 I don't think Facebook matters that much, to be honest with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4099.7s	4099.7	 Well, but it matters that big tech is, and they're taking the medicine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4102.8s	4102.8	 No, it matters to us, but it doesn't matter to the economy, to be completely honest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4105.7s	4105.7	 I think it does if people are going to start cutting jobs, but okay, keep going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4109.3s	4109.3	 My point is these seven things are macro level things that affect everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4112.5s	4112.5	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4113.1s	4113.1	 And I think if you take them together, what it says is that, wow, there's the potential for a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4118.6s	4118.6	 great positive developments over the next six or nine months. And I don't think that that was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4122.9s	4122.9	 adequately priced in the market, but here's the problem. And this is why we've been rallying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4128.2s	4128.2	 The problem is that most of this rallying has been because of a bunch of short covering by folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4135.2s	4135.2	 that who were pretty pessimistic and negative after the last few inflation prints. So this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4141.3s	4141.3	 not really net new buying that we saw over the last couple of days. So you take it all together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4147.8s	4147.8	 It's still going to probably trend up a little bit. But then again, we talked about this, Jason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4152.7s	4152.7	 when the VIX gets into the low 20s or the high teens, that's probably the short term top.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4158.3s	4158.3	 And then it turns around and unfortunately we're near the low 20s, high teens. So that's kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4165.0s	4165.0	 my thought on things right now. Okay. Freeburg, you have any thoughts on the inflation print?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4168.4s	4168.4	 Yeah. So I think there's two things, one of which I'll give credit to a guy named Carl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4173.4s	4173.4	 Chu. I hope I pronounced Carl's name right. He's from William Blair. He puts out these excellent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4178.4s	4178.4	 research reports and we used one of his graphics a few weeks ago. So I put it up here and basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4183.5s	4183.5	 he showed that with the NASDAQ move that we saw this week, so you can see this here, he basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4188.7s	4188.7	 tracked the move in the 10 year treasury against the one day move in the NASDAQ. And he said that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4195.8s	4195.8	 it really indicates a unique sentiment shift. Whereas in other times you've seen big moves in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4201.4s	4201.4	 the NASDAQ that weren't really seeing significant moves in the treasury rate on the same trading
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4207.6s	4207.6	 day and that this is such an outlier what happened this week. The only other time that we've seen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4213.3s	4213.3	 anything like it was when the Bank of England issue happened back at the end of September
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4218.0s	4218.0	 in the last 20 times that we've seen this big of a move in the NASDAQ in a single day. And so we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4223.4s	4223.4	 saw a 31 basis point move in 10 year treasuries in a single day at the same time that we saw what,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4228.6s	4228.6	 a seven point move in the NASDAQ. So he said, because you don't normally see the bond market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4233.0s	4233.0	 and the equity market trading this way together, it really speaks to a big shift in sentiment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4237.7s	4237.7	 Now, at the same time- What is that shift in sentiment?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4241.2s	4241.2	 That there is going to be less of a driver for the Fed to raise interest rates at this point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4245.6s	4245.6	 because it seems like the inflation print indicates that inflation is coming under control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4250.6s	4250.6	 faster than what folks had otherwise anticipated. And so there may not be as many rate hikes as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4256.0s	4256.0	 quickly as folks were anticipating, which will benefit equities and the bond market traded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4262.0s	4262.0	 with that perspective as well. Now, the counter narrative, which I just put a tweet by a guy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4267.6s	4267.6	 who I've never heard of before, but someone shared this with me, his name is Gordon Johnson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4271.7s	4271.7	 And he said, the CPI surprise may actually be due to a technical print that within the CPI,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4278.6s	4278.6	 one of the biggest indicators is health insurance cost. And the health insurance cost plunge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4286.4s	4286.4	 by 4% October to September, but healthcare costs didn't actually magically collapse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4293.5s	4293.5	 There was just an accounting difference in how they're shifting, how they're accounting for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4296.7s	4296.7	 healthcare costs that took place during the month. And if you did not, if you assumed that that was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4302.6s	4302.6	 flat month over month, you would end up actually with a 6.7% year over year print, which was higher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4308.9s	4308.9	 than expected. So there is a counter narrative going on in the market. I don't know how significant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4313.3s	4313.3	 this guy is or how much of a voice he has. But I don't know if we're out of the woods yet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4317.7s	4317.7	 but some folks are saying that the market is saying we're feeling a lot better, but there are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4322.2s	4322.2	 still analysts that are indicating that maybe there is still risk to be had ahead of us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4327.0s	4327.0	 Aaron Ross I think the sharps tend to be on that second, second perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4331.2s	4331.2	 Gordon Johnson Yeah. And by the way, I'll say this week,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4332.8s	4332.8	 I heard five and a half points even after that print. So it is where we're going to get to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4336.8s	4336.8	 Aaron Ross I think consensus we have here is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4338.9s	4338.9	 is that we're in the end game now, maybe what two quarters, three quarters, four quarters of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4343.2s	4343.2	 choppiness Chamath, what would your gut tell you if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4346.4s	4346.4	 Chimath I've been telling all of our startups that you need to plan to have money through the first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4352.1s	4352.1	 quarter of 2025. You must. Yeah, absolutely must. And the way that I have cash, the way that I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4361.2s	4361.2	 frame that out to them is nine, yeah, eight or nine quarters of cash, ideally nine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4368.0s	4368.0	 And the reason is that we have all of this positive news in the offing. But the problem is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4374.4s	4374.4	 again, there is still a lot of risk to the downside. We haven't seen David's second dip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4380.9s	4380.9	 in the recession, right? So that double dip is going to be expensive. And again, the sharps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4386.0s	4386.0	 think that inflation will come back at some point in the next six months. That will keep the feds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4392.2s	4392.2	 foot on the gas. Maybe it's two or three more 50 basis point hikes. The point is, Jason, you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4397.5s	4397.5	 be at five and a half. Again, we said this last week, we're going to get to a point that's probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4402.1s	4402.1	 higher than what people expect. That's probably around five and a half. And we'll stay there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4407.2s	4407.2	 longer than people want. That's probably through the middle part of 24. And if you don't prepare
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4414.0s	4414.0	 for that worst case scenario, you're doing yourself a disservice. I think the market can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4418.1s	4418.1	 start to rebound in the second half of 24. But if you're a company, you need to balance and plan for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4424.3s	4424.3	 the first quarter of 25. Because, you know, again, most venture investors are going to want to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4430.2s	4430.2	 six months of data on the ground that things are better before their sentiment changes. Yeah. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4436.1s	4436.1	 we're just starting to see the drawdowns. We're just starting to see the impacts in people's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4441.6s	4441.6	 portfolios that will drive behavior change. I mean, this SPF thing is the tip of the iceberg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4447.7s	4447.7	 in terms of the money at risk. You know, I went in, by the way, I did an analysis, I shared it in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4453.6s	4453.6	 group chat. Hopefully we can show this up. Brad has a little chart, Nick, maybe you can throw up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4459.4s	4459.4	 the historic drawdowns. So for people that care about early stage technology, since 2018, through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4466.8s	4466.8	 2021, and including an estimate for 2022, we have injected $1 trillion into venture capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4479.6s	4479.6	 And if you look at historically how money has been lost in periods like this, and you layer that into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4486.6s	4486.6	 2018 to now, what it basically tells you is about $500 billion of that trillion from 18, 19, 20,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4496.3s	4496.3	 21, and 22 is going to be destroyed. We haven't even started to see that yet. Right. And then if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4503.2s	4503.2	 you factor in another 100 billion or so from older vintages, we're talking about a 600 or 700 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4509.7s	4509.7	 dollar destruction of paid in capital. So there's still for all the good news, there's still a bunch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4517.5s	4517.5	 of these unfortunate pieces of bad news that have to work its way through the system. Yeah. And for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4522.3s	4522.3	 people who are looking at the chart right now, and you can see the charts on Spotify, or if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4527.1s	4527.1	 search for all in on YouTube, we have a video version there. You just take a look at 1997,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4531.4s	4531.4	 the peak TVPI was, you know, seven and a half x seven and a half times, you know, cash on cash money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4536.5s	4536.5	 And what actually got realized was five x, right? So what paper said and what got distributed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4541.5s	4541.5	 were two different things. Anecdotally, what I'm seeing in the startup world, Chamath,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4547.1s	4547.1	 is people are taking the medicine and a lot of people are shutting their companies down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4551.3s	4551.3	 They're giving up on raising money, and then asking me which portfolio company can I get a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4555.8s	4555.8	 job at because I on my personal balance sheet have been you know, taking a 5k draw a month and I had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4562.0s	4562.0	 I have two kids, I need a job, can you get me a job at Amazon or another portfolio company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4568.2s	4568.2	 And a lot of acquirers have started to happen. And so what's happening is the consolidation of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4573.8s	4573.8	 talent, people who would be a great number three or four person, but maybe they weren't suited to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4578.4s	4578.4	 be the number one person are now consolidating into startups. With these layoffs at Meta and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4584.5s	4584.5	 other corporations, we're starting to see very talented people who had peak comp of 300 700k
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4590.4s	4590.4	 a year are going to go to startups or those smaller companies. And that is also positive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4595.6s	4595.6	 more consolidation of talent, stronger companies. Did you guys hear the story yesterday that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4600.6s	4600.6	 Nick, if you could just leave out the name told about his friend, his friend basically makes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4605.6s	4605.6	 $140,000 working for a tech startup, and then also makes $280,000 working for Meta. And so and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4613.0s	4613.0	 he's been working at both of those companies virtually for the last two years, the guy makes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4617.2s	4617.2	 400 $450,000 a year and nobody knows and he says he works about 20 22 hours a week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4623.6s	4623.6	 On both combined, so the 80 hours and remember when we started in startups in the night late
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4628.9s	4628.9	 90s and into the turn of the century. The number of hours that was expected a startup was what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4635.4s	4635.4	 sax when you were at paypal was a week I would say 6060 to 80 was expected baseline 60. Yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4641.5s	4641.5	 baseline 10 hours a day plus coming on the weekend for a couple hours. Yes. Yeah, for sure easily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4648.0s	4648.0	 Probably more early days of Facebook are our executive manager meetings wouldn't start till
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4652.4s	4652.4	 9pm. Yeah, it's this is I think, Elon is going to be a trailblazer in a lot of ways on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4659.4s	4659.4	 Twitter thing. You know, first he did the big headcount reduction, but then he also just this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4663.9s	4663.9	 past week said everyone needs to come to the office. And if you don't come to the office,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4667.6s	4667.6	 you don't come to the office, you have a good excuse if you're an exceptional performer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4670.4s	4670.4	 and you've got a good reason, they don't have to but the baseline is everyone comes to the office.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4676.1s	4676.1	 By the way, just to put this point into focus, Nick, can you just throw up this chart for these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4679.8s	4679.8	 guys to see because I think it's just ridiculous. So this is basically what we're dealing with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4684.8s	4684.8	 which is like if you look at and these are just a couple of examples, but this is Meta, Amazon,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4689.4s	4689.4	 Snowflake, Datadog versus Gilead, Raytheon and Exxon. What is the point of this? The point of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4696.2s	4696.2	 this is just to show you that we have had a massive rotation away from our industry is the point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4702.8s	4702.8	 right? Where normally, the things that we would work on were just so well received by so many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4708.5s	4708.5	 different kinds of investors that unfortunately just isn't the case anymore. And I think it just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4713.6s	4713.6	 goes to show you that the reason why this is happening is because people are hedging their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4718.8s	4718.8	 bets about how long the economic pain lasts. That's why, you know, they'd rather be long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4724.4s	4724.4	 healthcare stocks, you know, industrial defense companies, and oil companies, because at the end
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4730.2s	4730.2	 of the day, they're banking on oil and war and sickness, you know, versus social media and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4737.6s	4737.6	 e commerce and SaaS software. And if we look at this chart, just no matter how good by the way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4741.9s	4741.9	 this is not an indictment on these companies, go watch the prediction episode from last year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4746.1s	4746.1	 I think that was a prediction episode. Yeah, we got you and I nailed it on crypto. We both said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4749.6s	4749.6	 crypto was gonna crater these four horsemen here, Datadog, Meta, Amazon, Snowflake down 23 to 27%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4756.5s	4756.5	 And then the Gilead, Raytheon, Exxon cohort, eight to 28% up. I think Chamath, what this says also is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4764.2s	4764.2	 we don't think your management style and how you're running these businesses is appropriate for this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4769.9s	4769.9	 moment in time. Please consider some austerity measures and some thoughtfulness in how you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4776.5s	4776.5	 treat shareholders. Well, I mean, it's just watching the number, you know, how people are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4783.3s	4783.3	 running companies. I think we took it too far in Silicon Valley, we took it too far, whether it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4788.7s	4788.7	 J Cal, I know that I know it's sort of a pet issue of ours, because we have to deal with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4794.4s	4794.4	 some incredible hubris and arrogance sometimes on the boards of these companies, because folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4798.9s	4798.9	 don't want to listen to reasonable advice and we come off as wet blankets. But that chart,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4804.8s	4804.8	 to be honest, is because of what we explained last week, which is the when rates go up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4812.0s	4812.0	 the value of a dollar that you earn today is just meaningfully more worthwhile than a dollar that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4817.5s	4817.5	 you may earn even two or three years in the future. That's why that chart looks the way that it does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4822.8s	4822.8	 And if you believe that David's forecast of a double dip recession is accurate, which again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4828.4s	4828.4	 most of the sharps do, and then you also layer in this idea that inflation could come back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4835.1s	4835.1	 you have to be really defensively positioned, you know, you can't take a lot of risk, which is why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4839.6s	4839.6	 startups have to expect that if that's the dynamic, and $600 billion is going to get destroyed in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4846.9s	4846.9	 venture capital portfolios, how open are VCs going to be for business, they're probably not going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4853.3s	4853.3	 be that open. And so you have to plan, I think for the middle for the early part of 25.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4860.7s	4860.7	 If Amazon and how do you get incremental dollars in these tech companies, Amazon does a riff,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4866.5s	4866.5	 some austerity measures, they raise prices a little bit if they can, you know, maybe you see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4870.7s	4870.7	 more incremental dollars coming today. And maybe that incentivizes people look what happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4875.8s	4875.8	 We were at $89 for Facebook shares last week tomorrow. When he made the riff 107, he went up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4881.4s	4881.4	 like $1520. What does that tell you? I mean, I think it tells you that a lot of people were short
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4887.5s	4887.5	 going into that, and they were probably cut off side a little bit by the magnitude of it. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4891.5s	4891.5	 that that's good. The the issue that a lot of these companies have even in the face of rifts is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4898.7s	4898.7	 you have to reset expectations now on earnings. And if you do that, the problem is that when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4904.7s	4904.7	 flow that through to what people think the S&P will look like in a year, there's some real issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4911.4s	4911.4	 So this is not free, you know, it's really hard treading. And I just I would I would just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4916.7s	4916.7	 encourage people, it feels wonderful to have a few days of like, it's like a respite in the middle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4921.3s	4921.3	 of a huge storm, right? It feels like we've been getting whipsawed back and forth, and it feels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4925.6s	4925.6	 nice out the wind came out. I would just really encourage people in this moment to reset your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4931.7s	4931.7	 energy, which I think is good. But you got to go back into that office. And you got to find the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4936.4s	4936.4	 money and the wherewithal, I think to last through 24. If possible, it's grind time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4942.6s	4942.6	 Facebook, by the way, 27, 27, at least two years, two years, 24 months. Yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4949.9s	4949.9	 now quarters is the new six quarters. And by the way, you know, the thing that employees need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4954.6s	4954.6	 do now in this moment is to hold the management teams of your companies accountable, because in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4958.9s	4958.9	 those q&a is, hopefully, you're not just glad handing talking about bullshit, you actually go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4964.1s	4964.1	 and ask the question, how much money do we have? What decisions are you going to make to get this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4968.4s	4968.4	 company to be, you know, in a position to survive? That is really what's at stake here for the venture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4974.8s	4974.8	 capital industry is just survival of as many of these companies as possible through these next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4980.5s	4980.5	 two years. The conversation has to shift from like culture and features to like the bottom line,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4987.5s	4987.5	 and grinding it out and just proving it to Wall Street into the investment community that your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4992.1s	4992.1	 business is worthy of investment, as you're saying the dollars today matter. All right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=4996.1s	4996.1	 it's been a crazy week. Thank you to David Friedberg for showing up. Unfortunately,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=5031.2s	5031.2	 Understand. They don't know that we're adding the sass to it. Yeah. So David also is a great

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id7cNqwqt1I&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=18&t=5040.4s	5040.4	 you get sasshole. No, I'm just joking. David's a wonderful person. People are really excited that
