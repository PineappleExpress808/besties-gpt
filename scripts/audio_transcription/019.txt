https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everybody, welcome to the All In Podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=29.9s	29.9	 It was a slow news week, so we decided we'd give you a special episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=34.2s	34.2	 We're going to go around the horn with our special picks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=37.2s	37.2	 We're each going to pick three picks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=38.4s	38.4	 Everybody, we're going to pick our favorite recipe, our favorite new hobby, and our favorite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=43.0s	43.0	 streaming guilty pleasure because there was no news with us today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=47.2s	47.2	 The dictator Chamath Pali, ha ha, Tia, Rain Man, David Sacks with his new track from young
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=53.7s	53.7	 Spielberg just ripping across the charts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=58.2s	58.2	 Again, this time with a track focused on the Rayman himself and the Queen of Quinoa, who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=64.9s	64.9	 everybody says we should upgrade to the King of Quinoa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=67.0s	67.0	 That's so sexist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=69.2s	69.2	 Why is that an upgrade?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=70.3s	70.3	 The Queen of Quinoa is better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=71.5s	71.5	 I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=72.1s	72.1	 People just felt I was being, I don't know how people could say that anointing him as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=79.7s	79.7	 Queen would be derogatory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=81.4s	81.4	 I think these people are not woke and they need to be canceled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=83.7s	83.7	 Jason, here you go again, making a lot of assumptions about people's pronouns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=87.2s	87.2	 Yeah, I'm sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=88.2s	88.2	 They Queen of Quinoa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=91.2s	91.2	 I take no offense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=93.2s	93.2	 I take no offense to your insults to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=95.2s	95.2	 And today I'm having the emotion of excitement and I am ready for the conversation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=100.2s	100.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=101.2s	101.2	 We got the firmware upgraded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=102.2s	102.2	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=103.2s	103.2	 So I think we might as well start with, I don't know if you guys caught this, but there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=108.8s	108.8	 a subreddit called WallStreetBets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=110.8s	110.8	 And what they do on WallStreetBets is they find angles and a thesis and then they bet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=116.8s	116.8	 on a stock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=117.8s	117.8	 The stock they picked for the past couple of months has been GameStop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=121.8s	121.8	 And boy, did they.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=123.8s	123.8	 Jason, hold on a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=125.8s	125.8	 Ram and Jen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=126.8s	126.8	 That's not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=128.8s	128.8	 So I had actually a guy on my team put together two really important documents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=135.4s	135.4	 And I'm just going to read them because it's full of so much interesting shit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=140.4s	140.4	 And then we can talk about where are these documents from that you're saying from the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=145.4s	145.4	 WallStreetBets?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=146.4s	146.4	 No, no, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=147.4s	147.4	 I had a guy go in, one of my team members, one of my colleagues and go and summarize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=151.4s	151.4	 the entire saga from the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=153.4s	153.4	 And then we can talk about the, the corporate scumbags at Robin Hood and other people over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=158.4s	158.4	 So let's, let's do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=159.4s	159.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=161.0s	161.0	 Let's start with the.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=162.0s	162.0	 Read your biased and boring document.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=166.0s	166.0	 Go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=167.0s	167.0	 You're an idiot because you, you just want to defend people because you blindly stumbled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=171.0s	171.0	 into a fucking trade that actually made a little money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=173.0s	173.0	 Lo and behold, you actually invested in a company that literally they got on television
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=178.0s	178.0	 yesterday and they fucking lied to Americans right to their face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=182.0s	182.0	 This is a company that was insolvent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=184.0s	184.0	 And they're going to be like, oh, you know, you're going to be like, oh, you know, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=187.0s	187.0	 know, you're going to be like, oh, you know, you're going to be like, oh, you know, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=190.0s	190.0	 going to be insolvent because now let's just put a pin in the following data point, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=193.8s	193.8	 I believe to be true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=195.2s	195.2	 I know more about this than you do because I live in these markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=199.4s	199.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=200.4s	200.4	 So I understand what it means to be putting on trades, to being short, to being gamma
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=204.0s	204.0	 squeezed, to have longs to do all of this risk management.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=207.2s	207.2	 You're an early stage investor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=208.8s	208.8	 So I know the intricacies of this stuff and what's happening in your this company was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=212.8s	212.8	 insolvent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=213.8s	213.8	 They did not have the capital requirements to post the margin that was being asked of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=219.2s	219.2	 them by their partners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=222.4s	222.4	 And so this was a platform level decision to ban and block people from trading securities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=228.2s	228.2	 It cost individuals hundreds of millions, probably billions, maybe even tens of billions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=233.8s	233.8	 and these motherfuckers should go to jail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=236.6s	236.6	 Now let me give you the timeline before we get into that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=239.8s	239.8	 June, 2019.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=242.3s	242.3	 In June of 2019, a Wall Street bets user named deep fucking value began buying long-dated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=249.3s	249.3	 January 21 calls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=251.2s	251.2	 What that means is in June of 19, this person was betting that the stock would go up by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=256.0s	256.0	 January of 2021.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=258.4s	258.4	 He spent $50,000, which by the way today is worth about $25 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=263.1s	263.1	 By the way, Shabat, we should just highlight that there are forums where individuals that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=267.9s	267.9	 are trading stocks talk to each other and share tips and promote things to one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=272.1s	272.1	 That's where this was taking place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=273.1s	273.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=274.1s	274.1	 And by the way, those forums exist in the professional organized world too amongst hedge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=278.8s	278.8	 funds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=279.8s	279.8	 I've been invited to idea dinners where we all get together and we talk about the ideas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=283.7s	283.7	 that we have and we're all expected to do fundamental analysis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=288.0s	288.0	 But some of those ideas are actually momentum driven ideas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=290.8s	290.8	 And a lot of the biggest dislocations in the market, just as a setup here, have been because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=295.9s	295.9	 of momentum driven trading by organized capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=299.3s	299.3	 So we've been stuck with this for a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=302.2s	302.2	 So this guy, DeepfuckingValue posts this and every month since he's posted a screenshot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=306.5s	306.5	 of his position and he's titled it GME YOLO update.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=311.4s	311.4	 August 22nd of 2019, Michael Burry, who is this guy famous from the big short, who's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=317.9s	317.9	 the guy that caught the mortgage thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=319.8s	319.8	 He discloses a 3% position in the company and he highlights that 90% of GameStop's 5,700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=329.5s	329.5	 members are free cash flow positive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=333.1s	333.1	 That's like pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=335.1s	335.1	 He urges a buyback and he notes that the company was trading at or near net cash levels.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=340.5s	340.5	 So he's making a deep value oriented fundamental thesis as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=344.6s	344.6	 Shama, I think also it's worth saying what GameStop is because even my wife asked me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=348.1s	348.1	 what the hell is GameStop last night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=349.8s	349.8	 GameStop is a retail store where people buy video games.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=352.2s	352.2	 I used to go to the mall all the time and buy video games there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=354.4s	354.4	 And consoles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=355.4s	355.4	 And consoles and headphones and other stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=356.4s	356.4	 And they'll buy back your old games.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=357.8s	357.8	 And so the stock got beat up over the last couple of years as people stopped going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=361.0s	361.0	 malls and stopped buying stuff in stores and everyone thought the company was going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=364.3s	364.3	 die.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=365.3s	365.3	 And so these guys observed that maybe there's real value in this company and it's making
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=368.5s	368.5	 money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=369.5s	369.5	 And digital downloads are now the standard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=371.2s	371.2	 No one buys DVD ROMs anymore or anything like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=374.7s	374.7	 And the Chewy founder, who is very successful at e-commerce, came in to run the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=380.3s	380.3	 I'm about to get there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=381.3s	381.3	 That's the best part of the story.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=400.8s	400.8	 About two or three weeks later on September 19th of last year, a member of Wall Street

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=414.7s	414.7	 So hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=415.7s	415.7	 What does that mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=416.7s	416.7	 120% short interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=418.5s	418.5	 And he defends the company as a result of a few things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=420.9s	420.9	 He says, number one, there's a new console cycle coming, just as Jason mentioned.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=442.0s	442.0	 He predicted the convergence of all these factors would lead to a big squeeze.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=447.0s	447.0	 Now November 16th of 2020, Ryan Cohen writes a letter to the GameStop board and he urges

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=486.4s	486.4	 What does that mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=487.5s	487.5	 That they are synthetically shorting the stock by buying the right to sell it at a different

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=496.6s	496.6	 And that they had been long that position for more than four years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=501.3s	501.3	 So all the way going back to 2016.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=504.3s	504.3	 Fast forward to now 2021 of this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=506.8s	506.8	 January of 2021, GameStop strikes an agreement with Ryan Cohen and adds him to the board

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=526.7s	526.7	 The stock goes up 13% on that day and closes at about 20 bucks a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=531.8s	531.8	 One day later, and then over the next day after that, so for January 12th and 13th of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=539.9s	539.9	 There's a ton of activity around GameStop in Wall Street bets and now in Discord and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=545.7s	545.7	 in stock twits claiming that Ryan Cohen is going to be the savior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=551.1s	551.1	 And then by January 14th, so three days later, the stock closes at 40 bucks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=556.5s	556.5	 So now it's up 125%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=559.9s	559.9	 So now comes the setup, the pros versus the joes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=564.0s	564.0	 From January 12th to today, there has basically been a battle by institutional investors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=569.8s	569.8	 on one side shorting GameStop and retail investors on the other buying the stock and also buying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=578.0s	578.0	 the right to buy the stock or what's called call options.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=580.6s	580.6	 And this is what has created this crazy nonsense we've seen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=585.3s	585.3	 So on the institutional side, after retail drives the stock up, the institutional guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=592.4s	592.4	 are like, Hey, wait a minute, you know, Ryan Cohen's an idiot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=595.9s	595.9	 You know, this company is fucked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=597.9s	597.9	 Fuck these guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=598.9s	598.9	 They have too many, you know, cyclical and secular tailwinds and they become so massively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=604.0s	604.0	 short that the infrastructure that's supposed to even count all the shares can't keep up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=610.0s	610.0	 And now they are short more than the actual number of shares that actually exist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=613.7s	613.7	 So now they're 140% short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=617.6s	617.6	 The joes retail, they start to aggressively purchase all these call options.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=621.9s	621.9	 And on January 13th and 14th, this price keeps ticking up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=627.7s	627.7	 Then a bunch of quant funds and momentum hedge funds notice all this activity and they also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=632.8s	632.8	 participate on the long side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=635.4s	635.4	 And then over the past seven trading days, we have traded over $100 billion of stock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=640.8s	640.8	 in GameStop, which is well in excess of what retail can support.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=644.9s	644.9	 So here's what's crazy to realize a bunch of value oriented, non computerized, non
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=651.5s	651.5	 quantitative hedge funds short retail notices a dislocation initially fundamentally, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=657.5s	657.5	 then momentum oriented buys other hedge funds realize also buy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=663.2s	663.2	 And this is what's created this massive short squeeze on January 19th.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=668.2s	668.2	 Citron research, a research firm that basically tries to, you know, find shorts in the market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=674.5s	674.5	 announces that they were short GameStop and they gave five reasons why it should go to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=678.3s	678.3	 20 bucks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=679.7s	679.7	 The stock was at 3550 on January 19th.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=683.6s	683.6	 Then over the next two days, GameStop calls hit an all time high and it runs a two day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=690.4s	690.4	 rally of almost 70%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=692.4s	692.4	 And this is what really starts what's called a gamma squeeze, okay, which is what we saw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=696.5s	696.5	 in the first part of this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=698.0s	698.0	 So January 25th, Ken Griffin, Stevie Cohen, they inject almost $3 billion into Melvin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=703.5s	703.5	 Capital, the firm that was short, 2 billion from Citadel and 750 from, from Stevie Cohen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=709.9s	709.9	 Stevie Cohen had a billion in it from before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=713.0s	713.0	 And then now all of a sudden the squeeze keeps happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=715.4s	715.4	 The squeeze keeps happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=717.3s	717.3	 And then it starts to spill over to the rest of the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=719.6s	719.6	 Now all these hedge funds, these original hedge funds, they are getting called by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=723.6s	723.6	 bank saying, Hey, wait a minute, you've run over your collateral limits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=727.3s	727.3	 You need to post more collateral.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=728.8s	728.8	 We need more money in your bank accounts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=731.0s	731.0	 So now not only do they have to cover GameStop, they have to cover all their other shorts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=735.5s	735.5	 So those go crazy and they have to sell their longs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=738.7s	738.7	 So now they're selling, you know, Facebook, Netflix, Alibaba.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=742.4s	742.4	 So those things are going down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=744.8s	744.8	 That accordion is what's been happening in the market in the last couple of days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=749.6s	749.6	 And then the coup de grace is what happened on January 28th of 2021.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=754.8s	754.8	 Brokerage firms, and this is where Jason, we should talk about this, like Robinhood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=758.9s	758.9	 and Interactive Brokers, because in fairness, it wasn't just Robinhood, prevented their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=762.9s	762.9	 users from buying GameStop and a handful of other stocks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=766.8s	766.8	 They were only able to sell, which resulted in such a one-way pressure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=771.9s	771.9	 It caused a 44% sell-off yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=775.3s	775.3	 Now that's been reversed today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=778.8s	778.8	 And so what it speaks to is a bunch of questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=780.8s	780.8	 There are questions as to whether or not this was mandated by the platforms or the regulators.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=786.3s	786.3	 Given the fact that it didn't impact all the brokerage accounts, it was a platform-level
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=791.4s	791.4	 decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=793.0s	793.0	 So some organizations like Robinhood banned it, some organizations did not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=799.6s	799.6	 And it could be that some of these platforms that banned it is likely because, and this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=805.0s	805.0	 is where we get to the insolvency question, didn't have enough margin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=809.6s	809.6	 And so they knew that if they opened the doors, there would be a run on the bank and there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=813.7s	813.7	 would be a run on Robinhood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=815.6s	815.6	 And that's why they basically, I believe, had to stop allowing people to trade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=821.2s	821.2	 And it just shows how fragile the whole system is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=826.8s	826.8	 The last thing I'll say and then we can talk about this is how does Robinhood make money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=830.7s	830.7	 which I think is also important to understand in this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=833.0s	833.0	 Robinhood makes money through a mechanism that's called payment for order flow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=839.1s	839.1	 So they don't make money from consumers, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=842.1s	842.1	 What they do is they watch and monitor your orders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=846.6s	846.6	 They create a data file about that and they give it to these prime brokerage institutions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=854.2s	854.2	 like Citadel milliseconds before you do the trade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=858.3s	858.3	 What that allows Citadel to do is if they see a lot of people buying, milliseconds before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=863.3s	863.3	 you buy, they can buy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=865.7s	865.7	 And that allows them to make money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=867.4s	867.4	 So to be clear, Citadel is responsible for 47% of all the payment for order flow volume.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=875.6s	875.6	 They paid Robinhood almost $60 million in the third quarter, plus another, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=883.8s	883.8	 seven and a half million for S&P 500 stocks and 31 million for non-S&P 500 stocks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=888.8s	888.8	 They paid them almost $100 million in the quarter or a $400 million run rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=893.6s	893.6	 So if we had to summarize all of this in a nutshell, that's what we know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=897.7s	897.7	 We know that it started out as people debating the true fundamental value of GameStop and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=906.3s	906.3	 it morphed into a momentum trade where a bunch of folks got dogmatic about a short, a bunch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=913.4s	913.4	 of folks got dogmatic about being long and belongs one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=918.2s	918.2	 And in the middle, what happened was a bunch of firms basically decided at some point to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=923.9s	923.9	 gate the ability for people to transact in all of this, which I think caused a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=928.9s	928.9	 economic disruption.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=930.3s	930.3	 And that was because they didn't have the margin requirements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=932.2s	932.2	 And I think it's because they were insolvent, i.e. Robinhood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=936.3s	936.3	 Jason, over to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=939.4s	939.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=940.4s	940.4	 I think we probably agree on a lot of things here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=944.2s	944.2	 Thank you for the concise overview.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=945.2s	945.2	 We agree that Wall Street bets and retail investors are incredibly powerful now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=952.9s	952.9	 And we agree that that's a good thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=954.8s	954.8	 We also probably agree that there are shenanigans going on with shorting of stocks, i.e. 120%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=960.4s	960.4	 or 130% short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=962.2s	962.2	 And we agree, I think, that some of these hedge funds do manipulate the markets with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=967.7s	967.7	 these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=968.7s	968.7	 We also agree that it's unfortunate that in order to stay solvent, Robinhood, apparently,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=974.9s	974.9	 if this is the information, we don't have complete information right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=978.1s	978.1	 So the thing I do think that you're being tremendously unfair about, and I'll try not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=981.6s	981.6	 to make it personal, Chamath, is that you've been uncouth and you're attacking people without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=985.8s	985.8	 with partial information.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=987.2s	987.2	 I'll let you respond to that in a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=989.2s	989.2	 And I think we agree that Robinhood is responsible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=993.7s	993.7	 Robinhood is responsible for this revolution in retail trading.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=997.8s	997.8	 They created the platform and they created the innovation that got millennials to en masse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1004.4s	1004.4	 embrace trading stocks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1005.5s	1005.5	 How did they do it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1006.6s	1006.6	 They figured out a clever innovation of how to make it free and friction free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1010.8s	1010.8	 They did that because they did this selling of the data and the order flow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1014.5s	1014.5	 Okay, we can debate whether that is fair or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1018.1s	1018.1	 But Facebook did the same thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1020.7s	1020.7	 They created a data business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1022.2s	1022.2	 They provided amazing products and services that you yourself built for five years and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1025.8s	1025.8	 made a billion dollars off of in order to make it free for consumers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1030.5s	1030.5	 Now, there are unintended consequences of any company at scale, whether it's Uber,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1035.6s	1035.6	 Robinhood, Tesla, etc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1037.8s	1037.8	 And they will all have to weather these storms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1039.8s	1039.8	 And I think that there are pieces of information that you do not have, Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1044.5s	1044.5	 And for you to say that they're criminal and for you to say they're scumbags and to act
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1048.2s	1048.2	 this way is, I think, unprofessional and does you a disservice and does your argument a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1053.1s	1053.1	 disservice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1054.1s	1054.1	 And you did this as well with Uber, another one of my investments, and that company weathered
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1057.2s	1057.2	 the storm and they've done great things in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1060.0s	1060.0	 And I'm very proud of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1061.0s	1061.0	 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1062.0s	1062.0	 And I will be very proud of what I believe that Uber fired their CEO and they brought
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1066.6s	1066.6	 in Dara who cleaned it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1068.2s	1068.2	 Oh, agreed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1069.2s	1069.2	 Agreed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1070.2s	1070.2	 But they got there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1071.2s	1071.2	 And so I believe what happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1073.3s	1073.3	 So what do you know that I don't know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1075.2s	1075.2	 Well, I haven't talked to Vlad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1077.9s	1077.9	 I saw what he said about Vlad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1079.4s	1079.4	 He lied on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1080.4s	1080.4	 He lied on television.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1081.4s	1081.4	 I don't believe you lied.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1082.4s	1082.4	 I like it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1083.4s	1083.4	 It's very light on Fox.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1084.4s	1084.4	 Where did he know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1085.4s	1085.4	 What is the lie?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1086.4s	1086.4	 Well, Jason, Jason was confronted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1088.6s	1088.6	 He was confronted about whether there was a liquidity crisis and he said to their face,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1093.2s	1093.2	 no, that is not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1095.4s	1095.4	 I think this is being misinterpreted and there'll be a clarification that'll car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1100.6s	1100.6	 I think because they were able to draw down 600 million and because they were able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1106.1s	1106.1	 take down a billion dollar investment from the top investors in the world that they resolved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1112.2s	1112.2	 their liquidity problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1115.3s	1115.3	 has ever created this many retail investors than Robin Hood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1119.6s	1119.6	 They are responsible for the movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1122.5s	1122.5	 When they pitched me the company, they wanted to create this revolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1126.6s	1126.6	 It is paradoxical that they are now the enemies of the revolution because they actually created
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1132.9s	1132.9	 and enabled this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1134.3s	1134.3	 And I, and they have been number one in the app store since this whole fiasco starting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1139.7s	1139.7	 nothing you're saying convinces me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1141.4s	1141.4	 This is the, they are the Lehman brothers or Bear Stearns of 2008 to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1146.3s	1146.3	 They will not be, they will get through this and there has, this is an unprecedented black
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1150.8s	1150.8	 swan event.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1151.8s	1151.8	 I think we would all agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1152.8s	1152.8	 Nobody has ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1153.8s	1153.8	 That's exactly what Lehman and Bear said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1156.7s	1156.7	 That is exactly what they said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1158.5s	1158.5	 And this, and they will, I believe Robin Hood will write it out because they throttle the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1163.3s	1163.3	 number of people coming to platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1165.4s	1165.4	 Las Vegas is not designed for everybody in America to come to Las Vegas in the same weekend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1170.8s	1170.8	 And that's what's happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1172.0s	1172.0	 Will you admit that the tens of millions of people that had their hard earned money inside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1176.8s	1176.8	 of Robin Hood was prevented from participating in trades that could have been executed other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1183.6s	1183.6	 places because of an arbitrary decision by Robin Hood that they had to stay insolvent?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1189.8s	1189.8	 How is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1190.8s	1190.8	 How is that an arbitrary decision?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1193.1s	1193.1	 Do you think they wanted to make that decision?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1195.0s	1195.0	 Jason, that's me telling you that they were insolvent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1197.4s	1197.4	 That's not them saying it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1198.4s	1198.4	 This is what I'm saying right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1199.4s	1199.4	 The communication was not perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1200.4s	1200.4	 I'll agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1201.4s	1201.4	 The communication was not perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1202.4s	1202.4	 They should have just said we had no choice but to stop this or we would have been insolvent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1205.9s	1205.9	 We cannot take this many trades.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1207.8s	1207.8	 But is that what we call lies when people's money gets fucked over?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1211.5s	1211.5	 Just it's inconvenient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1212.5s	1212.5	 Let me just say one thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1213.5s	1213.5	 I'm going to interject your vigorous debate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1218.7s	1218.7	 The important thing I think to note is Robin Hood makes money effectively, as Chamath pointed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1223.4s	1223.4	 out, through arbitrage of pricing in the markets and by providing leverage to their clients.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1230.5s	1230.5	 The clients can trade beyond their means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1232.3s	1232.3	 I used to be an investor in a Forex trading company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1235.5s	1235.5	 It was the largest Forex trading platform in the world for retail investors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1238.8s	1238.8	 60% of those accounts went bankrupt over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1243.0s	1243.0	 There was a lifetime value on an account because the customer would come in, they'd trade foreign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1247.7s	1247.7	 exchange rates up and down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1249.9s	1249.9	 They would ultimately just get burnt up and that was it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1254.3s	1254.3	 Robin Hood makes money when the market is non-volatile, when there isn't a lot of swings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1259.8s	1259.8	 Suddenly, when there is a swing, and that's how they're able to provide their free pricing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1263.8s	1263.8	 to people, they're making a spread.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1265.5s	1265.5	 But suddenly, when there is a swing and the spread start to widen, they are actually exposed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1269.3s	1269.3	 to losing money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1270.3s	1270.3	 So Jason, it's true what Chamath is saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1273.9s	1273.9	 They did face a liquidity crisis to some extent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1276.2s	1276.2	 That's why they had to draw that additional capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1278.6s	1278.6	 But it was a function of their business model.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1281.0s	1281.0	 It provides great benefit and value in some extent during good times, but when times get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1285.1s	1285.1	 bad, it's like, oh shit, things are at risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1287.8s	1287.8	 That's very similar to the Lehman and their startup model.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1290.6s	1290.6	 I don't disagree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1293.0s	1293.0	 I think this is an unprecedented situation with the number of participants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1296.8s	1296.8	 It reminds me of surge pricing with Uber during snowstorms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1301.0s	1301.0	 That also was an unintended thing that who knew that it would go up to $400 to take a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1306.2s	1306.2	 ride?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1307.2s	1307.2	 And that's something that companies will be faced with, and they will have to then adjust
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1311.6s	1311.6	 and then make it work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1312.8s	1312.8	 And I think in the case of Robinhood, they should have just came up on Wednesday and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1317.4s	1317.4	 said, we can't take any more orders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1319.4s	1319.4	 We can't take any more new customers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1321.2s	1321.2	 We're pausing signups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1322.2s	1322.2	 You'll be on a wait list because we will be insolvent if you guys make any more trades.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1326.6s	1326.6	 And that would have, I don't know if you believe that would have...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1328.6s	1328.6	 I agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1329.6s	1329.6	 So Jason, let me just explain the mechanic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1330.6s	1330.6	 So that is poor communication for the rookie founder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1332.6s	1332.6	 It's not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1333.6s	1333.6	 Jason, it's beyond poor communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1336.1s	1336.1	 People were blocked out of their accounts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1337.9s	1337.9	 Like there was hundreds of million incalculable amounts of economic loss that was born.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1342.7s	1342.7	 I don't know if that's going to wind up being true because all these trades are occurring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1345.4s	1345.4	 now and the stock is a rocket ship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1348.1s	1348.1	 Who's to say that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1349.1s	1349.1	 No, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1350.1s	1350.1	 I mean, look, I mean, Jason...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1351.6s	1351.6	 And aren't the shorts all covered by now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1353.3s	1353.3	 That's what they've been saying at CNBC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1355.0s	1355.0	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1356.0s	1356.0	 There are still people...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1357.0s	1357.0	 How do you know how many people are short right now and how many shares?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1359.5s	1359.5	 Because it's the primes put the data together and they send it to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1362.8s	1362.8	 Do you have it handy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1363.8s	1363.8	 Because I've been looking for it online and they said 10 times the number of shares short
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1366.8s	1366.8	 have traded hands in the last 10 days or five days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1369.2s	1369.2	 Jason, I don't have it literally in front of me, but I could get it in the next hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1373.2s	1373.2	 Just text one of your people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1374.2s	1374.2	 You got all these researchers there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1375.2s	1375.2	 Go ahead, Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1376.2s	1376.2	 Okay, look, I'm going to try and thread the needle here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1380.2s	1380.2	 I think J-Cal is right that we shouldn't impugn people's motives without having all the information.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1389.2s	1389.2	 Furthermore, building these rapidly scaling startups is really tough and it could have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1394.1s	1394.1	 just been a function of not knowing how to deal with unprecedented growing pains.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1399.6s	1399.6	 So I don't think...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1400.6s	1400.6	 I don't want to be too judgmental about what happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1402.6s	1402.6	 Can I just stop you there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1403.6s	1403.6	 Hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1404.6s	1404.6	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1405.6s	1405.6	 No, but David, that's not...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1407.6s	1407.6	 But you guys are not being accurate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1410.0s	1410.0	 They have known for decades, for years, sorry, years, how this business works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1414.6s	1414.6	 When somebody buys a call option, they are legally obligated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1418.5s	1418.5	 When they send that order through, they have to post margin on behalf of that person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1424.1s	1424.1	 So they saw this building.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1426.5s	1426.5	 This happened in March of 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1428.7s	1428.7	 They went through this liquidity crisis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1430.9s	1430.9	 They've had to draw credit lines before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1433.1s	1433.1	 They saw it building in the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1435.2s	1435.2	 So this was nothing except negligence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1437.6s	1437.6	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1438.8s	1438.8	 So I was about to...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1439.8s	1439.8	 I hadn't gotten to the part where I was about to agree with you, Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1442.4s	1442.4	 I mean, look, all I'm saying is even if it was negligence, I'm not sure I would impugn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1447.2s	1447.2	 all the motives to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1449.0s	1449.0	 That's all I'm saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1450.0s	1450.0	 I'm trying to find some common ground with J.K.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1451.2s	1451.2	 on that point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1452.2s	1452.2	 But where I totally agree with you, Chamath, is with respect to the effects of their decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1458.2s	1458.2	 I mean, the effects of that decision they made to stop trading and specifically, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1462.0s	1462.0	 didn't stop people from selling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1464.3s	1464.3	 They only stopped people from buying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1466.2s	1466.2	 So they shut down one side of the trade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1468.5s	1468.5	 And the effect of that was we had these hedge funds from Wall Street.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1471.8s	1471.8	 They were on the ropes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1472.8s	1472.8	 Right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1473.8s	1473.8	 I mean, let's discuss who these guys are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1475.7s	1475.7	 These are the apex predators of Wall Street.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1478.8s	1478.8	 They are in the business of shorting companies to destroy them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1483.4s	1483.4	 I mean, that is their business model.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1485.1s	1485.1	 And they are not academic traders, okay, who are just speculating on outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1489.7s	1489.7	 They engineer the outcome, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1492.2s	1492.2	 Look at their tactics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1493.2s	1493.2	 Just watch the show Billions, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1494.5s	1494.5	 They hire PR people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1496.2s	1496.2	 They hire private investigators.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1498.2s	1498.2	 They're participating on these message boards spreading disinformation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1502.4s	1502.4	 Look at the year of hell that Elon went through, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1505.0s	1505.0	 They tried to destroy Tesla.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1506.0s	1506.0	 It's like five years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1507.0s	1507.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1508.0s	1508.0	 Yeah, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1509.0s	1509.0	 They tried to destroy companies to engineer that outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1511.4s	1511.4	 They create nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1512.4s	1512.4	 They're in the business of destruction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1515.3s	1515.3	 Now, the beautiful thing is you had these Reddit kids, these pirates who published this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1520.6s	1520.6	 manifesto, right, on Reddit, basically being the heirs to Occupy Wall Street.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1526.0s	1526.0	 They recognized, look, occupying like a physical space does nothing to these guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1532.5s	1532.5	 We're going to hurt them where it counts in their pocketbook.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1534.1s	1534.1	 We are going to get together and we're going to basically create a trade mob that's even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1537.8s	1537.8	 bigger than their cartel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1539.5s	1539.5	 And they did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1540.5s	1540.5	 They got 2.7 million people taking the other side of this trade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1543.2s	1543.2	 And then when the hedge funds doubled down, they said, fuck you, we're going to double,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1546.8s	1546.8	 we're going to triple down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1548.5s	1548.5	 And the guy on Reddit said, listen, paraphrasing John Maynard Keynes said, we can be retarded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1553.8s	1553.8	 longer than you can be solvent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1555.8s	1555.8	 And they were winning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1556.8s	1556.8	 That was what they said, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1558.5s	1558.5	 And they were winning the trade, okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1560.4s	1560.4	 And Melvin was dead busted and Citron was on its way to being dead busted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1565.0s	1565.0	 And they had to go to Big Papa Stevie Cone, okay, and Ken Griffin to get their rebys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1572.2s	1572.2	 to buy their rebys to get back into the game, okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1576.5s	1576.5	 And then they had these guys on the ropes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1578.8s	1578.8	 They had them felted, okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1580.6s	1580.6	 And then what happens?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1582.2s	1582.2	 Just at the moment where they're going to like basically bust them out of the game for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1586.0s	1586.0	 good, Robinhood shuts down the buy side of the trade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1590.6s	1590.6	 And so what does that do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1591.6s	1591.6	 It gives these hedge funds time to regroup, to unspool the trade, to reposition and save
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1596.8s	1596.8	 themselves, and to get out of the trade if they want to get out of the trade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1600.0s	1600.0	 You can never take that 24 hour time period back, no matter what Robinhood does now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1604.7s	1604.7	 And so I agree with Jamath, this was like, this was tremendously disruptive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1608.1s	1608.1	 Don't you think, David, on that point, I think it's, I am in agreement that the hedge funds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1611.4s	1611.4	 deserve to get their assets get 100%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1614.3s	1614.3	 I also, as I said, we don't have complete information of why, you know, Robinhood had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1620.5s	1620.5	 to pause trading and the other platforms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1622.0s	1622.0	 And it was like five platforms, by the way, that had to stop or else they would be insolvent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1625.9s	1625.9	 because nothing like this has ever happened before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1628.4s	1628.4	 This is a run that nobody's ever seen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1630.9s	1630.9	 And now we're back in the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1632.5s	1632.5	 And don't you think all this attention then drives more people to buy GameStop, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1636.9s	1636.9	 is what's happening today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1638.7s	1638.7	 And that they're still going to get crushed because they're still going to have to cover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1641.1s	1641.1	 I mean, we look, I don't like, like I said, look, where I agree with you is I think the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1647.4s	1647.4	 consequences of this decision by Robinhood were, I mean, they were really bad, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1652.8s	1652.8	 I mean, we finally had these shorts on the ropes where they deserve to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1656.6s	1656.6	 Finally they're getting a taste of their own medicine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1658.3s	1658.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1659.3s	1659.3	 And it was really bad to pull the plug on the renters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1662.5s	1662.5	 They wish they didn't have to, I'm sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1664.1s	1664.1	 Okay, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1665.1s	1665.1	 And I don't know what went into that decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1667.5s	1667.5	 But here's the thing that I think kind of stinks about it is the point that Tramath
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1671.5s	1671.5	 is making about who is doing the trade execution for Robinhood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1677.8s	1677.8	 Those trades are flowing to Citadel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1681.8s	1681.8	 Well that's part of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1683.3s	1683.3	 That's part of it, but 40, 47%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1685.5s	1685.5	 But who is now on the short side of the trade?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1688.4s	1688.4	 Citadel went in and bailed out Melvin and Citron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1691.9s	1691.9	 And so they're on both sides of this trade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1694.0s	1694.0	 Now how does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1695.2s	1695.2	 Well Citadel, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1697.6s	1697.6	 What I would like to know specifically, okay, is did anybody from Citadel reach out and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1704.5s	1704.5	 touch Robinhood?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1706.3s	1706.3	 Did anybody at Citadel put in the fix and say to Robinhood, we're going to cut you off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1712.9s	1712.9	 We're going to cut you off, you know, unless you freeze out the buy side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1717.5s	1717.5	 Now look, 99% chance that didn't happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1719.6s	1719.6	 I don't know, but that is a legitimate question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1721.6s	1721.6	 We need to know the answer to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1722.6s	1722.6	 Can I just tell you, the question is important, but the way that you phrase it is you call
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1727.8s	1727.8	 them and you basically say, listen, you need to post $500 million of margin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1732.1s	1732.1	 Why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1733.1s	1733.1	 Oh, well these trades, you know, we're going to arbitrarily change the margin requirements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1737.2s	1737.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1738.2s	1738.2	 Oh, you need to raise, you need to post.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1739.9s	1739.9	 So then what they did was they pulled all the credit lines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1743.0s	1743.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1744.0s	1744.0	 They post margin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1745.0s	1745.0	 Trades are still happening like crazy, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1747.2s	1747.2	 All these people are buying GameStop calls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1749.3s	1749.3	 They have to go because look, when you buy a call, when you as a user, when David Friedberg,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1754.6s	1754.6	 Quinoa buys a call, Robinhood becomes synthetically shorted, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1760.2s	1760.2	 Robinhood doesn't have the share to sell you, but it's giving it to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1763.6s	1763.6	 So they're technically short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1764.8s	1764.8	 They got to go buy it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1766.5s	1766.5	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1767.5s	1767.5	 So this is what creates this dynamic where Robinhood knew, they knew every second of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1773.3s	1773.3	 every moment what was happening and more importantly, what could happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1779.1s	1779.1	 At a minimum, it's negligence and at a maximum, it's the fix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1782.7s	1782.7	 Well, it was fine to do it before the market started to swing volatile, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1787.7s	1787.7	 And so when the market wasn't high volume and when it wasn't volatile, it didn't matter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1792.4s	1792.4	 because they had appropriate levels of surplus capital or statutory capital or whatever the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1796.6s	1796.6	 definition is in this market to be able to cover the quote unquote VAR or the value at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1802.9s	1802.9	 risk of their portfolio of their customers worst case outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1807.2s	1807.2	 But as soon as that spiked, as soon as the VAR spiked, they had to go get more capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1812.5s	1812.5	 And so what do you do if you're the manager of Robinhood in that situation where your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1816.3s	1816.3	 clients who've been making you a bunch of money by trading stocks over the last couple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1821.1s	1821.1	 of years, suddenly they all get themselves in a bind where the VAR on the portfolio is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1826.2s	1826.2	 more than the cash Robinhood has to clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1828.4s	1828.4	 Assuming all these people go bankrupt, that's where Robinhood had to scramble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1832.5s	1832.5	 And so in that circumstance, they drew down debt and they had to go get a billion dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1836.4s	1836.4	 of equity. But if you guys were running that business and I'm not speaking for Robinhood's,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1840.8s	1840.8	 I'm not making the case for Robinhood, but what would you guys have done in that circumstance?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1844.7s	1844.7	 You know, suddenly all your and by the way, I'm saying they created the problem for themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1848.6s	1848.6	 because they allowed people to trade on margin with low bank with low account balances and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1852.8s	1852.8	 volatile stocks prior to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1854.7s	1854.7	 It got away from them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1856.0s	1856.0	 You can't you cannot run a business like that and be selective and arbitrary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1861.3s	1861.3	 You can't say some stocks on certain days, some stocks on other days, some options over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1865.7s	1865.7	 here, some puts over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1867.6s	1867.6	 That means you're a fucking moron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1870.2s	1870.2	 And what do you do on Tuesday or Wednesday when all of a sudden you're not here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1874.8s	1874.8	 Wednesday, this if you were a reasonable manager of a business like this, this conversation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1879.9s	1879.9	 would have been happening at a board meeting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1881.5s	1881.5	 I told her to go hold on a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1883.9s	1883.9	 Let me finish, please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1884.9s	1884.9	 OK, it needs to happen quarters ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1887.4s	1887.4	 And in quarters ago, what they would have said is, hey, guys, we've run some scenario
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1890.8s	1890.8	 analyses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1892.0s	1892.0	 We've done some sensitivity analyses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1894.3s	1894.3	 Here's what happens if all of these things can go against us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1897.0s	1897.0	 That's a typical stress test that a bank has to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1899.8s	1899.8	 When you're a structurally important bank, you have legislation that forces you to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1904.4s	1904.4	 under these conditions where you have to make sure that you can understand some of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1908.9s	1908.9	 scenarios and then you have to have any any trading entity or insurance company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1912.4s	1912.4	 They all have to have that analysis of what's the worst case scenario and how do you plan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1915.8s	1915.8	 for it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1916.8s	1916.8	 And you have to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1917.8s	1917.8	 And by the way, coming out of 2008, we actually legislated that we needed to have these two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1922.2s	1922.2	 and three sigma events scenario planning and you needed to have proper credit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1926.7s	1926.7	 So here's what happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1927.7s	1927.7	 Really.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1928.7s	1928.7	 Number one, it was under-equitized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1929.7s	1929.7	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1930.7s	1930.7	 At a minimum, the business was massively relative to what they were letting their customers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1935.4s	1935.4	 do exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1936.4s	1936.4	 And that's really important because the point is they let people trade with high margin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1940.6s	1940.6	 and they let people trade in volatile stocks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1943.0s	1943.0	 And it was working until not just stocks, but options, which is what which is what creates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1947.7s	1947.7	 the real spin up the feedback loop that blows this whole thing up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1951.7s	1951.7	 And then number two is they don't know what they're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1956.3s	1956.3	 I think one thing that's really important, I just want to say this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1960.4s	1960.4	 We should stop pretending that trading in stocks is investing in businesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1965.9s	1965.9	 And this is something we've said for a long time on Wall Street, but stocks, shorting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1972.5s	1972.5	 margin and derivatives, those those four things no longer look like what the capital markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1980.0s	1980.0	 originally set up for, which was to help capitalize businesses and allow people to exit their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1984.6s	1984.6	 investment and helping to capitalize that business to another investor that wants to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1987.7s	1987.7	 come along.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1988.7s	1988.7	 It has effectively become a synthetic casino or a synthetic gambling model that lets people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1994.1s	1994.1	 trade things up and down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1995.3s	1995.3	 And this has been the mainstay of Wall Street for the last couple of decades.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=1999.4s	1999.4	 And as you pointed out, Sachs, it really is a leech on the system because the amount of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2004.3s	2004.3	 money that trading firms and traders and hedge funds make doing this ultimately is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2010.2s	2010.2	 taking away from capital that could be invested in actual businesses that could drive job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2014.9s	2014.9	 growth, drive economic prosperity, drive innovation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2018.7s	2018.7	 And the volatility that I think we've seen is the ultimate feedback loop that emerges
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2024.5s	2024.5	 from when you allow a casino to operate that sits under the guise of being business capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2030.9s	2030.9	 and investing in businesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2032.7s	2032.7	 It's not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2033.8s	2033.8	 I'll give you guys a statistic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2035.4s	2035.4	 I downloaded the data from CBOE that analyzes how much volume was traded across all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2040.7s	2040.7	 equity markets last year in the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2044.7s	2044.7	 Stocks traded a total volume last year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2046.7s	2046.7	 You guys ready for this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2048.3s	2048.3	 Hundred twenty one trillion dollars of notional across two point seven trillion trades.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2056.8s	2056.8	 Do you think that one hundred and twenty one trillion dollars of notional equity value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2061.1s	2061.1	 trading provided capital to businesses anywhere close to one percent of that total amount
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2066.7s	2066.7	 of trading volume?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2068.1s	2068.1	 It really is a synthetic instrument that allows people to participate in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2072.1s	2072.1	 I bet that something is going to go up and I bet that something is going to go down with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2076.1s	2076.1	 other people of a similar ilk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2078.5s	2078.5	 And one person makes money and one person loses money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2080.5s	2080.5	 And at the end of the day, the underlying business entity doesn't benefit whatsoever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2084.4s	2084.4	 And you see it when shorts go against businesses like happened with Elon and Tesla.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2088.9s	2088.9	 And you see it when derivatives like CDOs blow up the fucking housing market where people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2093.1s	2093.1	 basically trade these derivatives that sit on top of housing and that capital did not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2097.1s	2097.1	 find its way into homes to help people buy homes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2100.3s	2100.3	 It ultimately led to the collapse of the only reason that Lehman and Bear Stearns was shut
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2106.4s	2106.4	 down was in 2007 and eight when they were in a liquidity crunch in the same thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2110.5s	2110.5	 And they basically had all these trades blowing up against them and they couldn't collateralize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2114.6s	2114.6	 them was that the people on the other side were hedge funds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2118.5s	2118.5	 And that's why they were put into the Fed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2120.9s	2120.9	 That's why we were able to basically come out relatively unscathed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2125.0s	2125.0	 But I mean by relatively unscathed is like a global calamity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2130.3s	2130.3	 The tragedy of this is that this is the tragedy of the commons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2133.2s	2133.2	 It's like there is no organization of people that can say, hey, listen, I'm really rich
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2137.7s	2137.7	 and wealthy and what happened here was wrong, even though it's probably on the same scale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2144.0s	2144.0	 And so everybody that was a participant in it is, in my opinion, I think is guilty of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2147.9s	2147.9	 all of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2148.9s	2148.9	 They were complicit in the robbing of America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2152.5s	2152.5	 Do you think calls and puts and shorting should be allowed should those markets exist?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2158.0s	2158.0	 I do have a sense of common sense solutions and let me kind of give you them and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2162.6s	2162.6	 you can tell me what you think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2163.6s	2163.6	 So the first is we need to use modern technology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2167.0s	2167.0	 Let's just start with that, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2168.1s	2168.1	 To ensure that one share of stock isn't loaned out multiple times so that you can't have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2174.4s	2174.4	 a scenario where you have more than 100% short interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2177.2s	2177.2	 That's a no-brainer, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2178.2s	2178.2	 That's a no-brainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2179.2s	2179.2	 So you still support shorting, Chamath?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2180.2s	2180.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2181.2s	2181.2	 Let me just go through the list and then you can tell me what you think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2183.5s	2183.5	 If high-frequency firms can trade tens of millions of shares per day, there's no reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2187.4s	2187.4	 why we can't reconcile who the beneficial owner of every share is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2191.1s	2191.1	 So maybe that's a, you know, now maybe we found the first obvious use case for a blockchain,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2197.4s	2197.4	 right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2198.4s	2198.4	 Like you can't borrow a share unless you can prove beneficial ownership in a nanosecond,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2204.1s	2204.1	 which can only be done on a decentralized ledger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2207.1s	2207.1	 But the point is, number one is we need to rebuild this infrastructure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2211.8s	2211.8	 You can't have 136% of a company be short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2214.9s	2214.9	 That makes no sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2216.4s	2216.4	 The second, what we've learned is that, again, it's like are we going to basically have these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2220.7s	2220.7	 blowups every 10 years before we actually address the elephant in the room, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2224.6s	2224.6	 leverage?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2225.6s	2225.6	 Like, you need to have leverage limits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2227.7s	2227.7	 So for example, banks coming out of 08 have super strict oversight and leverage limits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2233.7s	2233.7	 because they're dubbed systematically important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2237.0s	2237.0	 We don't do that for hedge funds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2238.4s	2238.4	 And I think we need to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2239.9s	2239.9	 And I think that we need to have the ability to realize that these guys can cause systemic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2244.4s	2244.4	 risks, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2245.4s	2245.4	 So just on this example, I don't know if you guys have ever heard about long-term capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2250.9s	2250.9	 management, LTCM, this guy John Merriwether?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2253.7s	2253.7	 The Asian currency crisis, the whole thing collapsed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2256.3s	2256.3	 There's a good book on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2258.1s	2258.1	 Well, so it's funny, but if you guys think this is the second financial calamity, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2261.9s	2261.9	 not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2262.9s	2262.9	 It's the third because the first one happened in 1998.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2265.7s	2265.7	 So in 1998, there was a firm called-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2269.5s	2269.5	 The whole economic system was going to collapse if the bailout didn't happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2273.4s	2273.4	 So listen to what these guys did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2275.2s	2275.2	 Long-term capital management borrowed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2278.2s	2278.2	 They had $4.8 billion of capital that limited partners and investors gave them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2284.5s	2284.5	 These fucking crooks were able to then borrow $125 billion, $125 billion on the $4.8 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2295.5s	2295.5	 of notional.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2296.5s	2296.5	 So they were able to lever themselves up 26 times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2299.4s	2299.4	 By the way, synthetic margin, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2301.0s	2301.0	 No actual capital was allocated to this transaction set.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2305.3s	2305.3	 It was all synthetic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2306.6s	2306.6	 No money moved accounts when these trades happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2309.0s	2309.0	 So it was literally just writing stuff against debt that couldn't have existed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2314.5s	2314.5	 So they built 60,000 trading positions and those individual positions represented, again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2322.5s	2322.5	 $1.4 trillion US dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2326.5s	2326.5	 So you took these guys in a room, took $4.8 billion, got knucklehead over here to give
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2335.1s	2335.1	 them $125 and then got these knuckleheads to sell them positions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2339.4s	2339.4	 All of a sudden, $4.8 billion equaled $1.4 trillion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2344.8s	2344.8	 And so then US regulators had to step in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2347.9s	2347.9	 They had to orchestrate a bailout from a consortium of banks because they were concerned that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2352.8s	2352.8	 if LTCM collapsed, the whole system would collapse because they didn't understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2358.7s	2358.7	 So we have to put leverage limits on top of hedge funds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2363.4s	2363.4	 The third is we need to improve disclosure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2366.2s	2366.2	 The rules at the SEC right now is to discourage disclosure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2370.8s	2370.8	 That doesn't make any sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2372.4s	2372.4	 We should force everybody to publish what they own on a weekly or monthly basis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2377.0s	2377.0	 You have the ability to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2378.3s	2378.3	 The technology is simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2380.2s	2380.2	 So you need to improve disclosure because then watchdogs and other people can basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2387.0s	2387.0	 be looking at it all day and identifying these risks faster, not slower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2393.6s	2393.6	 The third is we need to do something around open trading.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2397.1s	2397.1	 Why is it that people are allowed to go to casinos?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2400.2s	2400.2	 Why can you buy lottery tickets?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2404.7s	2404.7	 But all of a sudden, we're going to decide who's financially literate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2407.8s	2407.8	 A platform like Robinhood can decide what's bought and what's sold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2410.6s	2410.6	 I don't think that's fair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2413.0s	2413.0	 And then the last thing is I think that we should have a short-term trading tax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2418.7s	2418.7	 We tried to pass one in 2018, 10 basis points.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2421.6s	2421.6	 If you had passed this 10 basis point tax in 2018 on short-term trading, it would have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2425.1s	2425.1	 created a trillion dollars almost.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2427.4s	2427.4	 I did the math on this because the reason I ran all the equity numbers was to figure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2432.1s	2432.1	 this number out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2433.4s	2433.4	 So in the US, we generated $160 billion in capital gains tax last year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2440.0s	2440.0	 And if you look at the volume I described earlier in terms of notional traded of equities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2444.2s	2444.2	 and number of shares traded, if you charge 0.1% every time someone sold a share on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2450.5s	2450.5	 value of the share they sold, it would equal the capital gains tax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2454.1s	2454.1	 So what you could do is you could charge 0.1% on every trade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2458.3s	2458.3	 It would reduce all of this high-frequency nonsense where people trade in and out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2461.7s	2461.7	 stocks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2462.7s	2462.7	 It would force people to trade for the longer term or basically invest in companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2466.1s	2466.1	 And you could get rid of the capital gains tax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2468.2s	2468.2	 Think about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2469.2s	2469.2	 If we didn't have to pay capital gains tax and we were only taxed when we traded out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2473.7s	2473.7	 of a stock 0.1%, you could see an incredible amount of capital making its way into businesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2479.5s	2479.5	 And this would fuel economic growth and jobs and prosperity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2483.0s	2483.0	 And so I think if you could pull that off, put the two together, a 0.1% sales tax on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2487.0s	2487.0	 every share sold and get rid of capital gains tax, it could be incredibly powerful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2491.7s	2491.7	 The lobbyists got to that bill, but that 10 basis point tax on high-frequency trading,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2495.8s	2495.8	 it just means like, look, if you're going to trade a whole bunch of shit every eight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2498.5s	2498.5	 seconds, you just have to pay 10 basis points in and out, $777 billion of incremental revenue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2505.3s	2505.3	 to the federal government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2506.3s	2506.3	 And it was lobbied out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2507.9s	2507.9	 And I agree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2509.9s	2509.9	 More money goes in, more money makes its way into companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2513.6s	2513.6	 You stop all the nonsense where people are basically trading to bet that something will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2516.8s	2516.8	 go up in the short term, and you get people to make investments in the business as opposed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2520.8s	2520.8	 to the momentum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2522.7s	2522.7	 Lowering the capital gains rate is genius because I think that if you are a retail investor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2527.5s	2527.5	 and for every year you hold, if you can decrease your cap gains rate by 20%, by the fifth year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2534.1s	2534.1	 now all of a sudden retail folks aren't necessarily gambling, they're owning, and their cap gains
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2538.9s	2538.9	 rate would be zero after five years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2540.4s	2540.4	 That would be amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2541.4s	2541.4	 I have a basic question I'm interested in your position, Saxon, maybe even around the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2547.2s	2547.2	 horn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2548.7s	2548.7	 What happens to the, if the short positions get covered, which they're going to be at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2552.5s	2552.5	 some point in GameStop, I would think, or some large amount of them, and the short squeezes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2556.4s	2556.4	 off, what happens to the people who are buying in, you know, to the meme stock as a retail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2563.8s	2563.8	 investor, let's say over the next 10 days, are they going to be left holding the bags?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2567.5s	2567.5	 Is there any way this company could be worth 20 billion or 25 billion?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2571.4s	2571.4	 Because as Freeberg points out, people are not buying GameStop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2574.8s	2574.8	 They're trying to destroy a hedge fund who made a stupid, manipulative bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2579.8s	2579.8	 Great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2580.8s	2580.8	 We all love the Robin Hood story of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2583.4s	2583.4	 Not Robin Hood TM, but the generic term Robin Hood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2587.7s	2587.7	 What happens to those people?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2588.7s	2588.7	 Are they going to be the last people holding the bag?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2590.8s	2590.8	 Probably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2591.8s	2591.8	 This is not going to end well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2592.8s	2592.8	 There's no question about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2593.8s	2593.8	 I totally agree with you that people engaging in this kind of speculation and buying at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2597.1s	2597.1	 these prices, it's not going to end well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2599.1s	2599.1	 Now, I do think that the Redditors actually had a brilliant strategy, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2604.0s	2604.0	 When they noticed that these hedge funds were over short, over exposed, and they seized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2608.9s	2608.9	 on that vulnerability, they did to the hedge funds what the hedge funds usually do to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2613.2s	2613.2	 everybody else, which is find the Achilles heel, right, and pile it in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2616.8s	2616.8	 So I think the strategy started brilliant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2619.1s	2619.1	 Now, anyone who's piling into it, I'd be real careful because I think the hedge funds have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2623.6s	2623.6	 regrouped and the idea that you're going to beat them at their own game when, look, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2631.8s	2631.8	 mean, Citadel is executing your trades.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2634.3s	2634.3	 I mean, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2636.1s	2636.1	 The order flow is going from Robin Hood to Citadel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2638.9s	2638.9	 They're not going to be caught flat footed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2640.3s	2640.3	 They're on the other side of this trade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2642.3s	2642.3	 And so I just think the house always wins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2644.9s	2644.9	 I'd be real careful about getting into it at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2648.2s	2648.2	 I think we just see you guys know Robin Hood just tweeted that now the list of restricted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2654.7s	2654.7	 names is now up to almost 35 or 40.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2658.4s	2658.4	 I think it's worth the randomly picking companies, guys, RLX.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2662.8s	2662.8	 What is RLX? I think that's Ralph Lauren.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2666.5s	2666.5	 Nope, you're not allowed to trade that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2668.6s	2668.6	 SNDL. I don't know what that is, but you can only buy 10 shares.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2671.9s	2671.9	 Would a better solution should be for them if they can't handle this and they have the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2675.3s	2675.3	 risk of ruin to just say we're not adding any more accounts until we can digest all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2680.4s	2680.4	 this and raise enough capital to float all this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2682.6s	2682.6	 And do you think there's a chance the SEC is telling them you've got to pump the brakes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2686.1s	2686.1	 on this because we can't have a market crash?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2688.4s	2688.4	 Two questions tomorrow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2690.5s	2690.5	 I think that the issue isn't Robin Hood's ability to grow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2697.3s	2697.3	 It's that they don't have their ability to run their business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2699.8s	2699.8	 And so their incompetence is going to cause them to, I think, have to deal with if they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2704.3s	2704.3	 had 20 billion dollars in cash right now, this would not be an issue, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2707.3s	2707.3	 I think you're right. OK, so assuming they can line that up, because that's probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2711.3s	2711.3	 what's going on right now is a 10 billion dollar investment is going to go into this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2715.4s	2715.4	 company pre IPO so that they can actually take advantage of this situation and grow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2719.6s	2719.6	 So despite the fact that you have an axe to grind with them because you have so far a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2722.9s	2722.9	 competitor that's very far behind them, that had its own colossal problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2726.6s	2726.6	 Let's put that aside for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2727.9s	2727.9	 You're talking your own book without even mentioning it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2730.9s	2730.9	 Do you think that if they had that 10 billion, they would just open up all the doors?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2734.7s	2734.7	 Or do you think maybe they should say, hey, we're not going to add anybody else?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2738.3s	2738.3	 I think that what's going to happen is they're going to get sued into oblivion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2742.1s	2742.1	 I think that the class action lawsuits here, when people talk about the implied losses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2747.7s	2747.7	 that that they that they had over the last 24 hours, David Sacks is right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2751.6s	2751.6	 You can't undo it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2752.6s	2752.6	 The thing is, like in all of these other situations, like in the Uber fiasco, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2757.4s	2757.4	 know, you can't claim much damage, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2759.6s	2759.6	 Because you can't measure it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2760.5s	2760.5	 You could have taken a bus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2761.7s	2761.7	 You could have taken a taxi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2762.9s	2762.9	 You know, you could have taken a Lyft.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2765.5s	2765.5	 Maybe you could have walked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2766.4s	2766.4	 Who knows what it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2767.3s	2767.3	 But the point is that the economic impacts, I think, were much less than maybe the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2772.8s	2772.8	 psychological impact, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2774.1s	2774.1	 Like you were angry here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2775.6s	2775.6	 It's the exact opposite, which is that you prevented people from transacting in an open
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2779.6s	2779.6	 market. And when people signed up to use the service, that's what they thought they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2782.6s	2782.6	 were signing up for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2784.3s	2784.3	 And they thought that that the risk on the back end would be managed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2786.9s	2786.9	 You have to remember, it's not that the individuals did anything wrong by buying or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2790.6s	2790.6	 selling. It's that Robinhood did something wrong by not being able to manage their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2794.4s	2794.4	 business accurately. And then that then impacted the users to the tune of tens of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2798.5s	2798.5	 billions of dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2799.9s	2799.9	 That has to get adjudicated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2801.5s	2801.5	 And so, yeah, I think the right thing to do is to stop the business, hit the pause
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2805.6s	2805.6	 button, allow people to elegantly transfer their money out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2808.7s	2808.7	 Do we have to remember on the back end of this, whenever that you have one of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2813.0s	2813.0	 market failures, the clearing houses are allowed to instantaneously close your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2819.1s	2819.1	 account and transfer to another broker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2823.3s	2823.3	 Instantaneously, you have that right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2826.0s	2826.0	 And so the market does understand the systemic risk at some level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2829.2s	2829.2	 They just didn't push it all the way through to the end of retail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2832.1s	2832.1	 And so we're going to have to unwind this and unscramble this egg because it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2836.0s	2836.0	 really it's a really big problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2839.5s	2839.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2840.8s	2840.8	 Growing, growing willy nilly because everybody's infatuated with valuations and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2846.0s	2846.0	 blah, blah, blah. And you move into a regulated market where you needed to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2850.3s	2850.3	 understand capital constraints.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2851.9s	2851.9	 You needed to understand modeling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2853.3s	2853.3	 You needed to understand three and four sigma events.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2856.2s	2856.2	 It just means you're underprepared, which means at a minimum, you can't be doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2859.3s	2859.3	 business until you get that shit under control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2862.1s	2862.1	 Yeah, I actually think we're almost in sync on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2866.7s	2866.7	 You have a little bit of an axe to grind because of your other portfolio company, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2869.9s	2869.9	 think, that you still won't recognize that you have a horse in the race.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2874.1s	2874.1	 So far, I just did they did they finish resolving all of their harassment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2878.8s	2878.8	 lawsuits? Is that all resolved now or is that still open?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2882.6s	2882.6	 Yeah, we've we've that you took them public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2884.2s	2884.2	 So did did you work all that out before you took them public?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2886.9s	2886.9	 Yeah, Jason, we we transitioned the CEO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2889.1s	2889.1	 We completely hired a new team.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2891.6s	2891.6	 Great. I mean, it's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2893.5s	2893.5	 So your company that you took public can resolve issues and you can give them time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2898.3s	2898.3	 and then you can, in fact, become their mentor and you can become their savior to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2903.3s	2903.3	 get them public and save that company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2905.1s	2905.1	 Jason, you should Robin Hood can't Robin Hood can't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2908.2s	2908.2	 Chamath can't talk about his company that's going public right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2911.3s	2911.3	 So just as his lawyer, I'm going to step in and make sure you don't go to him and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2916.2s	2916.2	 just say something he shouldn't say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2917.3s	2917.3	 All of our companies and I don't mean to create a lot of collateral damage here, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2921.9s	2921.9	 Saks had a company that had challenges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2924.0s	2924.0	 Chamath had companies of challenges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2925.1s	2925.1	 We all had companies that challenges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2926.7s	2926.7	 And I think focusing on what is the role of an investor when your company faces
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2931.5s	2931.5	 challenges, I think the role of the investor should be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2934.3s	2934.3	 And I take umbrage to you, Chamath, trying to dunk on me because I'm supporting an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2938.2s	2938.2	 investment. I think it's a low blow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2940.8s	2940.8	 And I take it personally. I'll be totally honest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2942.9s	2942.9	 I am trying to work with the company to help them resolve the issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2946.0s	2946.0	 And I need to be loyal to my founders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2947.9s	2947.9	 And I need to say, hey, how do we resolve this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2951.2s	2951.2	 How do we get here and work with them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2953.2s	2953.2	 And I'm sorry that I'm ride or die, but that's how I approach this is I should be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2957.3s	2957.3	 trying to be helpful as a shareholder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2959.1s	2959.1	 Could you make the argument that someone dunking on your company is the equivalent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2963.8s	2963.8	 of a hedge fund shorting a company?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2966.2s	2966.2	 I'm talking about my personal relationship with Chamath, which, you know, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2969.7s	2969.7	 different than, you know, the public markets, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2972.4s	2972.4	 I know. But I what I'm saying is like, I think in the private markets, we hear a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2975.8s	2975.8	 lot about venture investors, you know, often speaking good about their own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2979.9s	2979.9	 companies where people really get irritated is when venture investors speak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2984.2s	2984.2	 bad about other companies. It's the equivalent of the hedge fund short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2987.7s	2987.7	 And, you know, it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2991.0s	2991.0	 Jake, I mean, Chamath may be dunking on Robin Hood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2993.8s	2993.8	 I don't hear him dunking on you. I mean, not really.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2996.1s	2996.1	 I stumbled into the investment at the opening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=2998.7s	2998.7	 Well, you stumbled into Vlad in a bar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3001.1s	3001.1	 I mean, that's what you told you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3002.9s	3002.9	 Jason, you told the story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3004.5s	3004.5	 Jason, you told the story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3005.9s	3005.9	 He recognized me in a bar and came up and.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3008.1s	3008.1	 I'm sorry, but you told the story flippantly on television that you ran into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3011.5s	3011.5	 Mennatonio's Nuthouse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3013.1s	3013.1	 What do you want us to think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3014.4s	3014.4	 You didn't tell us, hey, listen, I had I had systematic scouts reach out based on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3018.4s	3018.4	 traffic growth. I sat down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3019.7s	3019.7	 They've got my that's not how I get Difflo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3021.7s	3021.7	 Fine. By doing a podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3023.4s	3023.4	 So, Jason, then, Jake, if you want me to apologize for saying your flow is through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3026.9s	3026.9	 this. But, Jason, if you want me to apologize for saying that you stumbled into it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3030.9s	3030.9	 based on your public description on television, then I'm sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3034.0s	3034.0	 But it doesn't take away from what we have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3036.4s	3036.4	 I think the investors responsibility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3038.7s	3038.7	 This is what I think is fundamentally wrong with Silicon Valley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3041.8s	3041.8	 We are people that basically do this, like hero worship around founders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3046.7s	3046.7	 And it's stupid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3047.9s	3047.9	 I think we have a job as fiduciaries to the users and to the employees and to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3052.4s	3052.4	 everybody else that doesn't have a voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3053.8s	3053.8	 And most investors are incapable of actually pushing people to do the right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3057.4s	3057.4	
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3058.0s	3058.0	 I'm pushing to do the right thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3059.3s	3059.3	 And I always I've learned the hard way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3060.6s	3060.6	 And in this example, what I'm saying is that I'm pushing to do the right thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3063.4s	3063.4	 And in this example, what I'm saying is this problem should have been solved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3067.3s	3067.3	 three and four quarters ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3069.5s	3069.5	 And that's a governance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3070.5s	3070.5	 Yeah, I mean, look, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3071.7s	3071.7	 You're such a mouth. You're right about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3073.5s	3073.5	 But I mean, just to give Jake out a little support here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3076.5s	3076.5	 I mean, the reality is, you know, we've all been on the inside of these hyper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3079.5s	3079.5	 growth companies and, you know, like mistakes happen all the time because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3083.9s	3083.9	 you're moving so fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3084.9s	3084.9	 And yes, it should have it should have been fixed, you know, but but, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3089.7s	3089.7	 stuff happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3090.5s	3090.5	 And the question is, when bad stuff happens, is it an integrity issue or is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3093.9s	3093.9	 it negligence or is it just people running too fast?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3097.1s	3097.1	 And I don't think we know that this was an integrity problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3100.6s	3100.6	 I mean, it could have just been people running too fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3103.3s	3103.3	 But David, that's what you knew what the rules were, meaning I don't think I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3107.4s	3107.4	 think it is an integrity issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3108.9s	3108.9	 The rules were not like all of a sudden in a crystal ball and all of there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3113.1s	3113.1	 magic eight ball that spits out a rule.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3114.9s	3114.9	 When you do a deal with DTCC, when you did a deal with your holding company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3119.3s	3119.3	 clearing, you signed contracts, those contracts should have been modelable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3124.1s	3124.1	 This is an Excel problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3126.1s	3126.1	 This is not like I hear what you're saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3128.9s	3128.9	 And I'm saying I don't completely know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3130.5s	3130.5	 I want to get to the bottom of the relationship between Citadel and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3134.0s	3134.0	 Robin Hood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3134.5s	3134.5	 And I want to understand if there is any undue influence there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3138.1s	3138.1	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3138.6s	3138.6	 Or whether this was just a case of hyper growth catching a company by surprise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3143.3s	3143.3	 I'm not defending them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3144.6s	3144.6	 I'm just saying I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3146.2s	3146.2	 And therefore, I think it's a little bit premature to be talking about giving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3149.3s	3149.3	 this company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3149.7s	3149.7	 And I also don't think you say, is there even a possibility that this has ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3153.5s	3153.5	 happened in the history of the stock market or the modern stock market?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3156.8s	3156.8	 That 10 million new and hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3158.5s	3158.5	 I even say what it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3159.7s	3159.7	 10 million new retail investors came into a stock, you know, where millions of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3163.4s	3163.4	 them a day and that the stock traded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3165.3s	3165.3	 I don't think that we've ever had social media collide with finance like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3169.0s	3169.0	 And it's very reminiscent of our discussions with democracy and journalism,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3174.0s	3174.0	 censorship and politics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3176.5s	3176.5	 We're having weird behaviors because of virality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3180.4s	3180.4	 And I think that seems to be the kind of thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3182.4s	3182.4	 This is the most important learning from this experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3184.8s	3184.8	 Forget about the fiduciary and the governance responsibility of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3187.7s	3187.7	 companies, whether they were good or bad will be resolved over the next couple of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3190.6s	3190.6	 weeks and months, I'm sure, as more information comes to light.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3194.0s	3194.0	 But what's super interesting about what happened this week, and I think it's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3197.3s	3197.3	 most impactful societally over time, is that we're seeing this phenomena
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3203.0s	3203.0	 where individuals in aggregate can believe something to be true and make it true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3209.3s	3209.3	 And we saw this with Tesla.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3212.4s	3212.4	 And I don't think Tesla got this level of notoriety because it was such a longer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3216.9s	3216.9	 play out cycle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3218.1s	3218.1	 But Elon, you know, was not hitting numbers that people thought he was going to hit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3222.8s	3222.8	 margins, production volume, etc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3225.1s	3225.1	 People were shorting the stock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3226.6s	3226.6	 But enough people believed in the story that Elon told about what he wanted the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3230.7s	3230.7	 future to look like, that they bought the stock and that gave him the ability to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3234.5s	3234.5	 shelf offerings, raise additional capital and ultimately build the business and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3238.5s	3238.5	 make it manifest in reality that he said would happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3241.4s	3241.4	 And the same is true of Bitcoin and the same is true of Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3246.3s	3246.3	 And the same is true of storming the capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3249.3s	3249.3	 In all of these cases, there was a belief in something and there was an aggregation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3253.7s	3253.7	 of individuals using social media as a mechanism for sharing and talking and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3258.5s	3258.5	 engaging and creating a collective outcome that wouldn't have happened through a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3263.1s	3263.1	 centralized system or a centralized process and wouldn't have happened in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3267.0s	3267.0	 traditional way where history defines the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3270.1s	3270.1	 And I think that is what's so powerful about what's happening right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3273.9s	3273.9	 And we're seeing it in financial markets, but we're also seeing it play out in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3277.0s	3277.0	 politics and we're seeing it play out in the real world in a remarkable way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3282.5s	3282.5	 And it goes back to this notion that like a stock is worth the underlying value of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3287.5s	3287.5	 the company and that's not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3289.5s	3289.5	 People can dream a stock to be anything as they did with Tesla.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3292.9s	3292.9	 At the time that people were buying Tesla stock, the historical performance of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3296.9s	3296.9	 business was not what hedge funds considered to be a profitable good business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3303.1s	3303.1	 It shouldn't be worth anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3304.5s	3304.5	 But the belief in what it could be is what drove the value of that stock and ultimately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3308.3s	3308.3	 that value enabled that business to become true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3311.7s	3311.7	 And it's amazing to see it happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3313.7s	3313.7	 And I think the counter, which is really what makes this so striking, is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3318.4s	3318.4	 centralized institutions that are trying to block this from happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3321.9s	3321.9	 And the shutting down of Parler and the shutting down of Robinhood Trading are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3327.2s	3327.2	 equivalent from my point of view, or at least equivalent, I think will be perceived to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3332.3s	3332.3	 equivalent broadly, which is if a group of people get together and try and use an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3336.5s	3336.5	 online service to make a change in the world by sharing and talking with one another and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3341.2s	3341.2	 communicating a belief, a collective belief, and that gets yanked away from them, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3345.6s	3345.6	 institution that has the ability to yank it away from them is evil and it will force people to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3350.1s	3350.1	 decentralize and it will enable new ways of trading, new ways of communicating, new ways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3355.0s	3355.0	 of building.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3356.3s	3356.3	 And that's the profound change that I think this decade is going to realize and we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3359.3s	3359.3	 just seeing it start now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3360.3s	3360.3	 I agree that Parler or Wall Street Bets is Parler 2.0, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3366.1s	3366.1	 And what happened?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3367.2s	3367.2	 As soon as Wall Street Bets started, which is the Reddit kids, they started threatening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3373.2s	3373.2	 and they wounded these powerful insiders, these rich hedge fund magnates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3378.2s	3378.2	 What happened?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3378.9s	3378.9	 They started getting banned off of Discord.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3381.7s	3381.7	 They got Discord as a tech company to kick them off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3385.1s	3385.1	 How did that happen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3386.0s	3386.0	 They've been talking on there for months and all of a sudden just magically right at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3390.8s	3390.8	 critical moment where they're also not allowed to trade, their free speech gets cut off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3396.1s	3396.1	 That was deliberate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3397.3s	3397.3	 I'll tell you how it happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3399.1s	3399.1	 I guarantee you what these hedge funds did is they went through the Discord room and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3403.4s	3403.4	 they screenshotted any post that they could plausibly characterize as hate speech or what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3410.6s	3410.6	 have you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3412.4s	3412.4	 And by the way, there's a lot of raunchiness in these rooms, but it's not hate speech and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3416.9s	3416.9	 it's not organized for the purpose of hate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3419.3s	3419.3	 It's organized for the purpose of trades.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3421.9s	3421.9	 But what they do is they weaponize the censorship rules and they go in and they screenshot and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3427.2s	3427.2	 then they give it to Discord and they get these guys kicked off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3430.1s	3430.1	 And this is exactly what I've been talking about with censorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3432.5s	3432.5	 It starts with something you like and then becomes something you don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3435.4s	3435.4	 How many of the people who support these Reddit kids were in favor of deplatforming Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3441.9s	3441.9	 and Parler and now they can see where it goes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3444.6s	3444.6	 This is a slippery slope and we've only had to wait three weeks to see where it goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3448.6s	3448.6	 It goes to the same place, which is when the people in power get threatened, they use these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3453.9s	3453.9	 rules, they weaponize these rules to shut down the outsiders and the upstarts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3457.8s	3457.8	 That is a problem with censorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3459.4s	3459.4	 That is why you cannot let the beast get started.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3461.9s	3461.9	 I completely agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3462.9s	3462.9	 And I think this is exactly why how I think where we came out was, you know, the deplatforming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3468.5s	3468.5	 of Trump made no sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3470.4s	3470.4	 I think the economic censorship of Robin Hood makes no sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3475.1s	3475.1	 Yeah, and you can argue it's the right thing to do with a narrow context.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3479.1s	3479.1	 But when you take the broader point of view of the implications, that's where this becomes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3482.8s	3482.8	 really shaky and really scary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3484.3s	3484.3	 And I think really enables a decentralized movement that is going to be a lot broader
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3489.9s	3489.9	 than than folks are really realizing at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3492.7s	3492.7	 You know, folks don't want to be trading on a system that tells them how to trade and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3497.3s	3497.3	 folks don't want to be communicating on a system that tells them how to communicate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3500.7s	3500.7	 If I gave if I was running Robin Hood, and I said, we're going to have two options, there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3507.9s	3507.9	 going to be a Robin Hood diamond membership, and you pay by the trade and you get these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3513.4s	3513.4	 special features and then the Robin Hood free, you know, you get your data is sold or however
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3519.2s	3519.2	 it works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3520.5s	3520.5	 Would that be a possible solution, I think, to the optics issue here where consumers could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3525.2s	3525.2	 basically pick just like if Facebook or Instagram woke up one day and said, for $9.95 a month,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3529.9s	3529.9	 you can have none of your data, no advertising ad free like Hulu.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3533.3s	3533.3	 Don't you get Hulu premium?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3535.1s	3535.1	 I would.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3535.4s	3535.4	 So here's the thing, J. Cal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3537.5s	3537.5	 I hope your Robin Hood investment is successful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3540.8s	3540.8	 I just think that there are now three moments in Robin Hood's life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3544.0s	3544.0	 There is pre this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3546.8s	3546.8	 And it is what it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3547.7s	3547.7	 It's an 11 billion dollar unicorn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3549.3s	3549.3	 God bless them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3550.9s	3550.9	 Then there was this week where we have to frankly hold people accountable for the economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3556.3s	3556.3	 damage that they created this week because it is measurable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3559.4s	3559.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3559.7s	3559.7	 It's not like missing, you know, it's not like, you know, surge pricing in Uber.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3566.7s	3566.7	 It's not, you know, Facebook growing too fast and allowing, you know, pictures of breasts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3571.1s	3571.1	 getting posted and I'll have to catch up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3572.9s	3572.9	 It's not that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3574.1s	3574.1	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3574.3s	3574.3	 It's not a bunch of like disinformation that we can't really judge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3577.5s	3577.5	 This is very discreetly judgeable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3580.0s	3580.0	 And so in this week, Robin Hood existed as a different company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3582.9s	3582.9	 And I think that there is an implication for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3585.0s	3585.0	 Then to your point, honestly, I agree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3586.6s	3586.6	 It's what happens from here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3588.0s	3588.0	 And I, and they should survive, but they have to learn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3591.4s	3591.4	 And I think what they have to learn is you have to stop the account growth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3595.4s	3595.4	 You have to massively shore up the balance sheet, take the dilution, get the capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3599.0s	3599.0	 you need, because let's be honest, I'm sorry, but nobody's going to show up with five or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3603.0s	3603.0	 10 billion dollars at 11 billion pre.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3605.4s	3605.4	 They'll show up with five or 10 billion dollars at 3 billion pre and they should take the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3608.5s	3608.5	 money and then they should allow the platform to work as intended or at least as perceived
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3614.0s	3614.0	 to be intended to their users.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3615.7s	3615.7	 And then they should reopen to everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3618.5s	3618.5	 What would you do, David, if you were in charge?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3619.9s	3619.9	 And then let's move on to our next topic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3621.3s	3621.3	 Well, I mean, I feel like we've probably talked about Robin Hood enough and I kind of want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3625.3s	3625.3	 to go back to the point that that Freeberg was making just kind of upleveling this a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3629.0s	3629.0	 minute, which is I definitely think this is part of this ongoing populism versus the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3634.7s	3634.7	 elites war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3636.4s	3636.4	 And social media is now the tool that the people use to organize themselves against
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3643.8s	3643.8	 these powerful elites.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3644.9s	3644.9	 It's why we cannot allow censorship because it always comes down to benefit the powerful,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3651.7s	3651.7	 the elites against the people who are trying to organize against them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3654.6s	3654.6	 That was to me one of the biggest takeaways from this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3657.7s	3657.7	 And look, the reason why people are organizing is they're asking the question, what is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3662.5s	3662.5	 societal benefit of these big hedge funds in relation to the enormous sums of money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3668.6s	3668.6	 they make every year?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3669.8s	3669.8	 You go to like the Forbes Rich List or whatever, and every year these guys are taking down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3674.6s	3674.6	 the most money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3675.7s	3675.7	 They're not creating companies, you know, and Tramatha is right, we can't have founder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3679.3s	3679.3	 worship because they make mistakes too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3680.8s	3680.8	 But at least founders are creating things, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3682.7s	3682.7	 They're taking big risks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3684.9s	3684.9	 They're not providing risk capital like what we do, okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3688.8s	3688.8	 We're investors, but we're funding people's, you know, we're taking the risk of writing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3693.9s	3693.9	 checks to start the guy who's got nothing, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3698.7s	3698.7	 Or gal, you know, they, them, it's all good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3701.9s	3701.9	 All of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3703.0s	3703.0	 All of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3704.1s	3704.1	 So, so, but, but, but what exactly is the societal value of these hedge funds?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3711.2s	3711.2	 I know that they provide some price discovery and they provide greater liquidity to markets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3715.9s	3715.9	 but is that really worth them really being the richest players in the game?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3720.6s	3720.6	 It doesn't make any sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3722.1s	3722.1	 And then when they lose, like in 2008, they get bailed out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3727.0s	3727.0	 It makes no sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3727.9s	3727.9	 Something is wrong here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3729.2s	3729.2	 Now, is this a right-wing view, a left-wing view?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3731.0s	3731.0	 It feels to me like there's a political realignment happening here where the left
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3735.3s	3735.3	 and the right, we're all getting on board with this idea and it's got to get fixed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3740.1s	3740.1	 Yeah, this, this might be the legacy of Trump and way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3742.9s	3742.9	 Sachs that he created so much disruption over those four years that now we're actually finding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3748.5s	3748.5	 out where the actual breaking points are in society.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3751.3s	3751.3	 And this is one of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3752.1s	3752.1	 And the healthcare system is one of them and freedom of speech is one of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3755.1s	3755.1	 And we need to address each of these and they're complex, but there is common ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3759.3s	3759.3	 When AOC and tech crews are both agreeing on the same issue with something's going on here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3765.3s	3765.3	 like I think we have to fight the real enemy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3767.0s	3767.0	 Chamath and I should not be fighting over this because I can tell you if Chamath did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3770.3s	3770.3	 the series A in this, he would be backing up Robinhood like this to the end of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3775.3s	3775.3	 end of earth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3776.5s	3776.5	 And that's totally fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3777.4s	3777.4	 And I agree with that position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3778.6s	3778.6	 I just want you to know, number one, I love you with all my heart and I hope you make,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3782.2s	3782.2	 I hope you make hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, but there's a,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3787.2s	3787.2	 it's just like, you know, you were, you just got upset with me because you thought I was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3791.3s	3791.3	 kind of saying that you stumbled into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3793.3s	3793.3	 I didn't mean it that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3794.2s	3794.2	 I was just repeating the way that I heard the story, but something that touches me equally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3798.3s	3798.3	 ferociously is this idea of like the little guy getting run over by some like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3804.9s	3804.9	 objective thing over here that makes a decision that's arbitrary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3807.8s	3807.8	 I would 100% agree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3809.9s	3809.9	 And so like the idea that like, you know, somebody who's on an app all of a sudden gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3814.7s	3814.7	 censored.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3815.4s	3815.4	 Somebody that, you know, makes a post gets canceled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3818.3s	3818.3	 Somebody that all tries to make a trade can't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3821.3s	3821.3	 It feels unfair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3822.5s	3822.5	 It feels that each individual is suffering some pretty deep inequity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3827.3s	3827.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3828.5s	3828.5	 And I can't, I just can't stand that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3830.8s	3830.8	 It really just touches me in a way that tilts me and I get very,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3834.8s	3834.8	 And you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3835.4s	3835.4	 It's interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3836.2s	3836.2	 I think the reason I made the Robinhood investment is because my belief in the underdog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3840.8s	3840.8	 my belief in people's ability to come up from being poor or middle class to middle class
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3846.1s	3846.1	 or affluent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3846.8s	3846.8	 Friedberg, you haven't chimed in yet as we wrap here and then move on to our second topic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3850.7s	3850.7	 I think we're at an hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3852.9s	3852.9	 So it's so I just want to say, you know, we talked about decentralization and, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3860.7s	3860.7	 we all feel the emotional response to the little guy getting screwed by the big guy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3864.7s	3864.7	 that controls the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3866.0s	3866.0	 And we want to fight the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3867.3s	3867.3	 That's the basis of every great movie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3871.0s	3871.0	 The it's worth highlighting though, that decentralization and what I would kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3876.5s	3876.5	 characterize as swarming behavior, uncontrolled swarming behavior can actually have negative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3882.1s	3882.1	 consequences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3882.8s	3882.8	 And there's a reason systems exist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3885.7s	3885.7	 You know, when you put a bunch of people in a room, let's say you put 100 people in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3889.2s	3889.2	 room and every time and someone says the word door and every time you hear the word door,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3892.5s	3892.5	 you're supposed to repeat it within 30 seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3894.9s	3894.9	 The entire room will be like deafening with everyone screaming door door door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3899.4s	3899.4	 Suddenly, everyone will be screaming it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3900.8s	3900.8	 That's a feedback loop that occurs in an uncontrolled social system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3904.5s	3904.5	 And that's what's occurred with GameStop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3906.3s	3906.3	 And it's what occurred with Bitcoin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3908.2s	3908.2	 So there are, as we've seen, remarkable outcomes when you allow systems to operate without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3913.7s	3913.7	 centralized control and without centralized brake pads that kind of slow them down or put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3918.7s	3918.7	 in place some rules and some obligations to how that system operates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3922.3s	3922.3	 The problem with decentralization and this swarming approach to resolution where lots
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3928.5s	3928.5	 of people basically work together individually is you end up with things like cancel culture,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3933.9s	3933.9	 where before a judge and jury determines whether or not someone did something wrong,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3939.3s	3939.3	 the community decides that person should be punished and shuts them down in the real world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3943.4s	3943.4	 and their career and their life is ended and ruined.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3947.7s	3947.7	 And we saw the same with the capital riots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3950.2s	3950.2	 You know, people basically died because of the swarm that occurred where this idea that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3956.3s	3956.3	 there was fraud in the election became an echoing deafening noise for these people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3961.2s	3961.2	 and they swarmed and killed people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3963.8s	3963.8	 And the system by which you can actually have vigorous debate and the system by which you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3968.5s	3968.5	 can actually have controls and processes and judges and juries and trials is what needs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3973.8s	3973.8	 to be improved for this to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3976.3s	3976.3	 Otherwise, people will go to decentralization and you will have a Lord of the Flies moment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3981.2s	3981.2	 that engulfs civil society because the tools are there today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3985.3s	3985.3	 And so centralized systems can work, but they have to adapt and adapt quickly to be fair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3991.7s	3991.7	 and to enable and to not discriminate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3994.7s	3994.7	 Otherwise, we're going to see Lord of the Flies and we're going to see decentralization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=3998.1s	3998.1	 being the solution to getting out of the system that's inhibiting us and we're going to end
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4001.8s	4001.8	 up having really fucking ugly outcomes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4003.7s	4003.7	 There's a psychological term for what you're describing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4005.9s	4005.9	 It's the diffusion of responsibility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4008.5s	4008.5	 And also known as mob behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4010.3s	4010.3	 When a group of people collectively do something, their individual morality can evaporate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4015.8s	4015.8	 And the larger the group and the more intense the behavior, the less responsibility each
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4021.3s	4021.3	 person takes for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4021.9s	4021.9	 So five people on the steps of the Capitol, you know, one person breaks a window, maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4026.1s	4026.1	 somebody breaks it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4026.8s	4026.8	 But once you have 500 or 5,000 and one person breaks a window, now you got a much higher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4031.0s	4031.0	 percentage of people start breaking windows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4032.8s	4032.8	 And that's when tragedies happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4034.4s	4034.4	 Of course, World War II was the diffusion of responsibility with the Nazis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4038.5s	4038.5	 Yeah, you're totally right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4041.0s	4041.0	 Just one quick point and then we can just move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4043.4s	4043.4	 So I think these like viral tools, these social networks, they enable two things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4046.9s	4046.9	 They enable mobs, but they also enable movements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4049.8s	4049.8	 I think the mobs are bad and the movements are good or they can be good depending on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4055.0s	4055.0	 what they're manifest or what their mission is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4057.2s	4057.2	 And so I think we want to enable the movements, but we want to be really careful about the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4060.8s	4060.8	 mobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4061.7s	4061.7	 And, you know, one of the things that's kind of disturbing about Twitter is I generally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4066.0s	4066.0	 find that like the tweets that seem to go the most viral are the ones that are full
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4069.6s	4069.6	 of rage and anger and the ones that are trying to make more nuance points just kind of get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4073.7s	4073.7	 lost.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4074.1s	4074.1	 And so there is something a little bit disturbing about the mob behavior, but the movement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4078.6s	4078.6	 the enabling of these new movements, I think is really powerful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4081.6s	4081.6	 And that's what Wall Street bets was, at least in the early stage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4084.5s	4084.5	 And they did not deserve to get shut down like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4087.3s	4087.3	 Social networks are a collective amygdala.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4089.8s	4089.8	 They are not a collective cerebral cortex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4092.1s	4092.1	 And I think if someone can solve that problem and get people to think about the rational
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4096.3s	4096.3	 objective outcomes in a social way in its engaging a fashion as it is to kind of be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4101.1s	4101.1	 excited by the negative shift that excites the amygdala, you know, it could be really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4105.5s	4105.5	 powerful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4106.0s	4106.0	 But that's probably we're going to need politicians who we're going to need some level of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4109.9s	4109.9	 politician who has some integrity and some expertise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4114.8s	4114.8	 Well, don't you think don't you think politicians with making a transition for you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4119.6s	4119.6	 I was going to say, don't you guys think that what this means is that entrepreneurs now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4123.7s	4123.7	 can really think about decentralization as the key feature, like in many of these markets or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4130.1s	4130.1	 these systems, where we have the centralized authority, we have to move to a much more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4135.3s	4135.3	 decentralized democratized way of doing things, whether it's stock trading, or whether it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4139.3s	4139.3	 health care records, or whether it's, you know, education systems and degrees and accreditation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4144.9s	4144.9	 There has to be a way where you can't be canceled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4147.4s	4147.4	 But with morally and ethically inclined and or legally inclined systems that ensure that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4153.1s	4153.1	 the behavior of that system doesn't run amok.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4156.4s	4156.4	 And, you know, that's really where things can can go can go awry, as we've seen lately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4163.0s	4163.0	 But it's a hard problem to solve it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4164.5s	4164.5	 I don't think we're going to solve it here today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4166.8s	4166.8	 Just a final update.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4168.9s	4168.9	 I don't know if this is exactly correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4170.4s	4170.4	 But I just asked on Twitter, how many shares of GameStop are still short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4174.3s	4174.3	 Apparently, they're still 55 billion shares are so short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4178.1s	4178.1	 Of the 70 million or so share total shares and 47 million in the float.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4183.9s	4183.9	 So something very bad could still happen here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4186.4s	4186.4	 I mean, these shorts have not been covered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4188.8s	4188.8	 So this is going to be an ongoing saga where I think every single platform if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4193.5s	4193.5	 if consumers keep buying these shares, what is the end?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4196.1s	4196.1	 Does anybody have an idea or a prediction on the end game here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4198.9s	4198.9	 And then we'll move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4199.7s	4199.7	 What is the end game?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4201.0s	4201.0	 If another 5 million people buy the shares or 10 million people buy it, and it goes to 1000 or 2000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4206.1s	4206.1	 What happens if GameStop is worth 100 billion dollars?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4209.3s	4209.3	 It's such a great question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4212.7s	4212.7	 Well, can I tell you, Jason, what that means?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4215.4s	4215.4	 There's a great article in the information which Sam Lesson wrote.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4218.5s	4218.5	 I don't know if you guys read it, but it basically said, why did Tesla win?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4222.0s	4222.0	 Now, this is not accurate, but I think his framing is relatively accurate, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4226.5s	4226.5	 people were buying Elon like they would buy a trading card.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4229.8s	4229.8	 That's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4231.4s	4231.4	 And Tesla is a manifestation of Elon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4233.4s	4233.4	 That's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4234.6s	4234.6	 And it actually is so visually, it makes a ton of sense to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4239.0s	4239.0	 Then I think, why have Richard Branson's businesses worked or why is the Jordan brand work?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4243.8s	4243.8	 Chamoff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4246.9s	4246.9	 At a smaller level, yeah, at a smaller level, because we're brands and we have these values
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4250.7s	4250.7	 and people can imbue their collective decision making and support to the person versus the institution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4257.6s	4257.6	 It's a belief.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4258.3s	4258.3	 It's a belief in what that person represents too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4261.2s	4261.2	 Why did MBS buy that freaking painting that wasn't even a Leonardo painting for a billion dollars?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4268.2s	4268.2	 There was some belief there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4270.2s	4270.2	 Is it really worth a billion dollars?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4271.8s	4271.8	 It doesn't matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4272.6s	4272.6	 At the end of the day, most assets are purchased under the premise that I believe the price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4279.4s	4279.4	 will be higher tomorrow than it is today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4281.7s	4281.7	 And if we all believe that, then we will all buy it today and we will all find more people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4286.8s	4286.8	 buying it tomorrow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4287.5s	4287.5	 That's what Bitcoin is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4289.7s	4289.7	 Do we all agree though that GameStop is not Tesla?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4292.6s	4292.6	 I don't agree with your premise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4294.1s	4294.1	 I don't think that stocks necessarily need to be reflective of the underlying business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4299.0s	4299.0	 And that's what's so...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4300.1s	4300.1	 But no, just think about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4301.1s	4301.1	 That's what's so shocking about this week because we've all been taught
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4304.9s	4304.9	 in these frigging economics books and these financial analysis books,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4308.3s	4308.3	 oh, the stock is worth X dollars, discounted cashflow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4311.0s	4311.0	 What company has ever paid out dividends that equal the amount that you paid to buy the frigging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4315.8s	4315.8	 stock unless you lived in 1926?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4318.3s	4318.3	 It hasn't happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4319.5s	4319.5	 So everything we've been taught about DCFs and future cash flows and everything is nonsense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4324.4s	4324.4	 At the end of the day, every stock trades based on the assumption that someone will pay more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4329.3s	4329.3	 for it than I am paying for it today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4331.1s	4331.1	 That is it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4332.0s	4332.0	 That is entirely what a stock is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4334.1s	4334.1	 And so if everyone's belief is completely uncoupled from the underlying asset that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4337.9s	4337.9	 that stock is meant to represent, it doesn't frigging matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4340.9s	4340.9	 And it highlights what's really going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4342.9s	4342.9	 Trading stocks is not investing in businesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4346.5s	4346.5	 Can I say something else on top of this, Jason?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4349.0s	4349.0	 Remember when we were talking about censorship, what was the name of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4352.9s	4352.9	 left podcast that got canceled on Twitter?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4355.0s	4355.0	 Red Scare.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4356.3s	4356.3	 Red Scare.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4358.8s	4358.8	 Is GameStop Red Scare or at the real Donald Trump?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4363.1s	4363.1	 And my point is who the hell are we to decide?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4366.2s	4366.2	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4367.7s	4367.7	 How does it all work?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4368.8s	4368.8	 All three got canceled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4370.1s	4370.1	 All three got canceled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4371.3s	4371.3	 Sax, what's your prediction?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4372.6s	4372.6	 We're sitting here a year from now, full year out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4375.9s	4375.9	 What does GameStop January 2022 look like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4379.3s	4379.3	 What does the stock price look like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4380.4s	4380.4	 What does the business look like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4381.8s	4381.8	 How does this all resolve itself?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4384.2s	4384.2	 I'm not a public stock market trader.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4386.5s	4386.5	 I'm just not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4387.4s	4387.4	 I just feel like it's I'm not a day trader.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4389.9s	4389.9	 I don't buy public stocks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4391.7s	4391.7	 It's just kind of like to me, it's a distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4394.1s	4394.1	 What do you buy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4394.6s	4394.6	 Where will this end?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4396.3s	4396.3	 Just buy Vanguard funds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4397.6s	4397.6	 Like guys, if you're listening to this program and you're wondering where to put your money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4400.7s	4400.7	 just buy Vanguard funds and stop worrying about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4402.9s	4402.9	 What's the index?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4404.8s	4404.8	 Low fees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4405.3s	4405.3	 Index, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4405.9s	4405.9	 Low fee index.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4406.4s	4406.4	 Low fee index.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4406.8s	4406.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4407.8s	4407.8	 Yeah, I mean, if you want to bet specific companies because you get enjoyment out of it, do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4411.0s	4411.0	 But yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4411.8s	4411.8	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4412.2s	4412.2	 So nobody has any idea what happens if it hits a hundred billion or how this ends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4416.1s	4416.1	 So I think that's illustrative of my point is that for somewhat intelligent people who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4421.5s	4421.5	 have some degree of expertise in this area, we have no idea how this ends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4426.4s	4426.4	 But this is the point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4429.0s	4429.0	 It is a collective Ouija board moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4431.8s	4431.8	 Everyone's got their hand on the Ouija board and they're going to craft the sentence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4435.4s	4435.4	 Any one of us individually cannot predict what a collective group of three million plus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4439.6s	4439.6	 people are going to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4440.8s	4440.8	 And we try and struggle and think about the underlying value of a business, which is what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4444.6s	4444.6	 these hedge funds have done historically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4446.4s	4446.4	 But at the end of the day, this thing is going to be worth what the market tells you it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4449.8s	4449.8	 worth and what the market chooses to do, we wouldn't know because we are not the collective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4453.8s	4453.8	 three million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4455.3s	4455.3	 Jason, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4457.7s	4457.7	 So look, Jason, there's two questions, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4459.7s	4459.7	 There's always this question of like, what should the price be and then who gets to decide?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4464.6s	4464.6	 And look, do I personally think GameStop is overvalued?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4467.9s	4467.9	 Yes, of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4468.5s	4468.5	 I think it's going to end very badly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4470.2s	4470.2	 But the question is who gets to decide and is the game going to be rigged by powerful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4475.2s	4475.2	 insiders against outsiders?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4477.4s	4477.4	 It's just like the same question with Parler, okay, which is who gets it's not about which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4481.8s	4481.8	 look, we can say that there are certain views that are bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4484.4s	4484.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4484.8s	4484.8	 But the question is who gets the power to decide that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4487.8s	4487.8	 And it's and that's what that's the thing we have to ask is that second order question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4492.7s	4492.7	 of who has the power to decide?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4494.5s	4494.5	 Is there any outcome?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4495.3s	4495.3	 Amazon got to decide and Robinhood got to decide and the victims were Parler and GameStop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4502.2s	4502.2	 100%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4502.3s	4502.3	 Okay, so this would be a good segue to move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4506.0s	4506.0	 Apparently, we had a discussion on the last episode about running for governor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4512.3s	4512.3	 And I bought the domain name governor Trimoth.com.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4515.6s	4515.6	 I had governor Jason.com.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4517.0s	4517.0	 I got governor Sachs and governor Friedberg.com and I redirected them and you guys own them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4521.6s	4521.6	 and they're redirected to your Twitter handles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4523.8s	4523.8	 And lo and behold, we wake up one day and Trimoth for CA is live.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4531.4s	4531.4	 Trimoth, everybody wants to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4533.0s	4533.0	 Jump the gun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4533.7s	4533.7	 We were going to have a vigorous debate and decide which one of us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4537.0s	4537.0	 Who's going to run but somebody jumped in and I'm not saying other besties might not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4541.1s	4541.1	 jump in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4541.8s	4541.8	 Other besties could jump in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4543.3s	4543.3	 They have domains.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4545.2s	4545.2	 Stay tuned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4546.1s	4546.1	 Stay tuned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4547.3s	4547.3	 Jason, we do not want to split the bestie vote.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4550.3s	4550.3	 I think we got all the besties.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4552.7s	4552.7	 This is the four musketeers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4554.7s	4554.7	 We're all behind Trimoth now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4556.2s	4556.2	 We do not want to split the bestie vote.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4558.2s	4558.2	 Okay, so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4558.6s	4558.6	 Trimoth, it's on you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4559.8s	4559.8	 Tell us what's going to happen now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4561.0s	4561.0	 What's going to happen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4567.3s	4567.3	 Yes, we actually, actually this is, we are going to do an emergency pod and talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4572.7s	4572.7	 exactly that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4573.7s	4573.7	 So if folks want to know, they're going to have to tune in midweek.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4577.0s	4577.0	 But we have to do another talk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4578.6s	4578.6	 Midweek emergency pod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4579.5s	4579.5	 Well, let's talk about the website.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4580.7s	4580.7	 Emergency pod coming up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4582.5s	4582.5	 We'll wrap on this, the website.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4584.2s	4584.2	 You put out a platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4585.0s	4585.0	 What's the reaction been?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4586.0s	4586.0	 And is the reaction been positive enough to do it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4588.5s	4588.5	 These three guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4589.2s	4589.2	 Midweek.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4589.5s	4589.5	 I want to be very clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4590.7s	4590.7	 Midweek, midweek.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4591.4s	4591.4	 But I'll just tell the quick story is three young people, these three amazing guys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4597.0s	4597.0	 just they built it and I just retweeted it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4600.0s	4600.0	 I can say that tens of thousands of people have signed up for updates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4604.7s	4604.7	 I know that much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4607.0s	4607.0	 All these three guys though, here's the, can I just, if I can tell a shout out to these guys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4612.2s	4612.2	 Rahul, Sameer and Amman, all these three guys, they don't live in California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4618.2s	4618.2	 Two did, but had to leave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4620.8s	4620.8	 One wants to move, but can't because he can't afford it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4625.0s	4625.0	 And it's just such a microcosm of like how beautiful California as a place is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4630.1s	4630.1	 And just what people think about when they think about the state is just so, it's so lovely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4634.1s	4634.1	 So for another time, but anyway, shout out to those guys for building the website.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4638.3s	4638.3	 Thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4639.4s	4639.4	 So essentially the entire market has now been driven by a group of all in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4646.6s	4646.6	 of the all in army built a website.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4648.7s	4648.7	 You retweeted it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4650.5s	4650.5	 And that's what this is all about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4652.2s	4652.2	 So there has been no paperwork filed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4653.8s	4653.8	 There is no action committee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4655.3s	4655.3	 However, it has traction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4658.2s	4658.2	 So it makes one wonder, you know, I mean, there may be a shadow cabinet meeting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4662.1s	4662.1	 Maybe not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4662.6s	4662.6	 Maybe there may not be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4664.0s	4664.0	 There may be a shadow cabinet meeting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4666.1s	4666.1	 What is the chances?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4667.7s	4667.7	 Well, I think Chamath by publishing that website just went down the escalator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4677.8s	4677.8	 Golden escalator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4678.8s	4678.8	 He's gone down the escalator and who knows what could happen now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4681.7s	4681.7	 I'll tell you this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4682.4s	4682.4	 I went on, I'll do a plug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4684.5s	4684.5	 I went on Bloomberg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4686.7s	4686.7	 Amazing hit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4688.3s	4688.3	 It's on YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4689.4s	4689.4	 We can put the link in the show notes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4691.4s	4691.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4691.9s	4691.9	 Put the link in the show notes, Nick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4693.6s	4693.6	 People need to watch that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4694.7s	4694.7	 I went through all the ways in which California is hurting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4698.3s	4698.3	 Newsom hasn't done a very good job and I made my case for Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4702.1s	4702.1	 So that's a prelude to what we'll talk about on the next pod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4705.1s	4705.1	 But the amazing thing is the outpouring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4708.0s	4708.0	 I mean, the number of people who have texted me, emailed me and Chamath
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4712.2s	4712.2	 and all of us like there's a groundswell happening now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4715.2s	4715.2	 A hundred percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4716.2s	4716.2	 So, you know, I would say all the fans of the pod who are now behind this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4720.2s	4720.2	 you guys are making it real.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4723.4s	4723.4	 Free bird manifest destiny here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4725.4s	4725.4	 What's going on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4726.0s	4726.0	 Is this another wisdom of the crowds or a mob or a movement?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4732.6s	4732.6	 Who am I to say?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4735.4s	4735.4	 Are you all in as chief science officer?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4738.1s	4738.1	 Will you be our Dr. Fauci?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4740.1s	4740.1	 You know, I think we should have a good debate on our next pod and hear the platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4744.8s	4744.8	 and discuss the platform and, you know, make sure that we all feel like this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4752.6s	4752.6	 where we should be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4754.2s	4754.2	 And I think this is going to take a little bit of time to build.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4759.2s	4759.2	 And I think, you know, the more we kind of build towards it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4762.2s	4762.2	 the more likely we are to have that groundswell that we're going to need.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4765.6s	4765.6	 Well, let's give the all in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4767.7s	4767.7	 I will tell you, it seems pretty likely that this recall effort is going to get the signatures
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4774.1s	4774.1	 it needs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4774.9s	4774.9	 So we can kind of put that in the sand that it's very likely we're going to end up seeing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4778.4s	4778.4	 a recall election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4780.3s	4780.3	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4780.7s	4780.7	 So if people want to participate in recall Gavin Newsom, what do they do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4784.5s	4784.5	 Because that is the first step towards a Chamath governorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4788.2s	4788.2	 You got to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4789.2s	4789.2	 You got to go to rescuecalifornia.org rescuecalifornia.org.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4795.3s	4795.3	 Go to that website, sign the petition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4797.8s	4797.8	 That is the first step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4799.2s	4799.2	 We are very clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4799.9s	4799.9	 We only need a few hundred thousand more signatures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4801.5s	4801.5	 We have one point two million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4803.0s	4803.0	 We need one point five million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4804.5s	4804.5	 Go there, sign up and then go to Chamath's website, which is chamath4ca.com.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4810.2s	4810.2	 And so I'll make one more point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4813.0s	4813.0	 And I think and I made this the other day on that clubhouse that Saxon I did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4816.3s	4816.3	 I think we I made it before you joined.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4819.2s	4819.2	 If you think about the difference between a leader and a manager,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4823.0s	4823.0	 a manager is someone who typically delegates responsibility and authority.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4829.1s	4829.1	 A leader is effective at synthesizing multiple people's points of view and creates an opportunity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4836.2s	4836.2	 defines a vision, defines an objective that is the synthesis of all the people that report to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4842.1s	4842.1	 And for whom he is responsible or she.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4846.2s	4846.2	 And I think what we've seen in California in particular and really across leadership
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4850.8s	4850.8	 positions or governing positions across the country during this pandemic is a failure of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4855.8s	4855.8	 leadership because when times are predictable, if a then b, it is easy to manage and it is easy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4863.0s	4863.0	 to look successful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4864.3s	4864.3	 I delegate down to the person who knows best and they are responsible for the outcome and they do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4868.6s	4868.6	 it well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4869.4s	4869.4	 Great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4869.8s	4869.8	 All I'm doing is pointing to the right person to run something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4873.2s	4873.2	 The pandemic is difficult and it is unpredictable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4876.3s	4876.3	 It requires the synthesis of economic information, social information and health information.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4882.7s	4882.7	 And more often than not, a person who typically acts like a manager points to the person they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4887.7s	4887.7	 think should be in charge under the circumstance to make a decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4890.7s	4890.7	 And that person is not equipped to synthesize the economic and social ramifications of the decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4895.9s	4895.9	 So what we have seen during the pandemic is most often people in a governing position have pointed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4901.0s	4901.0	 to the health officer or the medical person and said, you make the decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4904.7s	4904.7	 And that person does not necessarily account for the social and economic ramifications of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4909.5s	4909.5	 decision they are making.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4910.7s	4910.7	 A health person knows how to save lives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4912.8s	4912.8	 The best way to save lives is to shut everything down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4915.8s	4915.8	 And so the test of leadership during this pandemic has been a test of synthesis and recommending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4922.7s	4922.7	 an action that is associated with the understanding of the social, economic and health implications of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4928.4s	4928.4	 what is going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4929.7s	4929.7	 And that's really where so many governing bodies and individuals have fallen apart during this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4935.6s	4935.6	 pandemic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4936.2s	4936.2	 It's an inability to do that effectively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4938.7s	4938.7	 And I think that is what is needed going forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4941.4s	4941.4	 It is a moment of test.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4943.0s	4943.0	 It is a moment of truth about the difference between a manager and a leader.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4948.3s	4948.3	 And we're seeing across the nation who is what.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4951.4s	4951.4	 And I think it is highlighting why some folks may not be best suited to do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4955.8s	4955.8	 The second thing I'll say, and I know I'm on a little bit of a diatribe, but the second thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4958.7s	4958.7	 I'll say is career.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4960.4s	4960.4	 We've been waiting for your diatribe, by the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4962.2s	4962.2	 It took 19 episodes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4963.3s	4963.3	 Go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4963.7s	4963.7	 Career politicians, I think, simply should not exist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4967.2s	4967.2	 If you go back to the origins of this country, right, having your place in government, and we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4971.8s	4971.8	 talked about this over email, having your place in government was meant to be something that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4975.5s	4975.5	 everyone was supposed to take their turn doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4977.8s	4977.8	 And the people that were sitting in political seats, it was supposed to be the merchant and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4982.6s	4982.6	 the local farmer and the banker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4984.0s	4984.0	 And we were all supposed to take our turn representing our communities, representing our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4988.0s	4988.0	 people in government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4989.2s	4989.2	 And what we've seen is people who have made a career out of being a politician.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4993.1s	4993.1	 And the result of that is that their job depends on them getting reelected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=4997.5s	4997.5	 In order to remain in their career, they have to get reelected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=5000.3s	5000.3	 And they ultimately end up making tradeoffs that don't necessarily represent the best long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=5004.1s	5004.1	 term interest of their community.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=5005.4s	5005.4	 And this is broadly true across nations, across centuries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=5008.7s	5008.7	 But it's particularly acute in the United States, where we've seen such wealth creation

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=5014.5s	5014.5	 And what's happened is when you have career politicians sitting in these seats for so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=5018.8s	5018.8	 long in an environment of severe wealth creation, you end up having governments that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=5022.5s	5022.5	 ineffective and creating systems that fail us.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=5026.0s	5026.0	 And what we need is to have someone go in that's not dependent on the traditional folks that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=5030.8s	5030.8	 get people elected and fund elections and result in reelections.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=5034.9s	5034.9	 We need someone that can go in as an outsider and make a change.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=5043.1s	5043.1	 conversation, is to find those types of folks to come in and lead and be politicians that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=5048.5s	5048.5	 can take a leadership role, synthesize information and not be worried about the re-election cycle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEPSKkkdKQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=122&t=5053.1s	5053.1	 and not have anything to lose related to a career in politics.
