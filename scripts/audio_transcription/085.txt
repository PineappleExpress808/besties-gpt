https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=123.3s	123.3	 Roe v. Wade January 6th and Ukraine all I did a bunch of surveys 50% of people want us to talk about a 50%

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=133.1s	133.1	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=133.6s	133.6	 Do you think we should be surveying the audience to ask him what they want us to talk about because when we started the show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=139.0s	139.0	 We just talked about stuff that we thought was interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=141.0s	141.0	 Sure, and people happen to like it and listen and tune in for it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=144.6s	144.6	 If you end up asking the audience what they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=146.8s	146.8	 Don't you end up becoming like a Fox News or like any other?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=150.0s	150.0	 Yeah, I mean media company where you just ultimately use the feedback loop to drive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=154.6s	154.6	 Yeah, I mean I wouldn't every week of the show. I will tweet like hey anything you want on the docket because sometimes people have good ideas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=161.7s	161.7	 But yeah, certainly you shouldn't base it on like a survey. No, I think it was just like a way to get some feedback
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=167.1s	167.1	 Yeah, we were just yeah, that's how we started was we were just kind of being intellectually honest with each other and curious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=172.2s	172.2	 That's what we were interested in and it worked and if people don't like it, they don't like it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=176.1s	176.1	 I mean, I mean we should the big controversial thing like a like a vote for your topics and that's what we follow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=181.1s	181.1	 Definitely not we shouldn't I think we'll agree on that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=183.1s	183.1	 I think just there is an ongoing debate amongst the audience of what percentage of this show should be politics and when should we talk?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=189.1s	189.1	 About politics and are we doing too much politics? And so I mean, let's start with markets. Let me ask you one more question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=194.6s	194.6	 Do you think our objective should be to grow the audience or should our objective to be talking about the things we want to talk about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=199.1s	199.1	 Yeah, what do you think? I mean, what do you think sex? Yeah, I don't think it's a good idea to pull the audience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=203.2s	203.2	 But we want to talk about I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=206.8s	206.8	 Yeah, well, I think it's good to have an audience otherwise, what are we doing? But yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=212.1s	212.1	 But look at what the audience showed is that half and wanted to talk about those topics roughly and half didn't I suspect that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=218.3s	218.3	 Most topics are gonna be like that, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=220.7s	220.7	 Unless it's not markets and people like I think 80 90 percent of people want to hear us talk about markets and startups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=226.7s	226.7	 Yes, like our course stuff right, David
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=229.3s	229.3	 I'm just saying if your objective function is to maximize your audience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=232.2s	232.2	 You're gonna end up making a tick-tock video of people twerking or something, you know, it's not like the show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=236.8s	236.8	 Did you just volunteer to twerk on the show? I'm not gonna do that now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=242.8s	242.8	 Pretty sure it's from off. I have the video of free bird twerking at all in summit anyway, oh hey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=249.5s	249.5	 All right, let's get started with I think what's going on in crypto because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=254.0s	254.0	 People do want to hear about that and it's been quite stunning a British Virgin Island court ordered the liquidation of three arrows capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=260.7s	260.7	 3 AC after creditors sued the crypto hedge fund for failing to repay its debt. They had 3 billion in assets under management
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=268.4s	268.4	 They had a huge position in the now defunct stablecoin Terra and its token Luna and they were trading on some massive amount of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=277.2s	277.2	 Margin how much and what deposits they were using to do this we will find out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=284.0s	284.0	 Now they're being forced to liquidated to be liquidated 3 AC owed Voyager digital 650 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=290.5s	290.5	 Could not pay it which sent Voyager stock down 60% and caused them to need a bailout from Sam Bankman Fried
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=298.2s	298.2	 which has led to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=300.2s	300.2	 SPF as he's known in the industry bailing out a couple of other major folks in crypto
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=305.3s	305.3	 You provided a 200 million dollar credit line to Voyager digital. This is a Canadian crypto lender. They'll lend you money against your crypto
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=313.3s	313.3	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=314.7s	314.7	 FTX provided a 250 million dollar credit line to block fi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=319.2s	319.2	 FTX is obviously SPF's company and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=322.4s	322.4	 According to early block fi investors the FTX credit line would wipe out all existing shareholders. So we're starting to see the really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=330.8s	330.8	 Onerous term sheets to keep these things alive. This is of course in the face of an entire crypto collapse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=337.2s	337.2	 With many crypto coins seeing what we saw in growth stocks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=343.0s	343.0	 Is this the end of crypto is it gonna rebound again, what are your thoughts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=348.3s	348.3	 Chamath Sachs free Burke who wants to start on crypto?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=350.6s	350.6	 Did you guys see the chart that I posted into the group chat that showed Bitcoin?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=356.7s	356.7	 Activity as a function of year and value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=359.6s	359.6	 Can you just put that up just so that we can look at that together?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=362.1s	362.1	 the crazy thing about this chart when you look at it is and it's pretty obvious is that we are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=367.4s	367.4	 Collectively in one way shape or form basically trading up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=372.1s	372.1	 Ever since 2018 really with all the stimulus because if you look at you know, the mean price of Bitcoin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=378.9s	378.9	 2018 there was a nothing burger, you know what we were talking about was you know a price that was sort of between a few thousand dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=386.5s	386.5	 23,000 10,000 3000, you know, and then all of a sudden when all of this stimulus money hit the market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=392.8s	392.8	 Look what happened to it, but I think something unique also happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=396.9s	396.9	 Which is that people really understood how to run these very complicated off-chain Bitcoin arms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=403.6s	403.6	 And I think we should explain what those are because those are what's behind the three arrows capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=409.4s	409.4	 It's behind, you know, I think Sam had this kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=413.3s	413.3	 Oblique tweet that said, you know, some of these exchanges are actually already in solvent. They're already the walking dead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=419.6s	419.6	 So the first thing to keep in mind is that you know, this is a completely unregulated market, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=424.8s	424.8	 There are no middle maker market makers per se that actually have reporting requirements to any regulatory authority
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=431.1s	431.1	 There aren't any clearing houses. There isn't a way for us to understand systemic risk as it builds in the crypto market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=438.3s	438.3	 So what happened starting in 2018 and 19 is people realized the following things were true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=443.5s	443.5	 It's sort of what we talked about last week. You go and do some crazy round
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=449.2s	449.2	 You you know mark up some phantom equity in a company that company then issues tokens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=456.2s	456.2	 You then list the tokens not on you know, a blockchain per se
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=461.0s	461.0	 obviously, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=462.6s	462.6	 In a place where trades can happen off-chain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=465.9s	465.9	 Right, and there's a bunch of exchanges where these things happen off-chain because it's one, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=471.7s	471.7	 company and then they have a bunch of segregated sub accounts and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=475.4s	475.4	 What happens is when these things initially get listed retail goes crazy. The price goes up folks basically dump on retail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=482.7s	482.7	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=484.1s	484.1	 You know you spin that loop as fast as you can and you can extract an enormous amount of money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=489.8s	489.8	 Along the way all these things like defy all of a sudden popped out of nowhere and it's like hey you can earn 15 16 17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=496.0s	496.0	 18 percent just deposit the Bitcoin and so folks would deposit Bitcoin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=500.8s	500.8	 But then what would happen is like the places where those deposits were held would then need to obviously find places to make that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=507.8s	507.8	 11 12 or 13 percent and so then they would go off-chain to some other random person who was offering to pay them even more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=514.3s	514.3	 Than that and they would try to arb the difference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=517.1s	517.1	 But it all catches up with you because when something like a Terra goes to zero all the Bitcoin that was used to basically, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=525.7s	525.7	 Run that defy process around Terra
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=529.5s	529.5	 vanishes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=530.8s	530.8	 you know, and then all of a sudden you the lender are like hey, can I have my Bitcoin back and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=536.3s	536.3	 The brokers like well, actually I don't have it. I lent it to somebody else. Let me ask that someone else and they're like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=542.1s	542.1	 I'm sorry. I don't have it but I have these Terra coins, you know, because I was running some arm and now it went to zero and that's essentially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=549.8s	549.8	 What we're seeing right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=551.2s	551.2	 So we have two big problems and then I think we have a third that's kind of funny
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=555.0s	555.0	 The first big problem is like obviously in the absence of any regulatory oversight. This stuff is gonna happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=560.5s	560.5	 Systemic risks are gonna build up. That's what we're facing right now is an enormous amount of systemic risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=566.5s	566.5	 largely around Bitcoin a bunch of this money I think has been essentially just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=572.2s	572.2	 vaporized and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=574.0s	574.0	 So all these people that try to find their deposits, especially in custodial accounts in off-chain brokers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=582.9s	582.9	 May be sol at some point and I think that's just gonna be a huge shit show if that actually happens and to be clear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=589.5s	589.5	 She mouth they don't have the keys to their own Bitcoin. They gave money to a custodial account
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=595.1s	595.1	 they then did this lending went out to get them to 15% and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=600.0s	600.0	 They don't have any recourse here. They can't get there. Well, look at this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=605.6s	605.6	 Owner's anybody a wallet and own the keys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=607.7s	607.7	 Does anybody have recourse to this three arrows capital and all of this other interrelated parties that are now, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=614.1s	614.1	 Gone completely bankrupt because of this scam. The answer is absolutely not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=619.0s	619.0	 So that that's the first problem you have absolutely zero oversight, which means systemic risk has been built up in the system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=625.7s	625.7	 The second thing is that exactly what you just said Jason is that people don't even understand chain of custody here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=632.0s	632.0	 Which is that you thought that you owned this Bitcoin?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=634.4s	634.4	 It turns out you actually may not actually own them at all. You thought that you were properly lending them out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=638.8s	638.8	 You actually don't there is no enforceable contract it turns out and so I think that's gonna be an entire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=645.2s	645.2	 Set of different legal issues that are now going to come to the service because people who actually legitimately lent this stuff out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=651.8s	651.8	 For example, like if you short a stock and you go and borrow stock from any one of us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=656.2s	656.2	 They're really tight guardrails, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=657.9s	657.9	 If you wanted to go and put a credit derivative swap on against debt, there's a central clearinghouse that makes sure you're not over levered
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=664.5s	664.5	 You know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=665.1s	665.1	 You have to go and get audited by a bank to even get in a the kind of account that allows you to put these derivatives on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=670.5s	670.5	 None of that was possible in crypto and then the last thing which I think is kind of funny is that we've had to listen to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=677.3s	677.3	 Every millennial and Gen Z market observer in crypto
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=681.4s	681.4	 Tout how this is not like boomers and they turned out to be the same same same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=685.8s	685.8	 I mean, this is the fuck think of all it's like all of the times you've had to hear how it's so different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=692.0s	692.0	 It turns out it is entirely the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=695.0s	695.0	 Entirely entirely. It's in fact worse. The custodian issue is definitely a major one Saks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=700.0s	700.0	 What do you think is happening in crypto right now? The price is obviously going down a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=704.6s	704.6	 The price is obviously going down a lot. I don't really have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=708.9s	708.9	 New point of view on it. I'm mainly pissed off that SPF is trying to raise my taxes in, California
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=715.4s	715.4	 Explain that same Bankman Friede. He runs FTX and his company he lives in the Bahamas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=722.4s	722.4	 Okay, and there are probably reasons for that related to liability or taxes or something like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=726.9s	726.9	 Can you tell us what at what FTX does they're like a coin based competitor?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=730.1s	730.1	 But they obviously think it's beneficial to be offshore and not under US jurisdiction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=734.1s	734.1	 And they're very profitable, right? So yeah, supposedly they're super profitable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=738.3s	738.3	 I mean he's worth like ten or fifteen billion dollars. This is my understanding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=743.4s	743.4	 So he's been very successful at this. I don't know why they're in the Bahamas. I think either they're in there for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=748.9s	748.9	 Securities regulation reasons or for tax reasons, but it's one of those two in any event
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=753.4s	753.4	 He doesn't live in California and yet he is sponsoring a ballot initiative here that would add a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=761.0s	761.0	 0.75 percent tax on incomes over five million to finance a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=765.7s	765.7	 Pandemic Prevention Institute of his design. He's doing this with Dustin Moskovitz another billionaire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=772.1s	772.1	 He doesn't know what to do with his money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=773.1s	773.1	 He was may remember that Dustin was the guy funding Chase Abudin in any event
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=777.8s	777.8	 This would be this pandemic prevention is to be governed by an unaccountable board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=783.5s	783.5	 As opposed to something like the University of California
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=785.8s	785.8	 This is like them using the ballot initiative system to fund their pet philanthropic projects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=792.0s	792.0	 I mean, there's really no need for this. I mean, first of all, this is something that should be done federally. Yeah, exactly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=796.9s	796.9	 It's well first of all, it's looking in the rear-view mirror in terms of like a budgetary priority
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=801.5s	801.5	 But even if you believe this was a priority, I don't know why it'd be the responsibility of California
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=806.7s	806.7	 Taxpayers exclusively and even if it was you'd want to do it under say the UC system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=811.7s	811.7	 Some sort of accountable board as opposed to having a report to you know, Sam and Dustin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=817.3s	817.3	 So it makes no sense and this is really gonna hurt the California tax base because if you start raising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=823.9s	823.9	 taxes on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=825.9s	825.9	 You know California millionaires more of them are gonna leave the state and then that tax revenue leaves the state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=831.8s	831.8	 And so it actually hurts the general budget and that's why you know, California teachers Association
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=837.4s	837.4	 You know California teachers Association for example opposes this is because they know that this is gonna have a negative impact on core services
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=845.3s	845.3	 What is but what's offensive to me is I mean, so first of all, this is just a stupid idea in like every possible way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=852.2s	852.2	 But what is a guy who lives in the Bahamas doing funding ballot initiatives in California to raise our taxes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=858.3s	858.3	 Thereby worsening the California fiscal situation to fund his pet philanthropic projects if you're worth 10 billion just fund it on your own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=865.7s	865.7	 You know do it through your family foundation. I don't know why you need to raise the taxes on all of us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=871.7s	871.7	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=872.9s	872.9	 That's very bizarre. I think why is he giving a simple answer is because I think it helps curry favor with politicians that he needs for other things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=882.2s	882.2	 You would do it that's why I would do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=884.4s	884.4	 This is currying negative favor because first of all every millionaire in California should be up in arms over this but even I'd say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=893.2s	893.2	 Liberal game plan. Yeah, I mean but I'd say even liberal politicians and interest groups in California
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=900.8s	900.8	 like the like the teacher Association don't want this because the money is not going to a cause they support and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=907.5s	907.5	 It will probably it will almost certainly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=910.5s	910.5	 Drive down the state's tax base, right? Because people on the margins are gonna leave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=916.1s	916.1	 We already have the highest taxes in the nation. We're at what like 13 point 3% for the top end
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=921.9s	921.9	 We have a hundred billion dollar surplus for a reason all these IPOs all of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=925.5s	925.5	 Venture capitalists CEOs and rank-and-file tech workers are just paying massive amounts of tax here and they're leaving right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=932.7s	932.7	 But that's highly levered to capital gains, right? And so last year we had a boom market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=937.3s	937.3	 We now know in hindsight that it was inflated that was all driven by this liquidity bubble
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=942.4s	942.4	 So do you think that's gonna be the case this year?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=944.9s	944.9	 I think would you for a huge budget shortfall next year because there's gonna be no capital gains
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=950.0s	950.0	 Hold on to that hundred billion for sure. The California tax base is highly leveraged to this boom bus cycle and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=956.8s	956.8	 Driving the top earners out of the state is only gonna worsen that impact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=960.9s	960.9	 So, you know, but again, I question why is a guy in the behind? It'd be one thing if it was just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=966.5s	966.5	 Dustin doing it I guess but I don't understand why Sam's taking the lead when he's not even a California taxpayer because I think he's a very sophisticated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=975.8s	975.8	 Player in not just crypto, but frankly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=980.9s	980.9	 Regulated and unregulated finance and look he I think he spends a lot of money in DC as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=986.8s	986.8	 And I think that he has a very thoughtful game plan and then you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=990.8s	990.8	 When you look at who his parents are his parents are really really smart thoughtful people as well two law professors at Stanford
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=997.3s	997.3	 And so I suspect not knowing and having spoken to him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1002.3s	1002.3	 That I think that there's a really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1005.0s	1005.0	 Specific strategy that these guys have around who they need to influence and what they care about and then willing to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1014.0s	1014.0	 as a pass-through fund those things in order to curate the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1017.6s	1017.6	 You know influence that he needs for the things that he cares about and I suspect that it's that kind of horse trading
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1022.2s	1022.2	 Which is I think it's pretty typical in US politics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1026.2s	1026.2	 The question though is what will happen if FTX?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1030.5s	1030.5	 Has to really talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1032.5s	1032.5	 You know everything that's actually happening in crypto crypto, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1035.6s	1035.6	 I'm sure that FTX could do a lot to help understand a lot of this off-chain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1040.3s	1040.3	 activity some of the you know, especially the stuff that's really in the gray
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1044.4s	1044.4	 Especially the stuff that's gonna come to light over the next few years is I mean you have to understand guys like, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1050.1s	1050.1	 We've torched two trillion dollars and it's not of institutional capital, you know, this is overwhelmingly retail capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1056.0s	1056.0	 All of this is going to inspire a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1060.1s	1060.1	 District attorneys and DOJ activity the discovery is going to be bonkers and it's all going to be regulated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1066.2s	1066.2	 To the point of in which it kills a lot of the opportunity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1070.3s	1070.3	 I think this is going to become the most regulated space
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1073.2s	1073.2	 well, I don't know I mean I if the goal here was to curry favor then I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1077.9s	1077.9	 Sam must think there's not gonna be a red wave in November because I don't think Republican politicians are gonna look very favorably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1084.3s	1084.3	 On a guy who's using his money to raise taxes in a state. He doesn't even live
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1090.3s	1090.3	 All right. Well, let's move back to the crypto piece
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1095.6s	1095.6	 That's the bigger thing not a few million dollars of lobbying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1098.9s	1098.9	 At this point with this many retail investors. Well, actually, let me let me start with this Friedberg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1103.6s	1103.6	 Is there a real technology here and how much of what we've just witnessed with this crypto collapse and the crypto boom-bust cycle?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1110.3s	1110.3	 How much is this based on what you would perceive as real technology that is going to advance the human species forward and how much of this was hype if you were to put a percentage on it, you know, trillions of dollars in assets, you know, created and then wiped out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1125.7s	1125.7	 How much of this was actually real technology? How much of it was complete utter waste of fucking time and a grift. I'm no crypto expert and I've not been an investor in cryptocurrencies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1137.5s	1137.5	 I read the original Bitcoin white paper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1141.6s	1141.6	 Makes sense Bitcoin itself to me makes sense as a potential
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1148.1s	1148.1	 Initially was kind of interesting as a potential alternative currency, but the transaction fees were very high
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1153.2s	1153.2	 And so it never really seemed to make sense as a replacement for traditional financial networks until those transaction fees dropped below those of the traditional financial networks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1163.1s	1163.1	 And the biggest concern I've always had, which I've mentioned multiple times on the show is that whenever anyone talks about a quote cryptocurrency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1174.7s	1174.7	 They talk about the price of it in dollars. And if it really is meant to be an alternative to the US dollar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1182.3s	1182.3	 Why are you talking about it in the price of US dollars and it's up and it's down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1186.9s	1186.9	 Relative to dollars and that implies ultimately that the intention would be to transact back to US dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1193.6s	1193.6	 Which implies that the intent is not to be a replacement for the US dollar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1198.6s	1198.6	 Which was a lot of the early prognostication of bitcoin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1203.1s	1203.1	 Was it was going to be a replacement for the US dollar. It's going to be an alternative to traditional monetary systems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1208.7s	1208.7	 But ultimately if you're just measuring this in dollars and it's up and it's down everyone's freaking out every day about cryptos up cryptos down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1215.1s	1215.1	 That means it really is more like a security
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1217.6s	1217.6	 Except securities definitionally are supposed to have a secured interest in some underlying set of assets and there's no underlying asset
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1224.8s	1224.8	 It's not actually a security because it doesn't provide you a security interest in anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1228.7s	1228.7	 So it is effectively a bet on some systems of computers that are meant to facilitate some set of activities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1235.8s	1235.8	 That you know, ultimately people really only seem to value in US dollars, so um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1242.3s	1242.3	 So, I don't know. I mean like where does it all go?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1244.6s	1244.6	 It seems like I mentioned at our predictions episode last year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1248.5s	1248.5	 That all of these smaller things are going to get blown out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1251.4s	1251.4	 These quote unquote cryptocurrencies, even though many of them don't really act like a currency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1255.9s	1255.9	 And you know, maybe bitcoin itself persists and it seems to me like that's always going to have good staying power
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1261.5s	1261.5	 As an observer, i'm not a participant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1264.5s	1264.5	 And uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1265.9s	1265.9	 You know anytime someone telling you something's in dollars and it's going up and it's going down and you're betting on whether it's going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1270.3s	1270.3	 Go up or go down and your intention is to transact back to dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1274.2s	1274.2	 You know and and there's no one there's these have been securities the whole time. This is the problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1279.2s	1279.2	 This is the problem. I have with it. This has been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1281.7s	1281.7	 You know a shadow securities stack that was created in parallel to the existing one with a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1288.2s	1288.2	 You know oversight and what did we think would happen if you created a global casino with no rules
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1295.7s	1295.7	 Other securities have an underlying interest in something this has an underlying sure interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1300.2s	1300.2	 In some line on the blockchain of that particular network
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1304.0s	1304.0	 That's exactly what it has. Yeah, it's a secured interest in a line of code in on a distributed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1310.3s	1310.3	 It's it's it has a secure a bitcoin has a legitimate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1315.9s	1315.9	 Uh non-fungible entry in a blockchain that says it and only it represents that thing and I think that that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1322.4s	1322.4	 You know is is I guess that the the link security interest some may call it tenuous, but I mean I tend to think at this point bitcoin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1331.7s	1331.7	 Probably has to be regulated like a security even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1335.4s	1335.4	 even if it is not and it's more of a commodity only because of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1339.1s	1339.1	 the volume and the sheer size of both the market and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1343.2s	1343.2	 The potential fallout is the way you're saying it right the potential fallout when things go off the rails is so great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1348.7s	1348.7	 You kind of need to have some rails
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1350.7s	1350.7	 Yeah, I mean, I mean like like again as i've said like look if you're a a market participant trying to trade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1356.9s	1356.9	 You know very sophisticated, you know derivatives of any kind for example in the credit markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1361.9s	1361.9	 We have to go and we create these things called isda's they're called isdas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1366.7s	1366.7	 you know, and it's basically a kind of an account that allows us to go and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1370.5s	1370.5	 You know take risk in some of these very esoteric markets, but the the underlying principle around that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1377.2s	1377.2	 Is a common set of parameters a clearing house the ability to monitor risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1381.8s	1381.8	 None of those things exist here and I think that's really what folks have to solve for now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1386.7s	1386.7	 secondarily is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1388.5s	1388.5	 What were all these kind of like shadow activities?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1391.5s	1391.5	 You know it just it turned you know, it seemed too good to be true when you would hear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1396.3s	1396.3	 Wow, this d5 protocol will yield you 24% and you're just like who was paying the 24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1401.8s	1401.8	 It never made sense really but then none of us really questioned it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1405.4s	1405.4	 You know, I you know, I had people on this week at startups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1407.4s	1407.4	 I questioned it all the time and they could never explain it to me and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1410.7s	1410.7	 Now the explanation was well, we were giving you we were giving short-term loans to other people who basically wanted a margin loan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1417.0s	1417.0	 You know, they want to they don't want they want to hold all their bitcoin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1419.9s	1419.9	 But that was only four or five percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1421.6s	1421.6	 What they were also doing was giving you tokens in some other cryptocurrencies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1426.8s	1426.8	 That they were basically originating so they basically were like we'll give you four percent on your bitcoin loan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1432.1s	1432.1	 Somebody else will pay that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1433.7s	1433.7	 You'll pay that but then the other 11 percent is coming from some tokens. We're giving you that actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1440.2s	1440.2	 You know you have to airline miles. We have to give you airline miles. We have to answer a really important question if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1446.8s	1446.8	 We've we you know look the the markets have incinerated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1452.1s	1452.1	 Many trillions of dollars I just saw like for example, there was 1.7 trillion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1456.3s	1456.3	 You know that was just torched in etfs alone just in the since the beginning of this year, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1462.8s	1462.8	 We've done that or more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1464.7s	1464.7	 uh in the crypto side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1467.1s	1467.1	 We've done that or more on public equities, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1469.9s	1469.9	 We're probably going to do that or more in other markets, but every other market is regulated and there's a full accounting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1476.1s	1476.1	 Of the pnls on the dollars that are won and the dollars that are lost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1480.0s	1480.0	 And here some folks have just you know, basically escaped with billions and billions and billions of dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1487.2s	1487.2	 And the bag holder is just you know, uh a retail investor. So the real question is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1492.7s	1492.7	 Are regulators going to actually care to try to do something because oh, yeah the level of grift that's happened in this market is extreme
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1501.3s	1501.3	 And especially when especially when everybody was telling you no this time is different. This market is completely different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1508.3s	1508.3	 It's transparent. It's on chain. You can see every and it turns out actually most of it was not on chain. It was off chain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1515.4s	1515.4	 And they were using they were using this hey have fun being poor this like psyops to get you to participate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1521.9s	1521.9	 Okay boomer, you don't get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1524.5s	1524.5	 Gensler I was talking to kramer on cnbc. Here's the quote some like bitcoin and that's the only one jim
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1529.8s	1529.8	 I'm going to say because i'm not going to talk about any of those these tokens that my predecessors and others have said are a commodity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1538.6s	1538.6	 And then he said many of these crypto financial assets have the key attributes of a security aside from bitcoin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1545.1s	1545.1	 He believes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1546.3s	1546.3	 You know like these things are securities and that makes sense because 99 of people buying them sax were buying them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1552.1s	1552.1	 Because they wanted to see them appreciate they were never using these as utility tokens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1555.5s	1555.5	 They were buying them to you know, I see them appreciate and to flip them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1559.2s	1559.2	 So what do you think sax is there is there when we look back on this whole mess in 10 years?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1563.7s	1563.7	 Is it going to be like the dot-com era where we're like, yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1565.7s	1565.7	 I got overheated but amazon and google came out of it or are we going to look at it and go?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1569.5s	1569.5	 Well, that was tulip season
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1571.9s	1571.9	 Well, I I think there is a future technology platform here with crypto
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1577.5s	1577.5	 But I mean i've been saying this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1579.5s	1579.5	 For the last year that just because there's a future technology platform doesn't tell you what the pricing should be and the price action got decoupled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1587.7s	1587.7	 From the level of progress in the space
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1590.3s	1590.3	 You know, you should always be looking at what is the real?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1593.4s	1593.4	 usage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1594.5s	1594.5	 use cases
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1596.1s	1596.1	 customers revenue things like that and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1599.5s	1599.5	 People stop doing that and I think part of the reason why the narrative was so powerful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1604.1s	1604.1	 If you go back to last year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1606.9s	1606.9	 Then the chart that shimaz showed about the the increase in the price of bitcoin, which is really the root of everything, right? Because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1613.8s	1613.8	 You know first bitcoin appreciates and then if you think about it like ethereum is ethereum's market cap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1620.8s	1620.8	 Is like a derivative of of the bitcoin market cap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1623.5s	1623.5	 It's been roughly 40%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1625.6s	1625.6	 And then the altcoins sort of get the market cap the altcoins is sort of derivative off ethereum's market cap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1631.5s	1631.5	 So the whole thing kind of moved up in in sync and the reason why bitcoin moved up so much is that as the fed kept printing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1639.1s	1639.1	 More and more money you had fans of bitcoin saying look the fed is debasing the us dollar. We're going to need an alternative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1646.8s	1646.8	 Currency that was a powerful narrative that the fed seemed to be vindicating and there was a positive feedback loop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1653.2s	1653.2	 Which is the more the fed debased the currency?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1656.8s	1656.8	 the more that the price of bitcoin went up now the reason the price went up was not because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1662.7s	1662.7	 They were debasing the currency. It was because they were creating so much liquidity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1666.5s	1666.5	 That that it created a liquidity effect that then drove up the price then so so consumers had money that they could buy bitcoin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1673.7s	1673.7	 Because they were there was more money in the system. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1675.7s	1675.7	 You saw more buyers a bitcoin exactly what happened they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1679.6s	1679.6	 I mean all of this idiotic narrative. Sorry go ahead sex. Yeah, you saw an increase in speculative investments across the board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1686.0s	1686.0	 Including but not limited to crypto. So again, you know when the fed prints too much money it creates asset bubbles, but there's a powerful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1694.1s	1694.1	 Reinforcement because as the fed was printing bitcoin and supporters of bitcoin had a really great explanation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1700.2s	1700.2	 For why bitcoin was going up, which is they're destroying the us dollar. We're going to need an alternative soon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1705.3s	1705.3	 Now I think in the very very long term could bitcoin be a non-fiat currency. Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1711.1s	1711.1	 I mean, I actually think the technology works you could create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1714.7s	1714.7	 a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1715.5s	1715.5	 A new kind of currency that's backed by math and by cryptography as opposed to fiat government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1721.8s	1721.8	 But that could take a really long time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1724.0s	1724.0	 I mean that could be decades in the future and but what happened is the market started thinking well that's going to happen soon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1730.5s	1730.5	 And that's where it just got ahead of itself. That was the tulip part of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1733.9s	1733.9	 Yeah, I think that I think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1735.8s	1735.8	 they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1737.0s	1737.0	 Found all of these words, you know written in these economic textbooks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1741.4s	1741.4	 That allowed them frankly to justify what a lot of people were doing in a lot of other markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1745.3s	1745.3	 Which is just straight up speculation because the money printer was going burr
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1750.2s	1750.2	 And you know if the if you look at this 92 correlation to the equity markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1754.5s	1754.5	 I suspect in bitcoin and crypto is probably closer to the even 100 percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1760.3s	1760.3	 Because it really was the furthest out on the risk curve and it just made the most sense when you thought money was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1765.7s	1765.7	 You know effectively infinitely going to be available to just buy the riskiest risk assets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1771.1s	1771.1	 Think about the friction taken out of this jamath. You could buy these, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1776.0s	1776.0	 Cryptocurrencies so easily you could trade them so easily you could create one so easily people were popping up forks of these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1782.8s	1782.8	 So in a way what technology has done over the last 30 or 40 years?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1787.2s	1787.2	 From cloud computing to software to open source has made it very easy to pop up a startup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1792.5s	1792.5	 Well, you could pop up a currency and then you could get an incredible reward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1797.6s	1797.6	 And you get this incredible reward before you actually make a product for consumers and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1803.2s	1803.2	 And absolutely zero rules and oversight no oversight. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1808.6s	1808.6	 The feature that was touted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1811.6s	1811.6	 Was actually the first one to get thrown away, which was transparency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1815.2s	1815.2	 Yeah, when all of this activity was actually happening off chain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1818.8s	1818.8	 This is why you have this systemic risk issue now when sam is saying some of these exchanges are actually in solvent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1826.1s	1826.1	 What he's saying is well that exchange has one master
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1830.6s	1830.6	 wallet address
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1832.6s	1832.6	 Every time you open an account and transact on such exchange
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1836.2s	1836.2	 You're actually just transferring between a database entry inside of that company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1841.7s	1841.7	 And so it may look like it is fine, but it is actually not fine. That's what he's claiming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1848.0s	1848.0	 This is the problem with all of this. So all of this activity, you know built on these principles of openness and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1854.8s	1854.8	 You know defensibility and you know, you you can't inflate it and you know devalue it and debase it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1861.2s	1861.2	 Turned out to not even matter because the fundamental principle that would allow us to verify all of that was violated right from the get-go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1867.5s	1867.5	 Which was transparency all of it is happening in the dark
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1870.8s	1870.8	 Most of this stuff is happening off chain. And if you think that you know, it's okay to torch a trillion dollars of equities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1877.4s	1877.4	 Well, at least there's rules on the equity side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1880.8s	1880.8	 But to torch two and a half trillion dollars in crypto where there are no rules
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1885.3s	1885.3	 It'll be really you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1886.4s	1886.4	 It'll be a very telling sign to see if these folks get their act together and but meaning regulators and politicians and do something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1893.1s	1893.1	 Well, then we made this crazy hybrid where we had the venture community
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1896.4s	1896.4	 And i'm not going to talk about any specific firm here and to be clear, you know, nobody knows exactly what's happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1901.9s	1901.9	 But you had coins you can't know by the way, you can't know because it was happening off chain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1908.0s	1908.0	 Exactly. So somebody would originate a coin and I was you know offered these deals and you would as a venture capitals be buying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1913.8s	1913.8	 Some equity in a company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1915.3s	1915.3	 And then some amount of tokens would be created before the token was released to the public or before anybody had insights into this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1921.2s	1921.2	 These tokens were swapping around everybody had different rights. Some people could sell early
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1925.2s	1925.2	 Some people could never sell and it was as if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1928.8s	1928.8	 you know you took the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1930.8s	1930.8	 Process of going public and you gave that to a seed stage or a series a company before they launched their product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1937.5s	1937.5	 So you're taking a company public essentially before they go if you if you subpoena, you know, they launch their product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1943.9s	1943.9	 If you subpoena the exchanges
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1946.0s	1946.0	 All of this gets turned over because the exchanges are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1950.0s	1950.0	 The honeypot of off-chain activity. Yeah, so and that's what's going to happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1954.1s	1954.1	 I think in all of this and it's going to be really funky. This is and what's terrible about this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1958.9s	1958.9	 This is why the accreditation laws
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1961.0s	1961.0	 Exist is like only sophisticated people top six percent of americans are allowed to participate in private companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1966.5s	1966.5	 And what did we do? We allowed a hundred percent of people on the globe to participate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1971.4s	1971.4	 Backed by pure math back that less than a thousand people in the world actually understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1976.8s	1976.8	 That makes it go wrong. What could go wrong? You cannot buy a stock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1981.2s	1981.2	 But you can buy this cryptographically secure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1984.0s	1984.0	 You're not allowed to buy a share of linkedin or uber or airbnb even though you stated in airbnb
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1988.9s	1988.9	 We're an airbnb host. You're too stupid to buy airbnb shares when it's private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1993.2s	1993.2	 But you can buy this cryptocurrency that doesn't even have a product in market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=1997.6s	1997.6	 And and here's this white paper that has you know university level pure math as the explanation of why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2003.5s	2003.5	 If nothing can go wrong and you try it turns out again because nobody actually understood in the first place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2009.9s	2009.9	 This is going to be a decade of discovery if you look at that price chart what it really means is like again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2015.2s	2015.2	 You know we talked about this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2017.0s	2017.0	 If the equity markets have to rebase and get all this qt out of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2021.9s	2021.9	 Yeah, right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2022.8s	2022.8	 And then you have to rebase for earnings if you believe you're in a recession and then you have to rebase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2027.3s	2027.3	 For margins if you believe that there's rampant inflation those three things have to happen in the equity markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2032.4s	2032.4	 We're in the midst of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2033.7s	2033.7	 Yeah, but that also has to happen on the crypto markets in the crypto markets and if you look at that chart
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2038.9s	2038.9	 What it really tells you is that the baseline price of bitcoin where things seemed, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2043.2s	2043.2	 Where rational supply and demand were meeting each other before all these, you know five ten thousand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2048.9s	2048.9	 Thirty five hundred to five thousand. Yeah, I would say about five thousand still seventy five percent for me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2054.4s	2054.4	 Yeah, it's twenty thousand now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2055.3s	2055.3	 So yeah, we got we got we could we have ways to go one thing that I thought was an interesting sign of potentially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2060.7s	2060.7	 bouncing along the bottom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2062.6s	2062.6	 Zendesk has agreed to be acquired by an investor group in an all cash transaction. They're basically going private here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2068.5s	2068.5	 For around ten point two billion if you don't know zendesk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2072.3s	2072.3	 It's a help desk software company. It's a sass software company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2075.7s	2075.7	 They turned down a similar acquisition of 17 billion earlier this year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2078.8s	2078.8	 Their market cap is 9.1 billion in the public markets. It's gone up obviously since this announced this was announced but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2086.2s	2086.2	 They have a billion three in revenue. They're up 30 percent year over year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2090.8s	2090.8	 So this is a strong company, but the acquisition price is seven point seven times their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2095.9s	2095.9	 2021 multiple sorry. Did you say they're up 30 percent?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2100.1s	2100.1	 Oh the revenue's up 30 revenues up 30 percent year over year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2103.8s	2103.8	 They have 1.5 billion dollars in cash and securities that are you know marketable securities. So they're cash rich
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2110.1s	2110.1	 Small loss 223 million for the year in 2021. So they have six years of runway if nothing were to change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2116.8s	2116.8	 Yeah, what do you make of this sax is why would they do this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2121.2s	2121.2	 They don't have to so and is this to you like the sign of a bottom if we start seeing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2126.4s	2126.4	 A bunch of these companies that went public that are seemingly strong start to go private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2131.7s	2131.7	 And to go maybe clean up their balance sheet and go public again in three years. What's going on here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2136.6s	2136.6	 Well, I mean this isn't a horrible outcome. By the way, I mean I remember we shared
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2140.8s	2140.8	 Uh when I was doing yammer a decade ago, we shared a floor in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2145.1s	2145.1	 Our an office building at 410 townsend with um with zendesk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2149.7s	2149.7	 And they launched a tech crunch 50. Yeah, yeah, exactly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2152.4s	2152.4	 So we had I think 5 000 square feet and they had the other 5 000 square feet and we were in a standoff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2156.2s	2156.2	 Both of us were expanding and we needed the other half of the floor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2160.4s	2160.4	 And it was like who had moved first basically and anyway, they ended up moving and we took over their space
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2165.9s	2165.9	 But so I mean look, this is a company that you know was worth 100 million bucks 10 years ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2171.2s	2171.2	 So whatever it was, I mean they were still you know, they were very early stage. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2175.6s	2175.6	 This is still a great outcome so they've taken the 17 billion sure with 2020 hindsight that would have been better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2180.9s	2180.9	 But look you're seeing the valuations here being roughly reflected
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2185.7s	2185.7	 The sas index is now down to about five and a half times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2190.3s	2190.3	 Revenue, I think next 12 months revenue for them for the median sas company and the median sas company is growing about 20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2197.7s	2197.7	 if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2198.8s	2198.8	 You're a high growth company which starts at 40 percent. You're trading at about eight times the next 12 months revenue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2204.3s	2204.3	 So doesn't zenis is sort of in there. I mean that is what they're trading for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2208.2s	2208.2	 And sas founders why go why would the founders the board?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2211.6s	2211.6	 I'll tell you want to go private is the question on people's minds. It's not it's not that they wanted to go private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2217.2s	2217.2	 I think that they wanted to stay public and they wanted to build a large business, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2221.8s	2221.8	 This is where the law of large numbers catches up with every company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2225.9s	2225.9	 That's why it's so rare to have an apple or a google or a microsoft or a facebook or netflix where you can grow for 20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2232.4s	2232.4	 Years at 25 plus percent because at some point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2235.9s	2235.9	 25 growth over last year just becomes too hard of a mount a big number
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2241.9s	2241.9	 And so what zendex suffered from is what most of these sas companies?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2246.8s	2246.8	 Not and i'm not trying to despair so i'm just calling it out. We'll have to go through which is the following
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2252.1s	2252.1	 The easiest kind of sas company to start and the one that folks, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2256.1s	2256.1	 Really talented investors like sacks will fund overwhelmingly over others
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2260.8s	2260.8	 Are what's called bottoms up sas, right things that sell to the low end of the market things that sell into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2268.0s	2268.0	 You know as individuals can buy them in a corporation as opposed to the cio. Yeah, the the unfortunate part of that growth curve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2275.2s	2275.2	 Is that it's pretty terminal within seven to ten years and after that you're forced to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2281.9s	2281.9	 To the mid market and that eventually you're forced to go enterprise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2285.3s	2285.3	 But when you go to the mid market and you're selling to 500 and you know, 1 000 2000 person companies and then eventually even enterprise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2292.0s	2292.0	 You're talking about massive investments of op-ex people engineers product managers salespeople
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2298.8s	2298.8	 And all of that stuff costs money and it's not clear that your product is any good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2303.2s	2303.2	 So in the zendex example, it's not to say their products were bad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2307.1s	2307.1	 But all of a sudden they were going up and selling a crm tool a salesforce automation tool
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2312.0s	2312.0	 And now you're going head to head against companies like salesforce who are going down market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2316.6s	2316.6	 And all of a sudden salesforce and microsoft and all these companies can play very aggressive pricing games with their products
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2322.9s	2322.9	 They can bundle all kinds of other things in for free. They can give you discounts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2327.6s	2327.6	 And it's very hard to compete as a single individual company. So your growth starts to stall
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2332.0s	2332.0	 So I suspect what happened at zendesk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2334.4s	2334.4	 Is they said we can make it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2336.6s	2336.6	 And we believe in ourselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2338.4s	2338.4	 And they found that it was hard then instead of organically growing. That's when they turned down the 17 billion dollar offer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2345.2s	2345.2	 They tried to grow inorganically. They looked at survey monkey, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2348.8s	2348.8	 Which our friend zander runs and said we're going to try to buy that for 4.1 billion dollars and the market said, uh-uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2354.2s	2354.2	 No
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2355.4s	2355.4	 And then the market basically contracts and now they're like well if we go and now torch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2360.8s	2360.8	 Our ebita goals and tell the market we're going to go and spend all that billion dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2365.5s	2365.5	 We have to try to go up against salesforce and microsoft with a product that we don't know is going to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2370.4s	2370.4	 Our stock's going to be at a dollar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2372.8s	2372.8	 and so I think that that's sort of the the parade of terribles that happen for them, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2377.2s	2377.2	 it's a little bit of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2378.6s	2378.6	 Warning sign for how difficult it is to get big like what salesforce pulled off right and what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2384.0s	2384.0	 Workday is starting to pull off what service now has pulled off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2388.5s	2388.5	 I mean you can't underestimate the quality of i mean google apple facebook. I'm saying i'm saying specifically enterprise sass. Yes, those companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2397.5s	2397.5	 Service now probably being the last one that's really did it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2401.1s	2401.1	 Incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2402.4s	2402.4	 So difficult palo alto networks is probably the next closest one now salesforce initial acquisitions. Let's be clear, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2408.5s	2408.5	 Salesforce doesn't matter how you get there organically inorganically doesn't matter. The point is it's very hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2413.3s	2413.3	 Our most ceos fail nobody is this going but okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2417.2s	2417.2	 So my original question is is this the bouncing along the bottom moment? No, because we have peloton. We have buzzfeed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2423.1s	2423.1	 We have so many of these companies. This is a warning sign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2426.5s	2426.5	 Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2428.2s	2428.2	 There's why yet the bottom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2430.4s	2430.4	 Well, this is a warning sign that says you cannot go into a massive investment cycle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2437.0s	2437.0	 For all companies unless you can prove that you can sustain margins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2442.1s	2442.1	 Sustain growth and minimize optics, but isn't this a very sophisticated buyer?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2447.9s	2447.9	 Taking it private. They must have a thesis of how they're going to get their money back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2453.3s	2453.3	 Right. So that's my point is sax you think that this is like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2457.6s	2457.6	 If if the company's already public and somebody thinks hey, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2461.6s	2461.6	 If I take this private I can do better than if it's public and i'll reintroduce it to the public markets to get liquidity later
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2467.3s	2467.3	 Isn't that what's going to happen here in all likelihood?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2468.9s	2468.9	 You're making that statement in the absence of understanding how these things are financed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2472.0s	2472.0	 Well, it's got a billion five and it's and it's break even almost so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2475.9s	2475.9	 Okay, what about the what about the the billions of dollars of debt?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2478.7s	2478.7	 They're going to take out and slab off this company, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2481.4s	2481.4	 What about the number of people they may you're talking about post going private at the end of the day?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2485.2s	2485.2	 The private equity firms are not trying to make you know, this 10 billion dollars go to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2491.0s	2491.0	 25 they're trying to make the 2 billion of equity they put in go to three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2494.8s	2494.8	 And there's a lot of ways that two can go to three before 10 goes to 25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2500.7s	2500.7	 So they want a modest return
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2502.7s	2502.7	 It's not a modest return. It's 50 return. It's a lot. It's making a billion dollars. It's hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2508.3s	2508.3	 Yeah, but but compared to the management team and the board's view of being a public company and growing 20 percent a year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2514.6s	2514.6	 Or it's actually in their case 30 would that be a better opportunity for those shareholders?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2518.6s	2518.6	 That's what doesn't add up here sax. What do you think if I had to guess?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2521.5s	2521.5	 I mean, I haven't talked to mickle about why they're doing it. I think that they're operating at a new stage of the business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2526.8s	2526.8	 I don't think it's as fun to be growing a company at call it 20 to 30 percent a year and now all of a sudden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2532.8s	2532.8	 You have to generate cash flow and you're being valued on that. I mean they're past
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2537.6s	2537.6	 Burnout insurance thesis. I don't know. I mean, it's it seems a potential thesis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2541.4s	2541.4	 I think that's basically why people sell good businesses. Like I actually don't think there's a problem in their business. I think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2547.8s	2547.8	 Growing 30 percent a year with 1.3 billion in revenue plenty of cash in the bank. I think they have a good product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2554.0s	2554.0	 I don't think there's anything wrong with the business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2556.6s	2556.6	 Yeah, I think that that I do think founders get burned out and this is an exit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2561.2s	2561.2	 And I do think that the phase of their business they're in right now is not going to be as fun
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2565.3s	2565.3	 As the high growth phase look when you're growing 100 200 percent a year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2569.3s	2569.3	 And investors are willing to fund that growth and they don't really care if you're profitable. That is just more fun
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2574.8s	2574.8	 Than growing a business 20 to 30 percent a year and investors are breathing down your neck saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2581.0s	2581.0	 When are you going to deliver cash flow and what the private equity guys do is they're going to go in there and they're going to restructure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2586.5s	2586.5	 the business to deliver cash flow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2590.5s	2590.5	 Now I think ultimately these types of businesses they're great these software businesses are great businesses to own because they're high gross margin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2597.7s	2597.7	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2598.5s	2598.5	 You know, they've got a subscription base that just keeps growing organically if they've got positive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2603.8s	2603.8	 Net dollar retention. So you've got a let's call it a 1.3 billion dollar subscription base that will grow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2610.2s	2610.2	 To two billion over the next whatever half dozen years and quite frankly, I bet you the private equity guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2615.6s	2615.6	 You're going to take out half the cost structure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2617.7s	2617.7	 This is no reason this thing could be generating 500 million a year in free cash flow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2622.0s	2622.0	 But the management team would be unwilling to do that because it's a different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2626.1s	2626.1	 It kind of sucks to do that every day to come in and fire half the team that you hired
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2630.4s	2630.4	 And take that hard medicine it just is a bummer for that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2634.6s	2634.6	 Personality type I think it is a different kind of management challenge and yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2639.3s	2639.3	 I don't think it's that fun. And but look the thesis behind software companies the justification
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2645.0s	2645.0	 For them burning money was look we're gonna we're gonna spend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2649.2s	2649.2	 Every dollar in revenue that we make and then some because we're building a subscription revenue base
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2654.8s	2654.8	 That again has positive net dollar retention. So one day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2659.0s	2659.0	 Okay, one day we won't have to keep investing so much in sales and marketing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2663.3s	2663.3	 We won't have to keep investing so much in r&d. We'll still keep investing to some degree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2668.4s	2668.4	 We'll make the product better, but it's going to be a little bit more maintenance mode. We will get to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2672.6s	2672.6	 maturity and then you can lay off a third of the staff and all of a sudden and then and then all of a sudden the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2676.8s	2676.8	 Company is going to be super profitable. And the fact of the matter is is that day never came because the markets never demanded it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2683.6s	2683.6	 Now that day is here. No, no, no, hold on. It never came because the markets kept demanding more growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2688.6s	2688.6	 If you look at their long-term operating margins, you know when they first when they first came out public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2693.6s	2693.6	 It's it like had like a negative 30 percent margin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2696.8s	2696.8	 Two years later. They had a negative 50 percent margin and over the last seven years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2701.5s	2701.5	 So that was 2015 up to now they've crawled their way back to negative 13 percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2707.7s	2707.7	 So at some point I think investors said oh my gosh, this company has never made money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2712.1s	2712.1	 It needs to keep investing more in order to grow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2715.2s	2715.2	 And I think david to your point maybe the decision that he didn't want to make was to flip it to a cash cow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2721.9s	2721.9	 I don't think that's true. I looked at um, these guys have been generating cash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2726.9s	2726.9	 Their reported gap earnings are negative because of the stock-based comp expense meaning that they're issuing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2731.8s	2731.8	 Well, there's a big topic to discuss here and I think that's actually worth highlighting because this is an important one because people have been talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2737.3s	2737.3	 About this considerably lately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2739.5s	2739.5	 So this company's been making money every quarter. They generate cash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2743.5s	2743.5	 But in the last quarter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2745.6s	2745.6	 They issued 60 million dollars in stock to employees to compensate them for the work that they do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2751.1s	2751.1	 So that's 250 million roughly of dollars per year of stock-based comp which is two and a half percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2758.7s	2758.7	 Of the total shares outstanding in the company are issued as employee comp every year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2764.8s	2764.8	 That number results in a dilutive effect to shareholders over time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2768.9s	2768.9	 Even though the business is generating cash your relative ownership as a shareholder in a business that's generating cash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2774.8s	2774.8	 Is going down by two and a half percent every year because of all the new shares that are being issued
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2779.6s	2779.6	 To compensate employees for the work that they're doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2782.5s	2782.5	 And I think that's part of the issue that a lot of folks kind of have taken for granted. This was well rooted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2787.7s	2787.7	 In um, I would say probably google who became very generous very early on with issuing rs us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2793.2s	2793.2	 And stock in their publicly traded securities to employees as part of their compensation package
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2798.5s	2798.5	 But google has a 30 40 percent ebitda margin in terms of incremental contribution of new new revenue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2804.8s	2804.8	 And um, they can afford to take a point or two of dilution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2810.0s	2810.0	 Google by the way is actually not dilutive. They they buy back shares with their extra cash. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2814.8s	2814.8	 As a shareholder you actually benefit from this considerable cash generation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2818.8s	2818.8	 But a lot of software businesses and tech companies in general
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2822.6s	2822.6	 Have had to rely on issuing shares to compensate employees for the work that they do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2826.4s	2826.4	 So even though the core fundamental of the business is generating cash and cash is going up every year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2831.6s	2831.6	 The business doesn't know how to get out of this cycle of how do you pay these engineers?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2835.7s	2835.7	 $400,000 a year without diluting shareholders by issuing all these new shares every year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2840.4s	2840.4	 And you'd have to do that more likely as a private company to figure out how to consolidate earnings how to trim headcount
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2846.8s	2846.8	 Isn't that to get the thing to generate the cash it needs to generate the free break?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2849.9s	2849.9	 Isn't that a real like you're pretending like it's some fake costs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2853.4s	2853.4	 Yeah, it's not it's it's a real cost it's a cost to shareholders for sure, but why but why why the asterisks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2859.2s	2859.2	 Well, no, there's a specific reason because the business itself operating out of cash. It's not burning cash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2864.5s	2864.5	 The business is growing its cash balance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2866.7s	2866.7	 But in order to compensate employees for that cash balance, they're diluting you the shareholder, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2872.4s	2872.4	 Look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2873.2s	2873.2	 When you own a share of a company, okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2875.4s	2875.4	 Let's say the way is another way of saying that the company is effectively issuing two and a half percent new stock every year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2880.8s	2880.8	 To fund its operations. I mean that's another way to think about it. Look i'll give you the warren buffett school
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2885.5s	2885.5	 You can tell me that it's stupid but it kind of makes sense, which is you take the number of shares you own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2890.3s	2890.3	 You divide it by the total the number of shares outstanding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2893.4s	2893.4	 You look at the total profits and you say my look through earnings equals that percentage times the total profits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2899.9s	2899.9	 Yeah, and your percentage is going down every year with stock-based comp
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2903.2s	2903.2	 That's the problem. And so the question is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2905.8s	2905.8	 It's also going down because you're buying real estate. You're hiring people you're paying them more like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2909.8s	2909.8	 It's going down for a whole host of reasons that asterisk is an irrelevant asterisk in my opinion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2913.9s	2913.9	 Like the end of the day you spend money to grow how you spend the money is not that important to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2918.4s	2918.4	 Let me say two quick things on the topic. One is um, yeah, I totally agree. It's an expense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2924.5s	2924.5	 on enterprise software and sax you're you're the the the master of the art, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2930.0s	2930.0	 You know as an observer, it seems to me that many of these companies once you have an enterprise account
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2935.2s	2935.2	 You benefit from being able to cross sell new products into that account and you can grow this net revenue retention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2940.6s	2940.6	 Number over time and ultimately generate cash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2943.2s	2943.2	 Many of the big enterprise software companies that we've talked about from sales force to work day and others have succeeded in doing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2949.6s	2949.6	 Autodesk is another good example and carl bass. I think's on the board of zendesk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2953.4s	2953.4	 They've done. Um, they've done this successfully by bulking up their product categories and they're they've done acquisitions or they've done build outs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2960.6s	2960.6	 and so over time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2962.2s	2962.2	 Your incremental cost to uh to to sell a new product and generate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2967.5s	2967.5	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2968.6s	2968.6	 Incremental gross profit goes down and the business performs better with scale
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2972.8s	2972.8	 This seems to be one of those businesses where ultimately they couldn't bulk up through acquisition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2977.2s	2977.2	 And they couldn't organically try products and they tried and so the challenge is they're kind of a I don't want to say one trick pony
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2984.0s	2984.0	 But the portfolio of things that a business like this can sell into and ultimately increment gross profit is very limited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2989.4s	2989.4	 And that business becomes challenging to operate as a public company because you really do have to show that momentum as a as a scaled enterprise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2995.3s	2995.3	 Software business that you're actually generating real cash over time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=2999.6s	2999.6	 The other thing I just want to say on stock based comp and sorry sex
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3002.4s	3002.4	 Let's come back in one sec, but chamath and and you guys I don't know if you realize this but the standard in silicon valley today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3009.2s	3009.2	 When a company goes public in an ipo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3012.0s	3012.0	 Is to have what's called an evergreen stock grant proposal. Um, and evergreen, um, basically means that every year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3018.6s	3018.6	 The company is authorized the board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3021.5s	3021.5	 Automatically authorizes the issuance of some percentage of new shares per year. This is typically in the range of four percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3029.0s	3029.0	 and iss and other you know kind of institutional shareholder advisory services actually vote against
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3035.6s	3035.6	 These shareholder proposals and push back against them, but most of the companies in silicon valley that go public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3041.9s	3041.9	 Automatically include evergreens as part of their you know, kind of ipo prospectus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3046.3s	3046.3	 I mean can we agree it's out of control like it's yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3048.4s	3048.4	 Which means that every year they can they can dilute shareholders by four percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3052.2s	3052.2	 And independent of how the business operated that year, which is effectively the same as doing a four percent secondary cash offering every year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3060.0s	3060.0	 Because it's this you're issuing those shares into the public market and instead of getting cash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3064.7s	3064.7	 You're paying your employees with them and so it avoids you having to use your own cash balance to pay your employees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3070.3s	3070.3	 So you're effectively raising money every year and you're allowed to raise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3073.9s	3073.9	 Up to four percent dilutive effect to shareholders to do that every year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3077.6s	3077.6	 And it's become a real topic and it seems to me that a lot of the big portfolio managers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3081.6s	3081.6	 Of big institutional funds are starting to pay really close attention to this quote-unquote standard in silicon valley
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3088.4s	3088.4	 That stock-based comp expense has become so high and evergreens have become kind of a standard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3093.2s	3093.2	 as almost like an ordinary course of business and it's become
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3096.4s	3096.4	 Um, you know a really contentious topic and I don't think it would be too surprising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3100.4s	3100.4	 Uh number one to see cash salaries go up and number two as a result of that to see salaries become rationalized in silicon valley
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3107.1s	3107.1	 Where engineers may start to get challenged on the standard 400k per year?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3111.1s	3111.1	 That everyone's become used to um, you know in terms of you know high tier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3115.7s	3115.7	 You know silicon valley with remote work. Maybe there is a a compromise that could be had but this compensation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3121.7s	3121.7	 You have to remember has been outrageous in some cases
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3125.0s	3125.0	 Especially for senior management and so it makes the core business look broken
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3129.7s	3129.7	 But what you actually have is maybe people who are on these boards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3133.3s	3133.3	 Are also in on this compensation and it's just bad hygiene and it's not related to the performance of the company, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3139.2s	3139.2	 I don't think I don't think the board people are quote in on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3141.2s	3141.2	 I think that's it's just it's you have to pay an engineer 400k a year to compete effectively in silicon valley today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3146.4s	3146.4	 Well, I was talking more about the management's the management stock comp the management stock comp is different than the engineers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3152.1s	3152.1	 You would agree free free like there have been some enormous stock grants board. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3156.1s	3156.1	 Yeah, certainly if you want to run the company as a high growth startup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3161.0s	3161.0	 Employing these high paid engineers and executives including stock compensation. That is a certain kind of way of running the business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3167.6s	3167.6	 But again, if you're trying to run the business for profitability, that's a different way of running the business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3171.6s	3171.6	 And just to add a layer to what happened here that zendesk was under intense pressure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3177.2s	3177.2	 From an activist investor called janna who was basically trying to replace the board of directors. They're running a proxy battle against them. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3185.5s	3185.5	 Jana has been pressuring them to replace the board to to make all these changes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3190.7s	3190.7	 That to take the 17 billion dollar offer I guess back in march. They didn't do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3195.6s	3195.6	 Now they did a lower offer at 10 billion. Why I think because the market has clarified we now it's it's clear that we're in this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3203.2s	3203.2	 Regime change what the market is valuing is free cash flow as opposed to profitless growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3210.1s	3210.1	 And my guess is again without having talked to mickle my guess is they probably just threw up their arm and said listen, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3216.0s	3216.0	 Like it's not going to be fun to run the company this way, but you also have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3220.8s	3220.8	 You have to ask the question. Why are these highly sophisticated private equity firms buying it for 10 billion?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3225.1s	3225.1	 I think they're going to make a lot of money and the way they're going to make a lot of money more than a billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3230.3s	3230.3	 They are going to slash the hell out of the cost structure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3233.2s	3233.2	 They're going to run it to be highly profitable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3235.4s	3235.4	 They'll probably bring the growth down from 30 percent a year to 20 percent or 15 percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3240.5s	3240.5	 But the benefit the offsetting benefit to reducing the growth a little bit will be they could probably generate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3246.0s	3246.0	 Three four five hundred million of free cash flow on that business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3249.2s	3249.2	 If it's doing 1.3 billion and they stop investing in rnd and they stop and they bring down the sales and marketing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3255.5s	3255.5	 That could be a that could be a cash cow. Like you said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3258.3s	3258.3	 So I think that's probably what's what's going on here. Um is the just like I just want you guys to know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3263.5s	3263.5	 Not to burst this bubble, but when people talk about free cash flow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3267.2s	3267.2	 they touted a lot tech companies touted a lot because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3270.9s	3270.9	 You're allowed to add back in stock-based comp as if it didn't exist. The problem is that stock-based comp is non-cash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3279.2s	3279.2	 So when when your only source so if you see a company that has negative ebit done negative everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3285.4s	3285.4	 All of a sudden are like quote-unquote free cash flow positive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3288.8s	3288.8	 It's because they were able to add back in stock-based comp, but that money is not real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3293.3s	3293.3	 So when the only source of free cash is stock-based comp that free cash flow doesn't reflect the company's true profitability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3300.1s	3300.1	 This is what I mean by people play these shell games with these numbers to allow, you know, oh let's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3306.4s	3306.4	 You know value something based on ebit actually no because you know, our stock-based comp is off the charts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3311.0s	3311.0	 Let's actually go to something else, you know, we'll do a non-gap ebit to measure, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3315.7s	3315.7	 You know adjusted ebit uh, and then oh actually wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3318.7s	3318.7	 Sorry, look at free cash flow because you can add back in this gargantuan amount of stock-based comp
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3323.8s	3323.8	 I mean, it's crazy. I'll just the quote from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3327.4s	3327.4	 We work the the the quote from warren buffett summarizes the best if compensation isn't an expense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3334.5s	3334.5	 What is it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3336.5s	3336.5	 And if real and recurring expenses don't belong in the calculation of earnings where in the world do they belong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3343.4s	3343.4	 I think what we're seeing right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3345.2s	3345.2	 My point is is not that comp isn't an expense it is but rather that it's an expense that you can control by reducing the amount
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3352.5s	3352.5	 Of staff. No, I guess is I think these private equity guys are gonna basically whack the cost structure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3357.4s	3357.4	 This business i'm just saying you can distort free cash flow as well because you can head back in stock-based comp
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3361.8s	3361.8	 It's a joke. It's a little bit of a shell game going on. It's like the dirty secrets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3365.8s	3365.8	 Let me ask you a like an important investing accounting question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3371.0s	3371.0	 Let's say that a business like um zendesk is generating 100 million dollars of free cash a year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3377.3s	3377.3	 No, no, what does that mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3378.7s	3378.7	 Well, hold on so every year their cash balance goes up by 100 million dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3383.1s	3383.1	 They have a business it generates 100 million dollars of incremental cash every year the cash balance goes up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3388.0s	3388.0	 So you as a shareholder own shares in a company that is creating 100 million dollars of cap of incremental capital per year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3394.8s	3394.8	 However, your shares that you own are going down because they're getting diluted every year by roughly two and a half three percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3403.0s	3403.0	 And that's it's two and a half percent is then that's the actual number
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3406.2s	3406.2	 So every year you're getting diluted by two and a half percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3409.0s	3409.0	 Would you rather have a business that you are getting diluted by two and a half percent?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3413.3s	3413.3	 But it's incrementing its overall balance by 100 million dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3416.6s	3416.6	 Or would you rather own shares in a company that's burning cash each year?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3420.1s	3420.1	 And I think that's where this ended up from a market perspective getting rationalized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3424.6s	3424.6	 Is shareholders said I want to have the safety and security of cash generation and i'm willing to take on the dilution for it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3430.6s	3430.6	 And that's how this became, you know as standard as it is when I think about funding a new startup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3436.6s	3436.6	 And I look at the competitive landscape when I see that the competitors have all been acquired by private equity companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3443.7s	3443.7	 I generally think okay. There's room for innovation here because I know that the first thing the pe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3449.5s	3449.5	 Firms are going to do when they acquire a company is like zero out rnd or just put the product on maintenance mode
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3456.4s	3456.4	 There's no innovation that happens. Yep with the product once the p firms buy the buy it, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3461.2s	3461.2	 So the reality is I think so those are good targets for startups to do acquisitions, right sacs. I mean they'll find yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3467.7s	3467.7	 They'll do roll-ups, right? Because it's they will do financial innovation. They will innovate the the structure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3474.6s	3474.6	 All the wasteful spending and all the nonsense and lunches, yeah exactly chum on say once like cut out all the kind bars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3481.5s	3481.5	 Yeah, the kind bars are exposed brick walls like all this nonsense. Yeah, so who do you think's a vegas trip?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3487.4s	3487.4	 Yeah, the stock based compensation is gonna go away because they're gonna get rid of all the high price engineers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3491.3s	3491.3	 They're gonna get rid of the a lot of the high price executives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3494.3s	3494.3	 They're gonna probably they're gonna have to keep customer support. They're gonna increase cash salaries, probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3500.3s	3500.3	 They'll bonus people they'll just do bonuses for hitting targets instead of giving people as much equity in the business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3506.6s	3506.6	 And they'll run it like a you know, private equity type type play. Why don't you do this sex?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3512.2s	3512.2	 It's not fun. It's not interesting to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3515.1s	3515.1	 Yeah, I mean we're gonna see it's not a big product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3518.1s	3518.1	 I think david the other reason why it wouldn't be fun is like it's a it's a level of financial engineering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3522.1s	3522.1	 Which is highly sophisticated. I think for some people it is fun. I think for us it's less fun because you're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3527.1s	3527.1	 Necessarily creating a company per se not innovating. You're not being a product person here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3531.0s	3531.0	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3531.3s	3531.3	 But I would say that it is a highly sophisticated and the folks that do it at these places that these private equity firms are incredibly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3537.1s	3537.1	 They're very good at it savvy at how they do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3540.0s	3540.0	 And it's it's all the twists and turns of how you you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3542.6s	3542.6	 Lever this up and use debt and blah and use a margin loan and pre-fund the I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3548.2s	3548.2	 It's not the stuff that necessarily we want to be thinking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3552.3s	3552.3	 But that's what you'd have to do as well. I totally agree with that. Look i'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3556.1s	3556.1	 I'm happy they exist in the ecosystem because we need firms. We need more exits, right and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3562.4s	3562.4	 we know that right now in washington the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3566.5s	3566.5	 The regulatory regime is very difficult. It's very hard to get deals through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3571.0s	3571.0	 So at least you have private equity firms that are providing some exits and we need the ecosystem needs and those exits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3576.8s	3576.8	 You're saying sacks don't trigger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3579.1s	3579.1	 Like comp competitive concerns with lena con and her group, right? Like yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3583.1s	3583.1	 She's like some private equity firm took this private. Okay, sales force didn't buy it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3586.3s	3586.3	 So we don't need to get through regulators
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3588.1s	3588.1	 You're going to see a lot of we need exits in order to justify the risk capital that goes in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3594.0s	3594.0	 At the earliest stages, which in most cases is going to be a zero
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3597.6s	3597.6	 And just to give you some other numbers out there manscaped, which is the company sells razors for guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3602.9s	3602.9	 They had 315 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3605.4s	3605.4	 In net loss in 2021 with 310 million in stock-based comp by the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3609.6s	3609.6	 That number can also be distorted just to be clear if you give a one-time big grant to an executive like a ceo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3616.7s	3616.7	 The way that the accounting works on stock-based comp. It's not the kind of thing you can have a very simple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3622.0s	3622.0	 Kind of descriptor on but you can have these very significant short-term costs associated with a big grant that could vest over a long period of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3629.3s	3629.3	 Sure, that has very high strike prices. I mean when elon got that massive grant at tesla the stock-based comp expense was significant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3638.1s	3638.1	 But you know what the interesting way into it it was that was there were 20 targets or something crazy like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3643.1s	3643.1	 And all of them were based or a lot of them were based on the stock price and the delivery of cars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3647.5s	3647.5	 So that's one of the things that I think is broken. Yeah. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3650.4s	3650.4	 So this is one of the things that's broken in silicon valley is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3653.5s	3653.5	 The the comp in the stock-based comp is not tied to performance. It's like just giving people guaranteed salaries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3659.1s	3659.1	 In fact, I was going to say jason I could be wrong like there is more sophistication to be clear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3663.8s	3663.8	 In executive comp in public technology companies, I think that should trickle down to the junior people, too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3668.7s	3668.7	 I think everybody should rise and fall with the company's performance. That's my personal feeling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3672.4s	3672.4	 I mean, this is the problem with entitlements, you know and people being entitled. I started to be like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3677.6s	3677.6	 Red pill tier but we should have like performance should be lauded and compensated for not just showing up and hanging out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3684.8s	3684.8	 There's going to be a bunch of companies in this position. So look for this as a trend peloton
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3689.3s	3689.3	 964 million last quarter in revenue lost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3692.7s	3692.7	 757 million in the quarter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3694.4s	3694.4	 They have a 3.1 billion dollar market cap. They've only got 870 million dollars worth of cash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3698.9s	3698.9	 I'm just looking at these numbers. Hopefully they're they're tight. Um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3702.4s	3702.4	 And they have a billion for an inventory that company is going to get taken out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3706.5s	3706.5	 Buzzfeed, I don't know why that even went public. They're down 84 percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3710.0s	3710.0	 They had 91 million a media company 91 million dollars in q1 revenue. They lost 45 million their market cap is down to 210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3718.4s	3718.4	 Million and they've only got 74 million in cash or so with some you know, maybe 100 millions in accounts receivable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3724.6s	3724.6	 So there's a bunch of companies right now that are public that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3728.5s	3728.5	 About to hit in a couple of quarters running out of cash going into a recession. Are we going to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3734.6s	3734.6	 Some big flameouts do you think and are you watching specific companies because the private equity folks must be salivating watching this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3741.5s	3741.5	 Well, I mean look how you asked what the takeaway was around this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3745.0s	3745.0	 And I think the takeaway is there's been a regime change in the public markets the way that investors look at these companies is changing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3751.2s	3751.2	 It's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3752.3s	3752.3	 About growth at all costs anymore. They're not just looking at revenues. It's also about margins and cash flow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3758.1s	3758.1	 And you know we talked about in the last pod how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3761.5s	3761.5	 I think a lot of founders understand intellectually that we're headed for a downturn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3767.0s	3767.0	 If not a recession, but they weren't taking the medicine of basically reducing their burn. Well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3772.5s	3772.5	 This is an indication of what investors are valuing if the only way for zendesk to create value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3778.9s	3778.9	 As a public company is to sell to a private equity firm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3782.1s	3782.1	 Who's going to cut half the staff is going to cut off or some huge number of staff to run it for free cash flow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3787.2s	3787.2	 That's just an indication of the regime change. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3790.4s	3790.4	 You know, we need founders to start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3793.1s	3793.1	 Internalizing this information so they can run their businesses more efficiently, you know what investors want right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3798.9s	3798.9	 They still want growth, but they want it with low burn high burn operations are going to get punished
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3804.6s	3804.6	 I've transitioned most of my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3807.0s	3807.0	 Public markets time to focus on debt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3811.0s	3811.0	 And i've been looking at these companies because yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3813.0s	3813.0	 Because there's a lot of these really interesting tech companies with a lot of because what david said I think is a hundred
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3818.8s	3818.8	 Thousand percent right what sax just said there is a massive massive regime change here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3824.8s	3824.8	 And yeah, and when shocking you if you don't take the medicine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3828.0s	3828.0	 Yeah, and and what what's funny is like so many of these companies have been left for dead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3832.8s	3832.8	 But what is really juicy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3836.1s	3836.1	 Is the few companies that you think will survive?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3839.2s	3839.2	 And specifically making sure you're protected in the capital structure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3842.5s	3842.5	 Which means to own the debt because the debt is always senior to the equity and there's some really really interesting companies out there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3850.4s	3850.4	 That are in that situation and it's just like it's a much better risk reward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3855.1s	3855.1	 In a moment where again, you know, we talked about this, but why would you give up your liquidity today? I don't know the answer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3862.2s	3862.2	 Why why let's go around the board? Yeah, you use this term jason before like skipping along the bottom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3867.6s	3867.6	 I just think it's like psychological wishful thinking as opposed to sort of like a rational summation of the actual jaron powell just said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3875.0s	3875.0	 I will tank the economy in order to beat inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3878.5s	3878.5	 He just said it in the wall street journal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3880.8s	3880.8	 But people believe inflation might be turning over do you buy that or not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3884.4s	3884.4	 No, as i've said, I think you're going to see eight and nine percent inflation prints for at least the next three or four months minimum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3891.6s	3891.6	 I think that things could get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3895.1s	3895.1	 Marginally better after that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3897.2s	3897.2	 But I think the thing we don't know and again it just touches and I don't care what the fucking audience thinks touches russia and ukraine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3904.1s	3904.1	 So sorry to bring up politics, but no, these things are inexorably intertwined
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3909.2s	3909.2	 And if people want to go and venture and gamble in the stock market, you might as well understand this because I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3915.1s	3915.1	 You know many of the scenarios will trade because of what's going to happen with putin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3920.4s	3920.4	 Let me ask the question here. How many quarters will this recession be if we had to pick a range pick a two quarter range?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3927.8s	3927.8	 I'm thinking three to five. What do you think? I have no idea. Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3931.9s	3931.9	 Freberg you gotta
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3933.5s	3933.5	 This is the second how many quarters?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3936.6s	3936.6	 Plus or minus two let's say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3938.6s	3938.6	 Uh, is this recession going to be so five plus or minus two four plus or minus two plus or minus one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3943.7s	3943.7	 What are you thinking will be the bottom out point? I don't like the term i've told you guys. I don't like the term
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3949.8s	3949.8	 Quote recession as if it's some absolute negative thing. I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3953.3s	3953.3	 negative gdp growth coming off of inflated gdp doesn't feel to me as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3958.0s	3958.0	 Uh systemically challenging to the economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3962.4s	3962.4	 As uh, you know, but some other circumstance where for example, there was a global financial crisis or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3969.7s	3969.7	 9 11 or some other kind of factor that that drove things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3974.0s	3974.0	 Uh that that really affected the core economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3977.9s	3977.9	 We're certainly we hadn't we had something that that affected the core economy in covet then we had massive stimulus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3983.9s	3983.9	 So I I don't I think there's this unfortunate general characterization of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3988.6s	3988.6	 quote unquote recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3990.5s	3990.5	 Being an absolute negative and I think that there's relative growth and if you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=3996.0s	3996.0	 If your relative growth is negative off of an inflated number
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4000.0s	4000.0	 But over a okay, let me give you let me let me just finish but over a historic two or three year period
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4005.3s	4005.3	 You're still growing the economy considerably because jobs, uh jobs are growing and production is growing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4011.6s	4011.6	 Uh, it's not as negative as it's being made out to be so I i'm not gonna okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4015.5s	4015.5	 I get you get into let me let me ask you this way then how many more quarters will we have of?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4021.0s	4021.0	 Stocks and real estate and assets declining in value or being flat. That's a financial markets question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4027.6s	4027.6	 Which I think is a different one and one thing i've realized is that financial markets in the short term
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4033.5s	4033.5	 Uh, you know the old warren buffett quote or whomever it is that over the long term equities are a weighing machine in the short term
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4039.2s	4039.2	 They're a voting machine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4040.8s	4040.8	 As we've seen with crypto it was a voting machine that everyone voted on the the hot thing du jour
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4046.8s	4046.8	 And now everyone's voting against it. So I I don't know they're weighing it now. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4051.2s	4051.2	 Well, yeah, I mean at some point there's nothing there. You hold a cryptocurrency long enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4055.2s	4055.2	 You'll find out how much fundamental productive value it's creating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4058.9s	4058.9	 And the same is true for owning businesses or other real assets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4062.2s	4062.2	 You'll find out over the long run how much productive value they're creating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4065.5s	4065.5	 So, so you don't want to answer the question of when we hit a floor, okay sacks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4068.6s	4068.6	 When do you think we hit are we are we hitting a floor now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4071.5s	4071.5	 We have a lot more to go down. I'll tell you one point of view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4073.6s	4073.6	 I I am looking at buying high quality share businesses buying shares of high quality businesses right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4079.4s	4079.4	 I think that there are things that are that are cheaply priced and if I own them for a long enough period of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4083.6s	4083.6	 The underlying productive value of that business will return my capital to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4087.7s	4087.7	 And so you have one that you might want to mention here that you're looking at I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4092.7s	4092.7	 Because you don't want to get the cards at the summit with our friend sunny he's his trades are up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4097.6s	4097.6	 But like I told him these are longer term trades sacks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4100.2s	4100.2	 What do you think in terms of and then we'll go to some of the political stuff that affects markets after this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4104.8s	4104.8	 Well, I mean, I think it's all related
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4106.4s	4106.4	 So there's three things going on here right now economically or three underlying causes one is rate expectations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4113.7s	4113.7	 Have changed massively interest rates have gone up and rate expectations are going up even more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4119.9s	4119.9	 Fueled by inflation and until we see where we're at on inflation whether that gets controlled that issue is not going away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4126.8s	4126.8	 The second big issue is economic slowdown the recession. So the first one is wall street
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4131.3s	4131.3	 This is main street and these two things are related because companies are slamming on the brakes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4136.0s	4136.0	 because they're seeing that the capital availability is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4140.1s	4140.1	 Greatly getting reduced by this rerating this regime change in markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4144.9s	4144.9	 So we're seeing an economic slowdown that threatens to turn into a recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4149.2s	4149.2	 And consumer confidence is part of that right when your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4152.1s	4152.1	 Wages don't buy you as much because food and gas prices are through the roof that reduces consumer confidence and that also plays into that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4158.8s	4158.8	 So that's the second big issue and I don't think we're going to know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4161.6s	4161.6	 about recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4163.2s	4163.2	 It's going to take you know, potentially through the rest of the year before we figure out what's happening there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4168.4s	4168.4	 And then the third part of this is the overhang of this war in europe the ukraine war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4173.2s	4173.2	 Which is now threatening to become a forever war. There was a pretty stunning article
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4178.6s	4178.6	 In the washington post this week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4180.9s	4180.9	 In which the administration officials were quoted as saying that they would effectively prefer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4187.9s	4187.9	 Or countenance was their word a global recession and famine over letting russia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4193.6s	4193.6	 Keep the donbass region. So they are committed now to basically prying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4198.8s	4198.8	 Russia out of the donbass even if it means global recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4202.8s	4202.8	 Not to mention they say specifically the donbass or specifically standing up to putin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4207.3s	4207.3	 Well, that's kind of minimizing what we're talking about is is the donbass region what's happened is look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4212.9s	4212.9	 The russians lost the first few weeks of the war in which they tried to strike
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4217.6s	4217.6	 They they basically went for a knockout blow to take over keev topple zolinski. I think we accomplished something in preventing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4225.4s	4225.4	 But since then they have achieved their objective of taking over this eastern portion of the country this donbass region
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4232.4s	4232.4	 In which this is where most of the ethnic russians live
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4235.7s	4235.7	 and these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4237.0s	4237.0	 ukrainian separatists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4238.5s	4238.5	 Who are ethnically russian they've been fighting alongside the russian troops and the russians have basically won that part of the war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4245.9s	4245.9	 And so the question is what do we do now and what you had is you had administration officials
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4250.2s	4250.2	 Saying that they would not accept the status quo that they are willing to fight on for years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4254.9s	4254.9	 You know the same geniuses who gave us the forever wars of the middle east are now giving us a forever war in eastern europe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4261.8s	4261.8	 And they are saying that they are willing to basically continue this fight even if it means global recession now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4267.8s	4267.8	 I don't think the american people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4269.9s	4269.9	 ever voted for this but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4272.0s	4272.0	 This is what the administration is pursuing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4274.3s	4274.3	 And you know, you got to remember that there's always the risk that this war spins out of control that we get a nuclear escalation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4280.3s	4280.3	 So I think that this is a huge overhang on markets. It's a third big problem that we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4285.6s	4285.6	 So I don't see how we get out of this bear market until you get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4290.0s	4290.0	 Clarity and resolution of inflation and rates number one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4294.4s	4294.4	 Slow down the recession number two and basically this war in europe number three and it's reflexive because uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4301.0s	4301.0	 these next three months as I as I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4303.3s	4303.3	 kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4304.8s	4304.8	 Indicated last week. I think we're going to see inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4307.9s	4307.9	 Uh prints that are really high in part because things like rents which haven't you know, which are on a lag
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4313.4s	4313.4	 We'll get folded back in so we're going to be printing eight and nine percents and then guess what jason? It's the fall
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4319.4s	4319.4	 It starts to get colder. You know, uh russia's depriving europe of nat gas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4324.8s	4324.8	 Where's the oil going to come from?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4326.6s	4326.6	 OPEC is basically still stiff farming the united states with respect to expanded production capacity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4332.1s	4332.1	 Why because they didn't like the way that we were strong arming them and a whole bunch of other topics is in it, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4337.2s	4337.2	 And so where do we stand you could have 180?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4340.4s	4340.4	 A barrel oil by november december when it's cold not just here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4343.8s	4343.8	 But in continental europe now all of a sudden inflation gets kicks right back up again. It could be seven eight nine percent again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4351.5s	4351.5	 I so I just think all of these things are now so inexorably intertwined. I think david's right we need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4357.1s	4357.1	 put this war to bed and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4360.7s	4360.7	 The unfortunate consequence is that right now if we want to fight a proxy war there is no elegant off ramp
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4370.3s	4370.3	 that I see so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4372.6s	4372.6	 The prediction markets just so people know are are predicting point eight point nine percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4378.0s	4378.0	 Additional inflation in june over and I think that's over last month and last month was eight point six
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4383.5s	4383.5	 So we're going to be at nine and a half jason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4385.1s	4385.1	 Could you imagine what the markets do if we print a double-digit inflation print ten and a half percent?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4390.2s	4390.2	 10.1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4391.5s	4391.5	 Just the psychology of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4393.5s	4393.5	 Uh, well consumer psychology is really low right now. No not consumer psychology. I'm thinking market psychology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4399.2s	4399.2	 No market too. Yeah, so we put those two things together and then if this war is never ending and the famine that um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4405.2s	4405.2	 And the impact on 40 million people or something like that that freberg predicted is actually going to happen in the next six months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4411.9s	4411.9	 Uh, this is going to feel quite chaotic to people around the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4414.9s	4414.9	 So we we do need to put this work to bed for sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4418.3s	4418.3	 There's no deal on the table right now, but the deal that we've talked about on previous shows there was always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4424.0s	4424.0	 the broad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4425.1s	4425.1	 Construct here even before the war began was there were three pieces to it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4429.5s	4429.5	 number one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4430.9s	4430.9	 was that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4432.8s	4432.8	 that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4433.6s	4433.6	 Ukraine had to remain a neutral state as opposed to being brought into nato and having american troops weapons and bases
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4440.5s	4440.5	 On russia's border that was always a red line to them and in exchange for neutrality ukraine would get security guarantees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4447.5s	4447.5	 Piece number two was that in the eastern region where you had these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4450.8s	4450.8	 Russians these russian speakers that their rights would be respected and that they would have some autonomy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4456.4s	4456.4	 And again that was something that ukraine agreed to under the minsk accords, but it was never properly implemented
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4461.6s	4461.6	 And the third piece was that russia got to keep korea which again was a fait accompli that happened in 2014
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4468.7s	4468.7	 Smart observers of this conflict have been outlining that three point plan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4473.5s	4473.5	 for over a year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4475.2s	4475.2	 And that is what we're going to end up with the only difference is that it's going to be implemented by force
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4481.5s	4481.5	 And ukraine will be destroying the process that is basically where we're at right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4486.3s	4486.3	 russia has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4488.0s	4488.0	 They've taken over the donbass. They've taken over this eastern 20 of the country. They have korea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4493.0s	4493.0	 And ukraine basically the the the rest of it will not be part of nato
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4497.7s	4497.7	 That is basically what the russians have done is implement by force
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4501.8s	4501.8	 a plan that frankly we could have agreed to through negotiation a year ago and avoided all this death and destruction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4509.1s	4509.1	 My my calculus jason is maybe I mean we don't know putin's intent and that's that's the wild card here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4514.4s	4514.4	 He is a bit of a madman. I mean, he's pretty much of a wild card here. He's a dictator who invaded another country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4520.2s	4520.2	 Yeah, my my calculus is slightly different. I think I see two things in order to get us back to a state of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4526.2s	4526.2	 relatively predictable growth and price stability number one is we need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4531.0s	4531.0	 Reset supply and demand by taking 30 trillion dollars out of global markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4537.0s	4537.0	 And then the second is we need an off ramp to this ukraine russia war so that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4541.1s	4541.1	 There is predictable energy and food supply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4544.3s	4544.3	 To the world so that folks can just get back to what they do best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4548.1s	4548.1	 And if those two things can happen, then the markets will have found the bottom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4553.8s	4553.8	 but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4554.8s	4554.8	 Until those two things happen in my opinion, and by the way, the first thing doesn't actually have to happen entirely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4560.1s	4560.1	 You just need to see a path for it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4562.0s	4562.0	 And you know, we're the only one that's doing quantitative tightening right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4565.4s	4565.4	 The ecb hasn't even started taking all this crazy money out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4570.0s	4570.0	 You know, I don't know when the bank of england is going to do it. When is you know, the bank of japan going to do it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4574.3s	4574.3	 So this has to be a global coordinated effort before we find the bottom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4579.0s	4579.0	 And this war has to stop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4581.0s	4581.0	 Well jace can I go back to this? Uh unpredictable madman narrative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4585.3s	4585.3	 Jason yeah, look if we're the dictator. Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4589.1s	4589.1	 If what you're trying to say here is that putin bears moral culpability and moral responsibility the blood is on his hands for this war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4595.7s	4595.7	 I agree with you on that. Okay. However, this idea how could you not I mean he he's the person who invaded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4600.8s	4600.8	 Right but but just logic there right but the idea that this war was unpredictable or could not have been predicted is simply false because many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4609.3s	4609.3	 Experts did predict it and they did tell us exactly what's going to happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4613.2s	4613.2	 And the reason they knew was going to happen is because russia's been saying since at least 2008
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4617.9s	4617.9	 Uh when there was this bucarest summit and nato declared its intent to bring ukraine into nato
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4623.1s	4623.1	 The russia's been saying that is a red line
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4625.6s	4625.6	 And russia experts biden's own cia director a guy named bill burns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4629.8s	4629.8	 He was then our uh emissary to russia and he wrote a memo to then secretary of state khanaliza rice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4636.1s	4636.1	 And what he said is that the idea of bringing expanding nato to ukraine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4641.4s	4641.4	 Was a red line for the entire russian elite not just putin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4645.5s	4645.5	 So uh, and if you go back and look about what other russian leaders said about nato expansion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4651.6s	4651.6	 Gorbachev said it was a humiliation to russia yeltsin was against it. They've all been against it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4656.6s	4656.6	 And so bill burns warned in 2008 this was a red line and the russia has been saying this since 2008
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4662.8s	4662.8	 And they were saying it all of last year if you go look at contemporaneous headlines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4668.0s	4668.0	 Describing the tensions between the u.s. And russia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4672.5s	4672.5	 This is the headlines of articles that can provide to nick we can put on the screen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4676.0s	4676.0	 They were saying this was an absolute red line for them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4678.3s	4678.3	 So the idea that this conflict was unpredictable because punz a madman listen, you can call him a dictator
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4683.5s	4683.5	 Exactly also we could also predict highly predictable. Yeah, okay, and you know, it's also highly predictable is that china considers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4690.9s	4690.9	 You know taiwan or renegade, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4694.4s	4694.4	 province like yes dictators
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4697.1s	4697.1	 You know, uh will tell us what they're going to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4699.0s	4699.0	 The question is does the free world want to stand up to dictators? And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4703.0s	4703.0	 While you know, uh, it's messy to stand up to a dictator
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4707.0s	4707.0	 The west, you know kind of doesn't have a choice to stand up to dictators or else they will roll into other countries history has shown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4712.7s	4712.7	 That so as messy as this is and as terrible as it is for the economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4717.4s	4717.4	 I do think that we have to stand up to dictators. There are plenty of dictators where we work with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4722.0s	4722.0	 By they're not invading other countries. They're not invading other countries and that's the difference here sax you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4727.2s	4727.2	 We could have avoided we're giving Putin a bit of a pass here. He invaded the country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4731.0s	4731.0	 We must stand up to dictators who invade other countries. Well, look look where you're standing up. I don't mean just america. I mean the free world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4738.9s	4738.9	 Yeah, well look look where you've got us then with this policy you and the people we could have avoided
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4743.6s	4743.6	 Yeah, because you are basically spouting this this nonsense that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4748.6s	4748.6	 Look the question is stand up to dictators who invade other countries. I think you would agree. That's a good idea. Let him talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4754.7s	4754.7	 Let us discuss. Okay free bird. Okay. Listen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4758.1s	4758.1	 There's no question that russia has been the aggressor but the question is why do they do this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4762.3s	4762.3	 You don't really have a theory on that jason except that you believe that on february 24th
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4767.3s	4767.3	 Putin woke up and went nuts. That's basically your explanation. No, that's not what's happening in the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4773.0s	4773.0	 No, it's a debated. We know it's a debated region. We know that they've had this conflict for a long time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4777.5s	4777.5	 Okay, so we could have used it here on the pod many times every every president from bill clinton to obama
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4784.0s	4784.0	 Who has dealt with putin has written largely the same account of him in their memoirs, which is look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4790.0s	4790.0	 They know that he's a thug. They know that he's a dictator. However, they always said they always said he's very businesslike
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4796.0s	4796.0	 He's very direct. He told them what their issues were. Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4800.2s	4800.2	 Putin was very direct. He and biden had a summit in june of last year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4806.0s	4806.0	 The russian has been very direct your attempt to bring ukraine into nato is a red line for us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4811.6s	4811.6	 Why it's a violation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4813.4s	4813.4	 Of our security interests the idea of bringing a country into nato
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4817.7s	4817.7	 It has huge security externalities for them, by the way, we understand this in other contexts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4822.8s	4822.8	 We understood in the context of cuban missile crisis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4825.5s	4825.5	 We didn't say that cuba had the right to join any military alliance that it chose to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4830.4s	4830.4	 Because we wouldn't be able to sleep as well as at night if cuba had nukes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4835.2s	4835.2	 Pointed at us with a first strike capability. We've had this conversation. Do you think nato should invite sweden?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4840.7s	4840.7	 Should sweden finland be invited into nato?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4843.8s	4843.8	 I I would table that issue until the war is over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4845.9s	4845.9	 I don't know why we need to basically deal with that right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4848.2s	4848.2	 But listen, we don't even have to go back to the cuban missile crisis right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4851.9s	4851.9	 Okay, there's a country called the solomon islands about 3 000 miles off the australian coast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4857.3s	4857.3	 They entered into a deal with china security deal and the u.s. Have been up in arms about that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4862.4s	4862.4	 So, you know and the reason is we don't want china extending its footprint
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4867.3s	4867.3	 In asia, okay, so we treat that deal as having a security externality for us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4873.2s	4873.2	 And yet we refused last year to recognize that there would be any security externality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4878.4s	4878.4	 For russia if we brought ukraine into nato
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4881.6s	4881.6	 The russians were abundantly clear about what they needed. So my point is this conversation on the pot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4886.4s	4886.4	 Yes, my point is this that this war was easily avoidable through the use of diplomacy the administration chose you believe that you don't know that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4894.3s	4894.3	 You believe that you don't know that you don't even try it. We never even tried
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4897.9s	4897.9	 It depends. We actually don't know that you actually don't know that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4900.8s	4900.8	 It's worse than that jason because here's what happened after the june 16th summit in geneva between putin and biden last year. Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4908.9s	4908.9	 Putin tells biden to his face. This is a red line as they've always said so what does the administration do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4915.2s	4915.2	 Not only do they not negotiate with the russians. They invite zelensky to the white house on september 1st of last year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4921.1s	4921.1	 Yeah, we talked about that. Hold on a second. Then on november 10th, they published a massive 10-year charter agreement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4926.1s	4926.1	 This was a huge finger in the eye to the russians
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4929.4s	4929.4	 And on the heels of that november 10th charter agreement the russians basically delivered an ultimatum to the u.s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4934.0s	4934.0	 Demanding a written guarantee that ukraine not joined nato and then in january blinken was tasked with negotiating with lavrov
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4940.3s	4940.3	 And blinken said there has been no change. There will be no change nato's door is open and will remain open
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4946.4s	4946.4	 This administration was incredibly stubborn. They were absolutely refused to use diplomacy to defuse the crisis now you say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4952.9s	4952.9	 Well, we can't know what we would have done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4955.0s	4955.0	 Well, but the point is they never tried
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4958.5s	4958.5	 Is the ukraine a sovereign country?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4960.6s	4960.6	 Yeah, they are but do they get to pick what they do in their fate?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4964.0s	4964.0	 Look this idea that they get to pick their fate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4967.3s	4967.3	 As a sovereign country, I think you would agree. Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4969.8s	4969.8	 Okay. Well, here's the question is your what you're trying to do and is is create a doctrine. Okay, you're trying to create a new doctrine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4977.9s	4977.9	 That a country gets to join whatever security alliance they want whatever military alliance they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4983.7s	4983.7	 That is not a doctrine we believe in when it comes to the solomon islands
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4986.8s	4986.8	 It's not a doctrine we believe in with respect to cuba and the cuban missile crisis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4990.4s	4990.4	 And the fact of the matter is is that the nations of the world are engaged in security competition and the and if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=4997.0s	4997.0	 If a country like ukraine joins a new military alliance that has huge externalities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5002.7s	5002.7	 And so we do not believe in that doctrine jason. This is a doctrine that did not exist until february
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5009.6s	5009.6	 Wait, we don't believe more people should be able to join nato
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5012.9s	5012.9	 While sweden and finland are clearly believe that but this this doctrine that the countries of the world should be able to join
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5017.8s	5017.8	 Whatever military alliance they want that is not that is not we do not practice that doctrine. That is not a doctor. We believe in cuba
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5026.1s	5026.1	 Cuba and then more recently the solomon islands. Okay. Yeah, I mean listen I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5030.2s	5030.2	 I'm not saying this war is not a mess all wars tend to be a mess
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5033.9s	5033.9	 I'm not saying we shouldn't try to resolve it with everything we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5036.6s	5036.6	 I do think the people of the ukraine and you know get to pick their fate and and I am in support
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5041.2s	5041.2	 Listen, I think I am in support of the of nato being stronger and stronger and i'm in favor of isolating putin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5048.2s	5048.2	 Uh, you know and using diplomacy as the primary tactic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5052.0s	5052.0	 To do that and making sure it doesn't run over countries because he won't stop at one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5055.4s	5055.4	 I think that's the the big question. I think is will he stop at one. Do you think he'll stop at one country?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5060.9s	5060.9	 Listen has proven he won't you just said you are you okay with stopping him?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5065.5s	5065.5	 Listen, you you just said that you want to use diplomacy as the primary tactic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5070.0s	5070.0	 Okay, so we agree on that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5071.5s	5071.5	 The question is what you're willing to give up because the administration was not willing to engage on the key russian concern
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5077.2s	5077.2	 Which is the admission let me ask you one Ukraine into nato. Do you think russia will stop?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5082.0s	5082.0	 With ukraine or donbass. Do you think that's actually the stopping point for putin?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5086.3s	5086.3	 Listen, I think there's a few ways to come at that question. One is to ask what is the motivation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5090.4s	5090.4	 Which is very hard to know because it's inside putin's head. Okay, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5093.9s	5093.9	 The second is what are their interests and the third is what are their capabilities?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5097.6s	5097.6	 The capabilities question is pretty easy to answer. I mean they have had a very hard time winning this war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5103.6s	5103.6	 They've won this eastern region of the donbass because I think why is that why do they have a hard time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5110.5s	5110.5	 Well, because their military capabilities are obviously not as great as people thought and and the nato ukraine got a lot of weapons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5116.8s	5116.8	 From the west from from nato exactly. So this idea listen i've said it before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5121.7s	5121.7	 The eu's gdp is 10 times greater
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5125.9s	5125.9	 Than russia's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5127.2s	5127.2	 And you know economic strength is the foundation for military strength. Moreover, we've seen that these nato weapons are incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5133.5s	5133.5	 The us's weaponry. I mean it's so you're in support of providing weapons to ukraine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5138.8s	5138.8	 nato
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5139.8s	5139.8	 The eu european countries i'm not in favor of creating a forever war in eastern europe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5145.7s	5145.7	 That is what's in the cards. No, but the question is jason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5149.3s	5149.3	 You just said that we have to isolate putin we have to deprive him of any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5153.9s	5153.9	 Of any positive outcome from this war. No, no, no, I said we have to stop him from evading countries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5159.2s	5159.2	 That's what we stop him from evading more countries that are he's not going to invade nato
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5162.4s	5162.4	 He's not going to invade nato countries because he's so outmatched well not nato
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5165.3s	5165.3	 But I mean there's a lot of countries that are not in nato
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5167.2s	5167.2	 So I mean, I think that's the thing but I mean listen we discussed this a million times here rule
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5170.6s	5170.6	 I think we both agree. We want the war to end
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5172.7s	5172.7	 I think we might just question is what are you willing to do to end the war?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5176.8s	5176.8	 And you know my point is this that the question is what is putin willing to do in terms of starting wars and invading other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5183.1s	5183.1	 Countries and what does the west have to do to react to that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5185.6s	5185.6	 You know, I think that's what we're talking about here. We didn't start this war, you know, but anyway, let's move on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5190.4s	5190.4	 I think well, hold on a second. We we have started this war but we failed to prevent it through the use of diplomacy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5195.2s	5195.2	 That's always been my point. Yeah, I think this war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5199.1s	5199.1	 I think this war was easily preventable if we had listened and engaged in diplomacy easily easily. Yes. Okay. Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5205.6s	5205.6	 I'm not sure that's what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5207.4s	5207.4	 Let me just tell you right now the deal that would end this war is the same deal that was on the table last year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5212.7s	5212.7	 With zero bloodshed, which is ukraine remains a neutral state. There's autonomy for the russian speakers in the donbass and kremia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5221.3s	5221.3	 Basically remains part of russia. That was the deal that is the deal that will be the deal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5226.0s	5226.0	 The only question is does the whole country have to be destroyed? All right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5230.0s	5230.0	 Well, we're going to find out in the coming months and does the world have to go through a global recession and famine?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5235.6s	5235.6	 These are big questions. Yeah, it's not the sacrifice it takes to stand up to dictators is very significant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5242.7s	5242.7	 And especially ones with nuclear bombs and it will be even worse with taiwan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5245.7s	5245.7	 I mean that if we think that this is difficult. Can you imagine this kind of escalation with a capable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5251.9s	5251.9	 Adversary if russia is not super capable and their weapons turned out to not be as strong my god
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5256.8s	5256.8	 What would taiwan look like? Did you guys read this story where um, it was the deputy foreign minister got demoted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5264.4s	5264.4	 and there was all this, um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5267.4s	5267.4	 Speculation like why did he get demoted and one of the things that came out was that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5273.9s	5273.9	 you know, he was very very pro russia and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5277.6s	5277.6	 And she is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5279.1s	5279.1	 And g is not and g is much more hedged and moderate and yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5283.1s	5283.1	 You know wanted to have more optionality and felt that he was cornered because I think there was some what was the quote?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5288.3s	5288.3	 I mean nick you can pull it but it was something about like, you know the the strength between basically china and russia is infinite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5295.2s	5295.2	 But that was that was a quote that he said that was a little bit off the reservation it seems and so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5300.6s	5300.6	 Yeah, yeah. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5302.6s	5302.6	 No, it's an important story as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5304.3s	5304.3	 I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5305.1s	5305.1	 And you know, it's one of the things that we can look at what's happening in these political situations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5308.5s	5308.5	 I think we probably have 50 60 70 percent of the information not even not even really quick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5313.6s	5313.6	 Tell us what's going on in alphafold world salt enough. There was a paper published about two weeks ago in the journal science
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5320.0s	5320.0	 it's actually um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5321.7s	5321.7	 An important paper because it used alphafold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5325.7s	5325.7	 to do some really important work and the work is to actually create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5330.5s	5330.5	 a 3d
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5332.0s	5332.0	 structure 3d model
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5334.0s	5334.0	 of the nuclear pore complex and that nuclear pore complex is really the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5339.4s	5339.4	 Scaffolding that makes up the nucleus of a cell so all eukaryotes, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5344.8s	5344.8	 All plants and animals have a nucleus in ourselves and the nucleus holds the dna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5350.8s	5350.8	 And the big question freeburg's internet connection is getting bored
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5359.2s	5359.2	 Just let him finish his sentence did it break up yeah, you're fine keep going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5363.0s	5363.0	 Your internet connection fell asleep because it was so boring what you're talking about keep going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5368.0s	5368.0	 So what does this mean in terms of well, hold on so um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5371.6s	5371.6	 so what this team did and this is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5374.4s	5374.4	 The problem that's uh kind of been around for decades
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5378.1s	5378.1	 Is we've never really understood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5380.7s	5380.7	 What the physical structure of the nucleus in a cell looks like and this is important because the physical structure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5387.1s	5387.1	 Regulates how molecules get into and out of the nucleus and how dna is expressed and how the rna that comes out of the dna

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5400.3s	5400.3	 That dysfunction in the nuclear pores or the nuclear pore complex in the cell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5406.4s	5406.4	 Um can lead to things like viral infection brain injury
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5410.3s	5410.3	 cancers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5412.1s	5412.1	 Cardiovascular disease many diseases their underlying driver may result from dysfunction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5418.4s	5418.4	 In the transmission of molecules into and out of the nucleus of the cell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5423.1s	5423.1	 And so scientists have always tried to figure out what does that transport mechanism look like? What does that infrastructure?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5429.0s	5429.0	 look like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5430.2s	5430.2	 And um, so for the first time and scientists have published theories on this and they've shown using x-ray
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5436.8s	5436.8	 imaging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5438.1s	5438.1	 You know some theory around what these complexes look like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5441.3s	5441.3	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5442.0s	5442.0	 And what this team at harvard did that they published two weeks ago is a really groundbreaking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5447.9s	5447.9	 Extremely detailed view of the entire nuclear comp a nuclear pore complex around the nucleus of the cell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5454.8s	5454.8	 By combining both x-ray imaging and alpha fold and so what they did is they took the predicted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5461.7s	5461.7	 physical structure of those proteins from alpha fold and use that to construct a sample of what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5469.2s	5469.2	 You know the nuclear pore complex looks how do they know it's accurate?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5472.3s	5472.3	 And so using this x-ray imaging they've been able to kind of verify some of the assumptions of alpha fold yields
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5478.1s	5478.1	 And now they've created this 3d model and this 3d model now gives and by the way just to think about this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5483.8s	5483.8	 Physically what it means like for a second the nuclear pore complex think about it as like a fence like a spherical fence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5490.3s	5490.3	 That sits around the nucleus and some parts of that fence open and close
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5494.5s	5494.5	 Some parts are static and the way that certain things open and close and what can fit through them and how they fit through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5500.0s	5500.0	 And how stuff gets stuck is really important to understand as a way to both
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5504.7s	5504.7	 Um understand the underlying cause of diseases like cancer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5508.4s	5508.4	 But also how we can create therapeutics and how we can target specific things that we can fix
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5513.3s	5513.3	 And how we can get molecules into the nucleus of the cell to regulate dna expression and edit the dna inside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5519.6s	5519.6	 That's mind-blowing. So wait if I were to translate this from nerd
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5522.9s	5522.9	 You basically alpha fold predicted no i'm being sincere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5526.9s	5526.9	 There's a map here that we were not able to see through x-rays and through, you know physics physics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5533.5s	5533.5	 But alpha fold predicted some of that and filled in the gaps. So now we have the map has been filled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5538.3s	5538.3	 That's a great that's a great way to describe it and so now we have this incredibly detailed 3d image and nick can share the images on our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5544.9s	5544.9	 youtube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5546.4s	5546.4	 Stream here of what the nuclear pore complex looks like and how each of those pores work. How do they open and close?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5552.5s	5552.5	 What's the structure of them? This isn't simply like a circle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5555.7s	5555.7	 This is like all these weird tentacles and little things sticking out and that can help us predict what molecules get stuck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5562.0s	5562.0	 And how one error in one of those proteins can cause things to get started like a cancer or something like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5567.6s	5567.6	 Yeah, how this can cause certain dna to be over expressed or under expressed causing things like cancer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5573.2s	5573.2	 So we're gonna live forever a whole new area of research in medicine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5577.4s	5577.4	 Gene therapy and new things that we can think about targeting to fix a lot of these underlying diseases
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5583.2s	5583.2	 And so this was a groundbreaking paper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5585.2s	5585.2	 Incredible what's the name of the paper? Can we just get the name of the paper so people can google it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5588.4s	5588.4	 We'll put it in the show notes as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5590.1s	5590.1	 Uh, there's been an amazing episode. Yeah, so it's a team out of harvard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5593.5s	5593.5	 We'll send the link in the in the show notes structure of cytoplasmic ring of nuclear pore complex by integrative cryo em and alpha fold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5601.0s	5601.0	 Terrible naming not for the general audience. No, no, it's okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5603.8s	5603.8	 sax is printing it out right now and he's going to use it for his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5608.0s	5608.0	 His new kittens little box, but I just want to highlight, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5610.0s	5610.0	 Because we talked about alpha fold I think last year or the year before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5613.2s	5613.2	 And how it was going to open up all these new areas of research and here we are a year later
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5617.2s	5617.2	 Incredible example of how alpha fold's been used to solve this really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5621.6s	5621.6	 Misunderstood or never really well understood aspect of biology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5625.6s	5625.6	 That is at the root cause of so much of disease and creates all this opportunity for medicine and therapeutics research and discovery
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5632.0s	5632.0	 All right, this is ben. It's great. It's great to see this breakthrough. Sorry. We didn't get to january 6th or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5637.1s	5637.1	 Roe v wade we'll get to those the next episode and we'll see no listen. I think roe v wade i'm not sure there's uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5642.4s	5642.4	 I mean we can do something about the reactions, but we did a pretty thorough episode
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5646.0s	5646.0	 So folks really want us to double click we double clicked with two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5649.6s	5649.6	 Of the most political constitutional experts in the space when it first got leaked, so please go and watch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5655.1s	5655.1	 Yeah, or listen to that. All right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5657.2s	5657.2	 Which episode is that number? I don't know which we'll put it in the show notes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrOjNsPzww&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=37&t=5660.0s	5660.0	 It'll be in the show notes for everybody and we'll see you all next time. Bye. Bye
