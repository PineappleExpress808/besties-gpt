https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everybody, welcome to another all in podcast. This is an all bestie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=5.7s	5.7	 No guesty episode of all in the last time you heard from the besties
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=11.7s	11.7	 It was election night and it was a shit show a fucking crazy shit show. Let's be honest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=19.4s	19.4	 I mean we if we go back and look at that historical document
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=24.6s	24.6	 We had moments where we thought Trump was gonna absolutely crush
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=28.8s	28.8	 Then we had moments of confusion and now here we are and I think we have to give a couple of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=36.4s	36.4	 bestie kudos to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=38.7s	38.7	 first off Chamath
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=41.1s	41.1	 Pointing out Pennsylvania was gonna be big and then second when we went through the possible scenarios of who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=49.2s	49.2	 What what could possibly happen a big giant blue wave?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=54.2s	54.2	 Trump winning it all and then maybe something in the middle option three came through and that was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=61.0s	61.0	 Saxie poo nailed it. I think that was your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=64.0s	64.0	 Saw assumption sacks the saw landing the soft landing. Yeah, so why don't we just for the people who didn't tune in live?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=72.1s	72.1	 Sorry, Jason. Can I ask a question? Saxie poo. Saxie poo was that your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=76.6s	76.6	 Like projection or was it from that from that guy who lives in his dad's basement his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=85.0s	85.0	 My researcher well Newman Newman works for me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=90.4s	90.4	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=91.5s	91.5	 Newman
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=92.6s	92.6	 Even I worked work together on on those takes but yeah the the take that we thought was was possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=99.3s	99.3	 But probably unlikely but could represent a really good scenario was the the soft landing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=104.7s	104.7	 Where you get a split decision and I think that's what the American people voted for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=110.2s	110.2	 You know you had the the Democratic frame on the election was that we needed a return to normalcy and decency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=115.6s	115.6	 The Republican frame was that the radical left cannot be trusted with power and voters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=120.2s	120.2	 Basically said they were both right. They sort of surgically removed Donald Trump while
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=124.9s	124.9	 thwarting the radical left's dream of total control in Washington and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=129.4s	129.4	 What the electorate seems to be saying is they want the parties now to work together instead of voting for extreme ideology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=135.6s	135.6	 But TBD sacks, I mean Georgia's still up for grabs. They're gonna go after it hard, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=142.1s	142.1	 They filed in Pennsylvania
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=145.0s	145.0	 Yeah, so I think there's a series of of core challenges we can talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=148.2s	148.2	 I think that they're unlikely to prevail very very unlikely. I think Joe Biden will be the next president
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=154.8s	154.8	 We can kind of compare this to you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=158.0s	158.0	 Bush v Gore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=159.7s	159.7	 From 2000 and if you you want to compare Trump's case to Gore's case, it's weaker in every respect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=167.4s	167.4	 I mean first of all with Bush v Gore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=170.7s	170.7	 Gore only had to overturn one state which was Florida whereas Trump has to now contest and overturn three or four states simultaneously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=178.8s	178.8	 Second, you know Gore was within a few hundred votes of Bush. It was extremely close
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=182.8s	182.8	 Trump is no closer than about 12,000 votes in Georgia. That's the closest one third, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=189.8s	189.8	 Gore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=191.0s	191.0	 or Bush never trailed Gore in any in any recount and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=196.4s	196.4	 And Trump has that problem that he's never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=199.8s	199.8	 And he's very far behind Gore as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=202.2s	202.2	 So you look at those three things and you'd say, you know Gore couldn't overcome it and he had a closer situation than this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=208.6s	208.6	 And of course, I'd say finally, you know a W had the velvet hammer James Baker working for him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=214.5s	214.5	 Whereas Trump frankly has Rudy Giuliani who's throwing press conferences in the parking lot of forces and landscaping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=222.2s	222.2	 Between a dildo shop and a crematorium
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=226.0s	226.0	 I mean you can't make this stuff up. I think somebody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=229.6s	229.6	 Somebody was tweeting, you know, it's this is perfect because you know, they were saying they wanted Rudy to fuck off and die
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=235.2s	235.2	 So it was so appropriate that this press conference was held between a dildo shop and a crematorium
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=240.9s	240.9	 So, you know, it's not exactly the a team that Trump's got playing for him here in the courts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=247.2s	247.2	 But I mean David Bossie by the way, David Bossie who was in charge of the whole thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=251.7s	251.7	 David Bossie is not even a lawyer and then he gets COVID and so now he's on the sidelines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=256.7s	256.7	 I mean just there's so many angles we can take here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=262.2s	262.2	 including the fact that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=264.6s	264.6	 Am I correct that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=267.4s	267.4	 Trump's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=269.0s	269.0	 campaign advisor got COVID
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=271.7s	271.7	 Like the day after or no no mark Meadows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=275.3s	275.3	 Even staff got it but David Bossie who's in charge of this whole recount process got COVID as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=281.2s	281.2	 Okay, so I want to just shift us now to what could have so many things went right for the Democrats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=289.6s	289.6	 but there was also something very clear here that happened which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=294.2s	294.2	 the what I call the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=297.5s	297.5	 HSP the hysterical socialist party of America, I think was dealt a death blow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=303.7s	303.7	 if you look this was very close and so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=308.1s	308.1	 You know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=309.8s	309.8	 Even if we want to talk look talk about the Electoral College, etc. These are still very low numbers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=314.9s	314.9	 I believe if the Pfizer news comes out last week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=319.6s	319.6	 Trump wins or if any combination
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=324.4s	324.4	 Of AOC Biden AOC Bernie or Warren were in any way involved in this election process
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=332.3s	332.3	 and Warren pushed to the side the squad was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=336.2s	336.2	 Squashed because we knew that if they got any kind of play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=342.0s	342.0	 Trump sells into victory. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=344.9s	344.9	 When we look at what happens going forward and I'll let any one of the three of you take this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=350.6s	350.6	 What does this say about the hysterical socialist party the HSP the squad the Bernie bros
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=358.3s	358.3	 What does this say about them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=360.3s	360.3	 well, you have a you have a look you have a you have a loud group of people on both sides and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=366.9s	366.9	 The reality is that both?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=369.8s	369.8	 Extremes of both parties actually after this election have very little to stand on that's unique
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=376.8s	376.8	 because if you think about what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=379.2s	379.2	 The plurality of Americans want is actually just a common decent centrist do-no-harm alternative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=386.3s	386.3	 And they're going to pick that more times than they're not going to pick it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=390.7s	390.7	 It's only when things get extreme like in 2016 in order to send a message will they do it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=396.1s	396.1	 And until it's resolved they tried to do it again now. So we should actually talk about that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=400.5s	400.5	 I don't think that this was you know a runaway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=403.3s	403.3	 It was way too close on too many dimensions that actually matter for the future prosperity of America
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=408.4s	408.4	 But that being said what does it mean for the future? I think the future is like a Pete Buttigieg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=413.5s	413.5	 Must be high-fiving. You know the people in his camp right now because a common decent thoughtful centrist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=422.5s	422.5	 Platform will win for example, like let's just say you believe in gay rights
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=426.5s	426.5	 Guess what? You don't need to be at the fringes to believe in that that's mainstream
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=429.4s	429.4	 You believe in like a reasonable form of health care. That's mainstream if you believe in climate change, it's mainstream
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=434.9s	434.9	 You start to go and tick off the things that the extremes would want to believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=439.6s	439.6	 there's very little room for them to stand on so one party is going to be basically about like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=445.0s	445.0	 Federalized nanny state and the other party will be a bunch of conspiracy theorists crazies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=450.3s	450.3	 And I think it's gonna force more and more people to the middle. I think that's the future to me. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=455.7s	455.7	 That's a much safer place to be than I think where we could have been if you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=460.1s	460.1	 Trump had won or if the extreme left had basically been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=465.2s	465.2	 Been validated with a candidate that one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=468.0s	468.0	 Right, and I would add to that that the the proof of that the proof of the electorate's desired attack towards the center
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=474.6s	474.6	 Is you look at the down ballot?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=476.9s	476.9	 Election so, you know in the Senate the Republicans are still holding on to a majority pending the Florida
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=483.7s	483.7	 Runoff, but the the Democrats failed to take out Susan Collins Tom Tiller Steve Daines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=489.2s	489.2	 These were three incumbent Republicans who were way behind in the polls heading into Election Day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=494.2s	494.2	 They didn't come close to taking out Lindsey Graham or Mitch McConnell despite spending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=498.9s	498.9	 Get out of this one alive explain that Susan Collins. No lady G
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=504.2s	504.2	 Lindsey Graham. Oh, I see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=506.3s	506.3	 You know Lindsey Graham. They said that it was neck-and-neck and he actually ended up winning that state by like 14 points
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=511.8s	511.8	 it wasn't close the polls were wildly off and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=515.4s	515.4	 And you saw that across across the board in the house to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=519.8s	519.8	 Democrats expected a gain of 10 to 15 seats instead. They've lost about 10 seats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=524.4s	524.4	 They failed to defeat a single GOP incumbent the GOP house members ran about two or three points ahead of President Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=533.2s	533.2	 And that and then the Democrats were completely shut out in Texas, which was supposed to be going purple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=537.7s	537.7	 There were eight open GOP seats Democrats won none of them. So this you know, so anyway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=543.4s	543.4	 I'm providing some support to the idea that this was a split decision election the voters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=549.8s	549.8	 Voted to remove both of the or to vote it against the extremes of both parties
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=554.5s	554.5	 So Friedberg when you look at this you see I think an absolute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=563.1s	563.1	 Just people don't want to deal with Trump anymore how much of this do you think is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=568.5s	568.5	 Trump derangement system as a syndrome and what got Trump into office
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=573.4s	573.4	 Eventually taking him out which is the guy just takes up too much oxygen in the room and that's coming for me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=581.1s	581.1	 And the guy is just incredibly annoying to have to deal with day to day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=586.1s	586.1	 That's also coming from you and that's also coming from me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=590.9s	590.9	 I think we've I think we've been at a rave for four years and everyone's like coming down from the Mali and you're not gonna go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=597.5s	597.5	 Maryland Manson concert like right after being at a rave like you want to go sit in the parking lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=602.8s	602.8	 And you just want to chill out a little bit and we all just want to like have a beer and relax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=607.2s	607.2	 You know, like I mean, I think that needs some 5 HTTP and a banana
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=610.8s	610.8	 you just yeah, you you want to go sit in the 7-eleven parking lot at 4 in the morning and you want to like go get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=616.1s	616.1	 A fucking sweet cappuccino and smoke a cigarette and relax like it's been it's been too much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=621.0s	621.0	 And I think it's like everyone's just kind of ready to chill out a bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=624.3s	624.3	 And so this whole fucking swinging back to the you know to the concert across the road sounds just as bad as what we've just been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=630.5s	630.5	 Through so let's just you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=632.5s	632.5	 Let's just live our lives a little bit and you know, we'll come back in four years and figure out how to fuck things up again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=637.8s	637.8	 I think that's kind of the psyche. That's right. I think that I think voters want a presidency they can forget about you know, I think Trump's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=644.9s	644.9	 Sort of Achilles heel as he demanded too much of the voters constant time and attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=649.2s	649.2	 There was like this psychic cost to it. It obviously antagonized the other side and drove turnout for the Democrats, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=655.4s	655.4	 But it seems like voters are saying look just leave us alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=658.4s	658.4	 We want to just forget about what's happening in Washington for four years and now they can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=662.4s	662.4	 Because you know pending the Georgia runoff it looks like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=665.7s	665.7	 Mitch McConnell and Joe Biden will have to be in a power-sharing arrangement and nothing gets done unless the two of them agree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=671.2s	671.2	 And by the way just on that there was a great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=674.2s	674.2	 Tweet by Paul Graham
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=675.6s	675.6	 He said the day after the election something to the effect of it feels like some background process in my computer had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=682.2s	682.2	 was just killed that was consuming 5% of my CPU and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=686.3s	686.3	 It's and it's so true Mac operating system spinning wheel of death
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=691.8s	691.8	 But it's it's David is so right. It's like, you know, it's been this omnipresent thing in all of our lives over the last four years and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=699.6s	699.6	 it's just exhausting and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=702.0s	702.0	 You know there wasn't that much value that came from paying so much attention and worrying so much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=708.0s	708.0	 And so it's just a great opportunity to come off the sugar high and reset ourselves and take a nap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=715.7s	715.7	 I think that's a very astute point to mouth in that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=719.0s	719.0	 What what it was gained?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=721.7s	721.7	 from this Trump derangement from this Trump sucking all of the attention and constantly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=729.0s	729.0	 tweeting and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=730.4s	730.4	 You know, I think the big win here free Berg is if you look the proof is in the pudding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=736.5s	736.5	 Trump we find out on Saturday morning that Trump is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=740.6s	740.6	 Is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=741.8s	741.8	 You know has lost and Biden has won and 48 hours later we find out Pfizer has 90% efficacy on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=749.5s	749.5	 Their vaccine obviously these two things are highly correlated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=754.2s	754.2	 Biden has already
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=756.0s	756.0	 Delivered the vaccine in just 48 hours. And then today we got the rapid testing has been approved by the FDA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=762.7s	762.7	 I mean look at this by if at this rate Biden's gonna cure global warming by the end of the year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=770.4s	770.4	 Look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=771.9s	771.9	 First off, I think it's a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=775.2s	775.2	 It is pretty paradoxical that yeah, the vaccine news came 48 hours. Yeah, and and it's paradoxical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=781.8s	781.8	 I mean that was crazy. I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=784.3s	784.3	 You know, there's supposed to be an october surprise not a november surprise. I think if trump has any legitimate argument about being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=791.5s	791.5	 done dirty in this election it is over this vaccine news because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=795.7s	795.7	 You know the the chinese announced at three hours after biden's declared president
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=799.5s	799.5	 Pfizer announces it a day after uh biden's declared president
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=803.2s	803.2	 I mean, you know when trump went around this the um, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=806.6s	806.6	 Was campaigning saying a vaccine was mere weeks away. Everyone thought that was bullshit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=810.4s	810.4	 But as it turns out he was telling the truth and if those guys had announced it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=813.9s	813.9	 Jason like you're saying two weeks before the election it might have changed this thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=817.4s	817.4	 But you guys might have a hundred hundred percent hundred percent and and this is not something he can go to the courts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=823.2s	823.2	 It's not like he can go to the courts and get the election recounted or overturned because of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=827.8s	827.8	 So it's not something that's legally actionable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=830.4s	830.4	 But I do think that on this news alone trump in four years will be able to claim on some level that this was a stolen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=837.3s	837.3	 Election, but couldn't the same be said about hillary's email server, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=841.4s	841.4	 So like 100 that news came out like oh and it was like timed around the election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=846.0s	846.0	 And I do think that there was a concerted effort to not let um, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=850.4s	850.4	 The progress with covet get in the way of the election in any way, you know biased it either way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=855.5s	855.5	 And I think it's like pretty reasonable and fair to say like let's just not make this part of the news cycle leading into the election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=861.4s	861.4	 and this was expected like if you guys go back a couple of podcasts like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=866.5s	866.5	 Um, you had a prediction on when we would have a vaccine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=869.2s	869.2	 I I think I predicted end of september
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=871.5s	871.5	 Because of the way that they set up the uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=873.4s	873.4	 The production cycle in parallel with the testing cycle and the way that they were fast tracking a lot of the testing in a way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=878.3s	878.3	 That wasn't normal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=879.5s	879.5	 um for this sort of a development and um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=883.1s	883.1	 It was it was going to happen this fall if i'm an executive at one of these companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=887.2s	887.2	 I don't want my vaccine to become a politicized event, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=889.8s	889.8	 Like I just want to be like I think it's it's the reasonable thing to say like let's just put it on hold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=893.7s	893.7	 Let's deal with it all after the election. We're still moving forward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=896.5s	896.5	 We're not holding anything up in terms of production and getting this thing across the finish line
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=900.1s	900.1	 It's just the announcement of where we are. So why make that part of the news cycle, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=905.0s	905.0	 Um, and I think like people learned their lesson with hillary's server last time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=908.9s	908.9	 It's like this one news, you know bombshell drops in the news cycle spins up and she loses the election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=914.8s	914.8	 Everyone blames her losing the election for that coming out. No one wants to be culpable for that, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=919.1s	919.1	 I'm a pfizer exec. I'm just trying to make fucking medicine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=921.1s	921.1	 Like I don't want to be on the the hook for said another way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=925.6s	925.6	 Said another way chamath nobody wants to go to a warriors finals game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=930.8s	930.8	 versus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=932.1s	932.1	 The lakers and have the refs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=934.6s	934.6	 Called, you know decide the game in the final couple of minutes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=938.0s	938.0	 So do you think chamath?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=940.0s	940.0	 this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=941.5s	941.5	 If you were running pfizer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=943.5s	943.5	 If you were on the board of pfizer and you have this information and you know, it can come out into this two-week window at any time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=950.3s	950.3	 What decision would you make chamath? Well just imagine that the vaccine was 90% ineffective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=956.6s	956.6	 And it was announced two weeks before the election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=959.1s	959.1	 Um, you'd have an entire cohort of people saying this was meant to basically sabotage the election in the other direction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=966.2s	966.2	 So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=967.1s	967.1	 The point is it's a no-win situation. The only answer is to wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=971.1s	971.1	 Until after the election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=973.7s	973.7	 Because that's the only way that you can actually say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=977.2s	977.2	 You know, we were not um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=979.5s	979.5	 We were being impartial so i'm sympathetic to this idea that all the news had to wait two or three days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=987.4s	987.4	 Or maybe it was two or three weeks now knowing in advance what the answer was obviously you can read into that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=994.3s	994.3	 Um, but I think even if it was 90% ineffective, it should have waited until after the election as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1000.1s	1000.1	 Saks I I just think that I don't get the sense that you do agree with that sacks. Well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1005.0s	1005.0	 Let's put this way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1005.8s	1005.8	 I mean we we know from our time working in large companies that it takes them weeks to even approve a press release
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1012.2s	1012.2	 And so pfizer had this news weeks ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1015.4s	1015.4	 um now I understand their reason for not wanting to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1020.2s	1020.2	 Appear to be influencing the outcome of the election. So I that's why they held on to it. I think everybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1025.8s	1025.8	 saw the way that facebook was scapegoated four years ago for the election and no one wants to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1031.2s	1031.2	 No corporation wants to put themselves in that position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1034.0s	1034.0	 Of being accused of affecting the election outcome one way or another i'm sure that's why they did it as opposed to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1039.4s	1039.4	 a conspiracy against trump, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1041.8s	1041.8	 You know this news was available. I think we will find out weeks ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1046.8s	1046.8	 And so I guess you'd have to blame or there would be some culpability on the part of trump's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1051.6s	1051.6	 election team or you know his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1054.4s	1054.4	 His head of the fda or what have you they must have known
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1058.0s	1058.0	 Some of this information and you would think they would have done a better job getting it out there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1061.8s	1061.8	 No, he did say at every rally. It's just around the corner. It's just around the corner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1066.3s	1066.3	 We're rounding the corner and we all thought it was bullshit. You thought it was bullshit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1069.7s	1069.7	 We thought it was bullshit, right? And you know why we thought it was bullshit. Well, because trump trump does have a tendency towards hyperbole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1076.2s	1076.2	 Hyperbole on trump's most honest day. He's hyperbolic on trump's average day. He is lying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1083.7s	1083.7	 incessantly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1085.0s	1085.0	 So if anything if he was right and he was right that we were turning the corner and the vaccine was coming and it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1091.3s	1091.3	 Going to be beautiful beautiful perfect vaccine and everybody was going to get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1096.5s	1096.5	 He's paying the price for being a liar for four years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1100.4s	1100.4	 Right, but it's the kind of thing. No, no, no boy who cried wolf
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1104.4s	1104.4	 Well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1105.4s	1105.4	 And so does the media by the way, but but yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1107.8s	1107.8	 Look in order for a piece of news this big to be believed before the election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1113.4s	1113.4	 it can't come from a candidate and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1116.6s	1116.6	 It's it's it's pretty amazing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1119.3s	1119.3	 None of this news got out there through some other source
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1122.1s	1122.1	 You would think that some of the people on the health care task force that trump appointed might have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1127.1s	1127.1	 You know surfacing this or paying attention to it. Maybe Pfizer did a really good job hiding it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1131.9s	1131.9	 I don't know, but um, it is pretty amazing that didn't come out sooner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1135.8s	1135.8	 Well, the the other crazy thing is like, you know, even the Pfizer team didn't exactly know what was going on the chief
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1141.6s	1141.6	 The the head of vaccine research
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1144.1s	1144.1	 She said we're not part of the federal government's, uh, you know warp speed program
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1149.4s	1149.4	 And then uh two days later Pfizer was like actually we are part of the warp speed program
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1154.5s	1154.5	 It's just that you know, we're a supplier. The whole point is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1157.4s	1157.4	 um, i'm not sure that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1159.8s	1159.8	 Pfizer actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1162.4s	1162.4	 Knew two weeks in advance david. I think that they were probably trickling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1166.5s	1166.5	 Stuff together and they probably had a sense of it at the end of the last week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1169.5s	1169.5	 I'm surprised it didn't leak to be quite honest. That's the more shocking thing, which means that um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1177.5s	1177.5	 It was probably something that uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1181.3s	1181.3	 Very very very few people knew about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1183.5s	1183.5	 Well, the ceo the ceo put out a statement saying that he would be first in line to take the new vaccine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1189.3s	1189.3	 Which I thought was you know a great statement because a lot of people were questioning whether you know how real it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1194.0s	1194.0	 Or how rushed it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1195.6s	1195.6	 But in order for him to do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1198.1s	1198.1	 And and in order just to get like a press release announced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1201.2s	1201.2	 I don't think that's the kind of thing that comes together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1203.9s	1203.9	 In the you know, one or two day period between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1207.0s	1207.0	 Uh the announcement of joe biden winning the election and their and their announcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1211.2s	1211.2	 So, you know, I I just think they had to know weeks ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1213.9s	1213.9	 I

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1240.1s	1240.1	 If you uh, if you if you take 90 efficacy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1244.2s	1244.2	 And you assume at most in the united states 40 percent of people will take the actual vaccination
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1249.9s	1249.9	 You'll have 36 percent of the population covered which is still not enough to get the r-naught less than one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1256.4s	1256.4	 Is that correct freeberg? What do you think? I don't know. I'm not an epidemiologist. I'd have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1261.8s	1261.8	 What I mean, does it sound directionally correct to you that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1265.4s	1265.4	 The people in the states are going to take it. I mean, I think if you don't take it, isn't this like uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1269.8s	1269.8	 Everyone who's high risk will take it. Yeah, and as of about two months ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1274.2s	1274.2	 You know, it was estimated that 30 percent of people on the east coast had already developed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1279.4s	1279.4	 Um immunity due to the seroprevalence studies that showed antibodies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1284.6s	1284.6	 On the west coast. It was much lower closer to three percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1287.3s	1287.3	 You could estimate based on the growth in cases since then and assuming we're kind of missing a bunch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1291.8s	1291.8	 We're probably on a national basis. We're at 10 back then on a national basis. You're probably up to 20 right now of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1299.1s	1299.1	 Americans have already been effectively immunized by getting the virus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1303.4s	1303.4	 so, you know if that's true, then you're at 55 percent and you're getting pretty close to a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1308.7s	1308.7	 um, you know an ability to kind of inhibit this thing from um,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1381.7s	1381.7	 Um immunization takes place regardless of how cheap and available testing is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1386.6s	1386.6	 We're going to have this scar for a long time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1389.2s	1389.2	 Um in terms of how we live as a society
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1392.0s	1392.0	 I don't think we should kid ourselves that we're going to go back to quote unquote normal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1396.2s	1396.2	 And I do think kids are going to get tested and schools are going to be like this friggin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1400.2s	1400.2	 You know almost like tsa's now, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1402.5s	1402.5	 Kids are going to go into school and get tested regularly and they're going to do all sorts of stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1406.2s	1406.2	 That we would have never dreamed imaginable in a free country a year ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1411.4s	1411.4	 And I think that's permanent. Um, I think you know, we're gonna you're already seeing people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1415.8s	1415.8	 Going nuts at bars and restaurants and people that have had it or out there partying and living their life again

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1427.4s	1427.4	 Yeah, but I don't think that that systems are going to change uh back to normal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1430.8s	1430.8	 I think systems have changed to the point that we've now got a way of living
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1435.2s	1435.2	 That we think is safer that we think is we we are now kind of inhibited because of the system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1440.9s	1440.9	 Chamath you agree? Yeah. Yeah, there'll be a lot fewer. It's what dave chappelle said on saturday
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1445.0s	1445.0	 There'll be a lot fewer mass shootings. The pandemic has done a great job of keeping the whites at home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1451.8s	1451.8	 We watched it together all you fucking besties watched it together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1456.2s	1456.2	 All you all you guys got on your mass shooting rant pages, you know, the whites are at home. They're frustrated, but they're at home. Thank god
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1462.4s	1462.4	 Uh, so I think there'll be some advantages. Well, I mean but let's talk about it chamath. Does does 2021 mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1468.3s	1468.3	 Kids go back to school 2021 september. No problem. No, I think free burger's right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1472.3s	1472.3	 I think that the best we'll get back to is sort of this 80 state and I don't think it happens until
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1477.3s	1477.3	 probably 2022 and maybe 2023 but probably 2022 because you have to remember like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1483.0s	1483.0	 We have to ramp up now billions of vaccine production. Like it's this is a non-trivial path from here to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1489.3s	1489.3	 quote unquote mass market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1491.3s	1491.3	 And uh, that takes a long time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1493.8s	1493.8	 I think we have to figure out how we're going to administer it by the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1496.7s	1496.7	 It's and and the way that the Pfizer vaccine works and maybe these other folks is you get the shot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1501.8s	1501.8	 And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1502.8s	1502.8	 You know three months three weeks later. I think you get a booster. So you have to take two cycles of this thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1507.8s	1507.8	 Um, and it's not gonna last forever and it's not gonna last forever. So this is uh, freeberg's right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1513.3s	1513.3	 It's the beginning of a very different way of living. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1516.8s	1516.8	 I think I think that the the good part about it is that um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1521.1s	1521.1	 You know, we've made a lot of changes that makes our lives a lot more efficient
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1524.6s	1524.6	 The bad part about it is we're even more detached from our neighbors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1528.6s	1528.6	 And you know, we're probably even more likely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1531.6s	1531.6	 To be a little bit more separated if we don't make an effort to be together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1536.8s	1536.8	 Sax do you buy this because I get the sense that you might be more optimistic than freeberg. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1543.8s	1543.8	 Chau I guess I guess I am I think covid is going to be a distant memory by next summer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1548.0s	1548.0	 I think we'll have one to two quarters of transition, but I think that once the vaccine's widely available
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1554.1s	1554.1	 Plus the treatment and the testings for the people who slip through the cracks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1558.2s	1558.2	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1559.3s	1559.3	 Yeah, I I tend to think things are going to snap back very fast and covid will just be this bad memory a very distant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1566.6s	1566.6	 Bad memory and I think in fact, I think things may bounce back the other way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1571.1s	1571.1	 Um, everyone having been cooped up and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1574.0s	1574.0	 Afraid of getting some life-threatening illness are going to come out of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1578.5s	1578.5	 Really wanting to party. I think the whole world's going to be like televiv for you know, a few months or something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1585.5s	1585.5	 And um, yeah, I mean I really do think it's going to bounce back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1588.6s	1588.6	 I think to the point politically where a few years from now people could ask wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1593.2s	1593.2	 Why why was it again that trump lost, you know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1596.2s	1596.2	 Um, you know this covid thing will be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1599.1s	1599.1	 It will be so in the rearview mirror that will wonder why we were so afraid of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1604.3s	1604.3	 I think this is i'm going to go with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1607.4s	1607.4	 David's sax's position here because of the simple fact that we had 130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1613.1s	1613.1	 Thousand confirmed cases, you know up until this election period the last week or so and deaths
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1620.2s	1620.2	 still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1621.4s	1621.4	 Not spiking. It's a little just a minor uptick. You know, we had a day with like, uh, I think maybe 1500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1627.1s	1627.1	 But still staying in that, you know, a thousand range even with cases spiking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1631.8s	1631.8	 And I think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1633.6s	1633.6	 we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1634.8s	1634.8	 Were so incompetent with test and trace in this country that we didn't see exactly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1641.0s	1641.0	 What happens in an authoritarian country?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1644.1s	1644.1	 Or a country that is lucky enough to be an island and has easy borders, which we almost do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1650.2s	1650.2	 I mean, we basically have two borders. We're like two-thirds of two, you know, 50 island, but hawaii

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1664.9s	1664.9	 Extremely extremely low death counts and extremely low case counts with the vaccine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1671.3s	1671.3	 Being half as effective as you know, uh, they claim and rapid testing which some of us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1678.0s	1678.0	 have uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1679.5s	1679.5	 No, some of us know people who have experienced rapid testing at homes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1684.3s	1684.3	 That combination I believe is going to make this go so low
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1688.2s	1688.2	 And the people who are high risk are still going to be scared staying home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1692.4s	1692.4	 I think

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1837.8s	1837.8	 The markets go up eight percent a year. So the do no harm solution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1843.6s	1843.6	 Is that things inflate naturally by eight percent, especially if those things are public stocks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1848.7s	1848.7	 So, you know the markets love the fact that there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1852.0s	1852.0	 Nothing that could theoretically get in the way of that natural eight percent and then when you layer on top of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1858.2s	1858.2	 As david said, uh all this free money. That's just like

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1864.4s	1864.4	 um, but you know, but you saw though that there was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1867.4s	1867.4	 A rotation right there was a rotation out of these high growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1870.4s	1870.4	 Software names particularly the work from home bid kind of got crushed, you know, I mean I think zoom was off

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1886.2s	1886.2	 So, I mean look the reality is the scary thing about all of this is if any of that stuff actually comes to pass
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1891.9s	1891.9	 We're going to see inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1893.5s	1893.5	 and the reason is because if you start going out and spending a bunch of money on tickets and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1898.1s	1898.1	 vacations and flights and this and that and pumping money into the economy and taking all that stimulus money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1903.4s	1903.4	 And putting it back to work prices will go up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1906.1s	1906.1	 um, and by the way, that's not such a bad thing for the economy which which needs a little bit of it, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1911.1s	1911.1	 Um, all of this is I think generally very very good news
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1915.6s	1915.6	 Friedberg, do you have a position on what you think will happen in the coming?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1920.4s	1920.4	 Let's let I would think the midterm is what people care most about so that would be let's call it two to six quarters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1927.4s	1927.4	 So there's one there's one potential speed bump still which is what I mentioned at the beginning which is georgia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1933.5s	1933.5	 uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1934.2s	1934.2	 The the democrats could still win both runoffs in georgia for senate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1939.7s	1939.7	 and they could um, because kamala harris would then have the breaking vote it would be a 50 republican 50 democrat senate and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1947.2s	1947.2	 And the vice president would uh would would break any ties
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1950.9s	1950.9	 The question is if you have that same turnout
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1953.2s	1953.2	 Where do the libertarians break because I think the libertarians were almost two percent of the vote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1957.4s	1957.4	 Well, I think yeah, what's interesting is um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1960.5s	1960.5	 The I don't know if you guys have but i've gotten emails from a lot of people asking me to donate money

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1980.3s	1980.3	 Don't you think sacs like probably north of 100 million dollars being spent maybe 100 to 200 million dollars being spent on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=1987.4s	1987.4	 Advertisements in georgia to try and get people to go vote one way or the other

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2002.6s	2002.6	 So everyone's rushing to georgia right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2005.7s	2005.7	 So the markets are going to have a very close eye on what's going on over there. I think um,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2250.8s	2250.8	 Well as it turns out, um promoting socialism to people who fled cuba nicaragua and venezuela to escape it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2258.7s	2258.7	 uh turns out not to be a great election strategy and um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2263.1s	2263.1	 And so yeah, it's this this idea that latin x is is one block. It's not it consists of a bunch of different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2270.1s	2270.1	 Of immigrants from a bunch of different nations and the ones who fled socialism are not eager to reenact it in the united states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2278.5s	2278.5	 the republicans flipped

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2287.9s	2287.9	 the heavily, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2290.3s	2290.3	 mexican-american counties, uh in along the rio grand in texas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2295.1s	2295.1	 trump improved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2297.5s	2297.5	 Let's see. It looks like he improved. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2300.6s	2300.6	 59 and 30 39 respectively over his uh, 2016 showing so this is not just some fluke of the exit polls
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2308.8s	2308.8	 it seems like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2310.1s	2310.1	 trump really made progress in a lot of these groups that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2313.6s	2313.6	 Seem to defy their you know what what the promoters of identity politics the way that they wanted them to vote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2320.5s	2320.5	 Gay americans were another one. I think trump improved his share of the gay vote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2325.1s	2325.1	 From 14 in 2016 to 28
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2329.2s	2329.2	 This year so, um, I mean really it's it's pretty amazing people are not voting the way that they're supposed to vote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2336.1s	2336.1	 um trump also improved from 12 to 18 with black men
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2340.1s	2340.1	 And four to eight percent of black women. I mean, those are still pretty low numbers, but there was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2344.5s	2344.5	 improvement there and I think part of the reason is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2347.3s	2347.3	 That not all of the african-american community is on board with defunding the police
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2351.9s	2351.9	 Well, I also think what it means is identity politics is a stupid strategy forget whether you're offended by it or not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2359.0s	2359.0	 At this point what's clear is it's a stupid fucking strategy. It doesn't work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2364.2s	2364.2	 It's a path to losing because the more and more you do it the more and more you're going to disenfranchise individuals who want to be judged
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2371.5s	2371.5	 Sort of of sound mind and body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2373.5s	2373.5	 Right. I mean if he took a thousand sri lankans and put him in a room and said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2377.1s	2377.1	 Jamal i'm going to judge you as a sri lankan vote. I would tell you to go fuck yourself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2381.6s	2381.6	 You know, I would be deeply offended by that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2383.9s	2383.9	 And this is where I think the radical left is going to have to retool because their theory of how they take power in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2389.4s	2389.4	 America was always that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2391.4s	2391.4	 Demographics is destiny that you know as the country simply becomes more diverse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2395.8s	2395.8	 We're gonna they're automatically going to vote for us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2398.7s	2398.7	 And there's a lot of data in this election to show that that's not what's going to happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2402.0s	2402.0	 You actually have to run on issues that people care about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2406.7s	2406.7	 Let's think about this in the context of internet advertising, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2411.0s	2411.0	 The the world prior to internet advertising you had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2415.5s	2415.5	 you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2416.7s	2416.7	 Channels and you would have an audience that was estimated to be made up of some demographic set on that channel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2422.6s	2422.6	 And you would buy an ad spot on that channel and that's who you would reach and so you would create a message for that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2427.1s	2427.1	 Now today we can create personalized ads and personalized messages
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2431.1s	2431.1	 And internet advertisers are much more thoughtful about targeting targeting based on psychographic profiling behavioral targeting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2438.3s	2438.3	 And I think that's where politics has to head in the united states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2441.5s	2441.5	 It's kind of keeping up with this personalization of both products
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2445.3s	2445.3	 But also of media and ads and and I think that's what we're going to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2449.2s	2449.2	 If you listen to james carville, who's like, you know a classic kind of democratic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2454.2s	2454.2	 campaign advisor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2456.1s	2456.1	 And he did a podcast just leading up to the election. And if you listen to this podcast these guys are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2461.5s	2461.5	 Very old school. It's like the whites are going to do this and the blacks are going to do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2464.9s	2464.9	 And the the the college educator are going to do this and the others are going to do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2468.3s	2468.3	 And they don't realize that the segmentation that's possible today. I think reveals a lot more about the character of the uh of the population
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2475.8s	2475.8	 They're basically I think it's such an astute point for eberg. They're basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2479.6s	2479.6	 Living in the level of granularity of network tv. It's like cable tv
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2484.3s	2484.3	 Yeah, it's like they got to cable tv and they're like, okay bet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2487.9s	2487.9	 Esp and nascar and guess what like like the world is much more complex individuals have found their own personal voice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2494.6s	2494.6	 And they found their own personal voice through social media through instagram through this ability to kind of define themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2500.7s	2500.7	 Not fit within a cohort and I think that's what maybe they always did feel that way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2505.0s	2505.0	 And we just had never had the technology to get there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2507.3s	2507.3	 Yeah, but I think it's I think it's also that people like people have complex points of view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2511.1s	2511.1	 You know the four of us sit here and none of neither of us none of us identify as a party anymore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2515.8s	2515.8	 We all identify with with um certain uh points that we think are important to us individually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2521.1s	2521.1	 And then we have a point of view on those points
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2523.2s	2523.2	 And I think that's the case for the majority of the population in the united states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2526.7s	2526.7	 I don't think people are like i'm just a fucking democrat no matter what and i'm a republican no matter what people care more deeply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2531.5s	2531.5	 In a more complex way and I think politics needs to resolve to that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2535.8s	2535.8	 And and that's going to require a shift in how you communicate how you message how you get feedback how you drive?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2541.3s	2541.3	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2542.3s	2542.3	 Blocks for voting and uh, it's gonna it's gonna uh, you know be a really interesting change over the next 15 to 20 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2548.4s	2548.4	 And it may be what saves the republic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2550.6s	2550.6	 I I think this is an incredible observation. I think it might be the observation of the episode
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2555.4s	2555.4	 And I just want to point to a tweet I did because this is this election has really led to me doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2562.1s	2562.1	 Um two things one i've been just thinking deeply about what do I actually understand about americans in america?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2569.4s	2569.4	 And then I also you know, there's all these red pills around so I decided I would crush up a red pill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2575.2s	2575.2	 And I would just you know put a little on my finger and I try a little red pill for a second
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2579.4s	2579.4	 Uh, and everybody told me i've been red-pilled now on twitter and then i'm a trump fan. I'm not I hate the guy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2584.7s	2584.7	 I think it's horrible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2586.3s	2586.3	 But I I did this quick survey here. I said if you voted for trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2589.9s	2589.9	 I want to understand what percentage of your vote vote was based on the combination of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2595.1s	2595.1	 A cancel culture b identity politics c socialism d coastal elites telling you how to live
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2600.7s	2600.7	 Explain other issues that contributed in a reply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2603.9s	2603.9	 Ie spending immigration sc the supreme court, etc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2607.5s	2607.5	 And I just said zero percent one to twenty five twenty six to fifty at over fifty and and I got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2614.6s	2614.6	 12,000 votes go ahead and look at the results
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2617.9s	2617.9	 Not the replies but go ahead and vote and it doesn't matter which one you pick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2622.1s	2622.1	 Over 50 percent of people who voted for trump, and I know this is unscientific. It's my followers, but it's definitely feels directionally correct
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2630.3s	2630.3	 The people who felt 26 to over 50 percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2635.0s	2635.0	 Was part of the cancel culture identity culture was what they were trying to communicate with their vote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2642.3s	2642.3	 Well, this is this is such an important thing because I think this is what we're fighting over every single
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2647.4s	2647.4	 70% of them no every single election going forward like if you if you put this on top of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2653.9s	2653.9	 70 odd million people that voted this kind of roughly makes sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2657.5s	2657.5	 Which is that you know, there's probably about 20 million people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2661.9s	2661.9	 Who will completely vote democrat no matter what and 20 million people who will completely vote republican no matter what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2669.0s	2669.0	 They're they're just eyes are closed. Their ears are closed. They don't care
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2673.3s	2673.3	 But when you take those people out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2675.3s	2675.3	 There's this enormous amount of people in the middle who have the ability to vote a split ticket
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2681.6s	2681.6	 You know and as and as and as saxi pu said like they'll vote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2685.1s	2685.1	 A democrat into the white house, but then down ballot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2689.1s	2689.1	 They'll vote a bunch of republicans and they'll just make sure there's a balance of power
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2693.6s	2693.6	 So they've been telling us about this kind of centricity for years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2696.9s	2696.9	 And so if you want to win an election you do two things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2700.0s	2700.0	 Part one is you understand this dynamic that centrism wins and part two is what friedberg says which is you understand that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2706.1s	2706.1	 We need to enter sort of the google cpc world of political advertising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2712.1s	2712.1	 And really cater not just the ads but also the message to individual people and stop the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2718.7s	2718.7	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2719.8s	2719.8	 You know the cat the the gross high level categorization which isn't working anymore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2725.4s	2725.4	 Yeah, and and and jason let me can I can I add?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2728.7s	2728.7	 the the connection between cancel culture and the selection so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2732.9s	2732.9	 You know, obviously the pollsters got everything completely wrong and again again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2738.4s	2738.4	 And but the reason is because of cancel culture so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2741.6s	2741.6	 In exit polling 45 percent of republicans with college degrees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2746.6s	2746.6	 Express fear that their careers could be at risk if their views became known compared to only 23 percent of democrats saying that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2753.4s	2753.4	 And so there were these, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2755.3s	2755.3	 Quote unquote shy trump voters who are afraid to tell pollsters what they really think now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2760.2s	2760.2	 It wasn't the trump voters that you think of when you see the pickup trucks and the convoys go by or the rallies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2766.9s	2766.9	 Sort of those the those were the voters from 2016 who weren't counted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2771.1s	2771.1	 It was sort of the non-college blue collar voters the michael moore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2774.8s	2774.8	 You know people who turned out for trump and big numbers and weren't properly counted four years ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2780.3s	2780.3	 The pollsters actually counted those people correctly this time the people they completely underestimated was actually the white college vote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2787.6s	2787.6	 Who swung for a lot of swung from democrat to republican?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2791.2s	2791.2	 They voted for trump because of this issue and they were afraid to say anything about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2795.4s	2795.4	 Because they're afraid of getting cancelled and by the way they they are every other person everybody listening to this podcast works with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2802.9s	2802.9	 And so deal with that one right exactly anybody who's not actively virtue signaling on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2808.8s	2808.8	 Twitter for biden is a trump voter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2813.2s	2813.2	 Not sure if that's exactly correct, but I don't think it's wrong roughly, you know if people aren't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2819.2s	2819.2	 If people in tech aren't explicitly endorsing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2823.3s	2823.3	 Uh biden on twitter, they're probably closet trump voters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2829.0s	2829.0	 It is going to be very interesting for people to go back to offices because now we have had a resolution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2837.0s	2837.0	 and identity politics cancel culture and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2840.7s	2840.7	 Extremism on both sides historical and trolling trolling republicans historical libs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2847.6s	2847.6	 This has been a loss for both of those parties and now the pandemic is ending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2853.6s	2853.6	 We're going to be back in offices at some point. I mean, what is office culture going to be like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2858.4s	2858.4	 Are people going to go with the brian armstrong?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2861.6s	2861.6	 Let's just get work done here. Let's not talk about politics. It's just too charged or not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2866.3s	2866.3	 Um, it's it's going to be a very interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2869.3s	2869.3	 It's every it's every comp it's every company's right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2873.9s	2873.9	 You know, it's every company's right to care about what they want to care about every board every ceo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2878.6s	2878.6	 Every controlling shareholder and then it's every employee's right to vote with their feet about whether that's okay or not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2884.8s	2884.8	 And I think that look I mean the whole brian armstrong thing again just to say one of the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2890.3s	2890.3	 Pathetically poorly written
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2892.4s	2892.4	 You know pieces of english pros i've ever fucking seen, you know, he's a crypto in fairness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2898.9s	2898.9	 My dog my dogs my dog he's not a coder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2902.1s	2902.1	 He's a ceo my dog slamming his her paw on the keyboard would have created a better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2906.8s	2906.8	 pros in that but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2908.6s	2908.6	 He was coming from a reasonable place. He had the right to say what he said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2912.7s	2912.7	 Um, the problem is that it's so antithetical to what you're allowed to believe for example living in san francisco
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2919.2s	2919.2	 Um, but I think that that's going to change because you can't ignore every other person telling you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2925.0s	2925.0	 That there are meaningful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2927.9s	2927.9	 Economic issues that matter and that the prioritization and the policing of these, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2934.1s	2934.1	 Sort of high value social signaling issues are no longer a priority
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2939.5s	2939.5	 And I think that what's going to happen is there will be room for a party that focuses on that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2945.2s	2945.2	 And a group of people but they will be relegated just like on the other side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2949.2s	2949.2	 Uh that will happen to the republican version of that as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2953.3s	2953.3	 I just think this whole thing this honesty for me it was it seems like such a tight election it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2958.8s	2958.8	 But I really think the huge winner here is centrism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2962.1s	2962.1	 balance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2963.5s	2963.5	 I I agree with that and I would say that this election proves that brian armstrong was right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2970.4s	2970.4	 Because the average american is tired of these highly charged political situations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2975.8s	2975.8	 And the last thing they want to do is have these conversations at work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2979.6s	2979.6	 Where they can get reported to where they can offend their co-workers and get reported to hr
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2984.2s	2984.2	 It can make them feel unsafe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2986.3s	2986.3	 Right exactly why we they they don't want to have these conversations at work. Certainly by the way only five percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2992.7s	2992.7	 Of coinbase's employees took armstrong up on that offer to leave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=2996.4s	2996.4	 So the number of people who actually want to have a politically charged workplace is very very small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3001.3s	3001.3	 They're just the noisiest. They're the squeakiest wheel. I mean, that was a ridiculous deal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3006.4s	3006.4	 I mean, what did he say six months and we vest as obvious made it really attractive to leave if you didn't agree with his policy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3011.9s	3011.9	 Was that written because I couldn't figure that out. Yeah, it was it was written
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3015.4s	3015.4	 It was an attractive deal to leave if you wanted to leave and 95 chose to sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3019.4s	3019.4	 Yeah, did I say it was poorly written? I didn't understand it because it was so poorly written. So anyway, so 90 95 percent stayed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3025.3s	3025.3	 So my point is just the number of people who actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3028.5s	3028.5	 Like this highly polarized politically charged situation in which we're all arguing with our friends over politics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3035.2s	3035.2	 And children are divorcing their parents because they're not woke enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3039.1s	3039.1	 I mean people don't want to live in that kind of country anymore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3042.2s	3042.2	 And I think this is the thing that joe biden really got right in his campaign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3046.0s	3046.0	 I mean, this is why I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3047.5s	3047.5	 This is the only way that his basement strategy could actually work and result in him getting elected elected
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3053.6s	3053.6	 Is people actually do want this return to normalcy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3057.2s	3057.2	 You know who the biggest loser is going to be coming out of this. I think not when you think holistically about the ecosystem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3063.5s	3063.5	 It's going to be the media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3065.3s	3065.3	 Because they have made an absolute fortune over the last four or five years picking aside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3073.4s	3073.4	 What is the point of watching rachel matto?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3076.4s	3076.4	 January 20th, what is the point of tuning into fox news or reading the hysterical opinion page of the new york times?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3084.6s	3084.6	 all of these places that were being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3087.2s	3087.2	 propped up by either trumpism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3090.2s	3090.2	 or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3091.7s	3091.7	 Anti trumpism are now going to find themselves where they started which is a job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3097.0s	3097.0	 Without a job and we just wanted you to tell us the news until it was a straight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3101.7s	3101.7	 There was a great article the new york times have an opinion page
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3106.1s	3106.1	 Rip the opinion page out of the new york times rip it out of the wall. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3112.3s	3112.3	 No, I disagree. I think the opposite happens which is that opinion page was meant to be where people could have an opinion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3118.5s	3118.5	 So that everything else was fact and the problem is that all the other pages became opinion as well. Nobody told anybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3125.1s	3125.1	 Yes, exactly, but nobody can tell the difference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3128.3s	3128.3	 With that expose, you can tell the difference. That's right. They can't tell the difference and look at that expose about how barry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3134.7s	3134.7	 Or barry weiss was run out of the new york times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3137.5s	3137.5	 It basically the activists ran her out

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3298.4s	3298.4	 The fact that the new york times doesn't feel like they're being objective anymore and they're you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3303.0s	3303.0	 They're running people out of the uh out of the newsroom in general. I just feel like we've been disenfranchised. Um,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3414.1s	3414.1	 The dude with the with the map and he kept touching the map and yeah

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3435.5s	3435.5	 And he was zooming into pennsylvania and he's like, oh, well, of course in 2018 this happened 2016

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3455.0s	3455.0	 I don't know. I don't know if I'd call him tom cruise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3457.8s	3457.8	 When I look like tom cruise, but the minority report pinch and zoom in and out it was incredible when uh, when when does trump call this thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3466.4s	3466.4	 That's a great question. Well, I think he has to run out these core challenges, which will take a few weeks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3471.3s	3471.3	 But I I predict by thanksgiving. Um, but it may have to go up to the stream court
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3475.8s	3475.8	 But he's gonna he's gonna dot the i dot every i and cross every t that he's got legally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3481.6s	3481.6	 Um, but he's got like we talked about the very beginning. He's got a huge uphill challenge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3485.7s	3485.7	 I see the court ultimately ruling against him or throwing it out. What is the point david?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3490.1s	3490.1	 What is well because why shouldn't he exhaust every he's not gonna win?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3494.4s	3494.4	 Well, I don't I don't know that he he knows that he he I think it's his right to exhaust every legal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3500.4s	3500.4	 Uh possibility and let's remember al gore didn't concede for 37 days after the election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3505.8s	3505.8	 So I certainly think trump is within his rights over the next few weeks to run this out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3510.6s	3510.6	 In terms of what the point is, I mean other than the obvious attempt to challenge it legally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3514.8s	3514.8	 I do think this is partly a branding exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3517.8s	3517.8	 by trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3518.8s	3518.8	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3519.9s	3519.9	 It's a marketing exercise. I don't think he's going to come up with enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3524.1s	3524.1	 Malfeasance to overturn an election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3526.5s	3526.5	 But I do think he'll probably produce a lot of smoke and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3530.0s	3530.0	 This is about protecting his brand as a as a winner and you know if he kicks up enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3535.7s	3535.7	 Um, you know examples of voter fraud or or what have you he'll always be able to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3542.0s	3542.0	 You know years from now that this was he was a stolen election and when you combine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3547.3s	3547.3	 The fact that covet really did drive this this election you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3552.1s	3552.1	 Call that chinese election interference if you want the fact that the vaccine is now here already you could call that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3558.2s	3558.2	 Um, you know some sort of election interference. He's gonna have enough arguments where if he wants to run four years from now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3565.2s	3565.2	 Um, I think he probably gets a republican nomination again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3568.1s	3568.1	 What what's the percentage chance?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3570.1s	3570.1	 Chamath that he runs again in four years zero

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3578.6s	3578.6	 I think he's gonna be making so much money. He's not gonna know what to do with himself

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3747.9s	3747.9	 Immoral it's customary and traditional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3751.4s	3751.4	 to concede your election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3753.5s	3753.5	 But you know december 15th is the date that congress ratifies the electoral votes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3759.5s	3759.5	 To determine who the next president is going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3761.8s	3761.8	 um, and these guys are just taking a very kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3766.4s	3766.4	 pragmatic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3768.0s	3768.0	 Legal line that is not immoral in a way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3771.0s	3771.0	 They they believe that they have some case on on what the vote should be the votes are all very close yada yada
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3776.1s	3776.1	 I'm not saying that he's gonna win by any chance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3778.8s	3778.8	 but I don't think that um folks saying like let the votes be counted and let congress do their job of having the states tell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3785.5s	3785.5	 Them who their electoral votes are going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3788.1s	3788.1	 Is uh is an inappropriate position to take I sound like I might sound like some conservative, you know trump head
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3794.7s	3794.7	 But i'm not I I think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3796.4s	3796.4	 Um, these guys what i'm just saying is that these guys aren't that immoral in in kind of asking for that for that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3801.4s	3801.4	 You know, sorry. I also think at the fringes of the republican party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3804.9s	3804.9	 This is what you keep all these militia folks and all these other folks at bay is just you show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3811.5s	3811.5	 a really methodical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3813.6s	3813.6	 um, you know, um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3815.7s	3815.7	 Stepping away from the spotlight and I think that this is you know, honestly, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3820.0s	3820.0	 This is a very deliberate safe calming thing to do because I think there's been nothing about the trump administration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3827.0s	3827.0	 From 2016 through to this very moment that has been customary or traditional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3831.3s	3831.3	 And so I don't know why we all expected him to step in and say like I concede like the way that we've been doing it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3836.1s	3836.1	 It would be worse if we were if he had conceded and all of a sudden was holding a bunch of protests and rallies all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3840.7s	3840.7	 Over the country that but he's not doing anything illegal. No one has any legal requirement to concede and um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3847.1s	3847.1	 You know, and I think as long as these guys on december 15th
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3850.0s	3850.0	 Which is the date that we should all be watching and waiting for as long as these guys do the appropriate thing at that point then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3855.8s	3855.8	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3856.5s	3856.5	 You know that that that's the only point in which I would have any sort of concern or worry about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3861.0s	3861.0	 What's going on with the transition in the government?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3862.8s	3862.8	 But sorry, I think this is about saving face and saving brand as saxi puss said he'll he'll be out by december 15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3868.9s	3868.9	 Meaning it'll this will all be done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3871.3s	3871.3	 Yeah, I agree and look let's remember that al gore was able to challenge the election result for 37 days without being hysterically accused of undermining democracy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3879.9s	3879.9	 So let trump have his day in court. It'll play out over the next few weeks. I expect that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3885.2s	3885.2	 The obstacles he have has to overcome are are too large and he will lose these lawsuits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3890.9s	3890.9	 It might go to the stream court. It would not be a bad thing if the stream court were the ones to make this decision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3897.1s	3897.1	 Uh, they're one of the last institutions that still trusted clearly the media are not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3901.6s	3901.6	 And I think that you know trump will accept the result
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3904.9s	3904.9	 He may not concede but he will accept the result when it comes from the stream court
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3910.1s	3910.1	 Is there a non-zero chance that he could win?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3912.9s	3912.9	 On a recount
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3915.4s	3915.4	 He would have to prove systemic fraud because it's not like florida where there's just one state and a few hundred votes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3922.1s	3922.1	 He's got to overcome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3923.8s	3923.8	 over 12 000 votes in at least three states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3928.0s	3928.0	 So that's the issue is is it's put a percent on it sax if you had to lay money on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3933.1s	3933.1	 Oh, I mean, it's like sub 10 chance. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3936.4s	3936.4	 Sub 10 chance one in 10 you'd give 10 to one odds. No, i'm saying it's under 10 percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3941.5s	3941.5	 I'm saying it's a very small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3943.8s	3943.8	 Well, here's the thing. So bush v gore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3946.5s	3946.5	 the um, the supreme court ruled seven to two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3950.8s	3950.8	 I mean you would have thought it was nine to zero
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3953.3s	3953.3	 Um, so clearly there were some sympathizers in bush v gore. So hopefully
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3957.7s	3957.7	 you know, it's something like seven to two and um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3961.0s	3961.0	 You know we move on I I believe if it gets the stream court it will be at least seven to two if not a one or nine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3966.9s	3966.9	 zero
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3967.9s	3967.9	 Just because I think trump has a much harder case to prove in florida the issue was simply whether the recount should be allowed to continue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3976.1s	3976.1	 James baker went to the supreme court to stop the recount that was in process
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3981.7s	3981.7	 Because of the fear that the local corrupt election officials basically steal the election for gore that you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3987.9s	3987.9	 But but but bush was always ahead in that election. There was never a time when bush was behind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=3994.2s	3994.2	 Um biden is now ahead in every swing state that matters trump has to now overturn that result in at least three of those states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4003.5s	4003.5	 I don't know how he does that by tens of thousands of I just don't know how he does that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4008.3s	4008.3	 He has to prove some sort of systemic fraud that took place across the nation

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4179.8s	4179.8	 For 99.999999 percent of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4184.1s	4184.1	 They're gonna shrug and say I don't give a shit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4186.1s	4186.1	 But there was this new tax of six percent for homes that get sold over 10 million dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4190.9s	4190.9	 Now, uh, if you're a successful entrepreneur an investor or a ceo of a company in san francisco, and you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4197.3s	4197.3	 It's it's like a slap in the face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4199.3s	4199.3	 Um, you add the business tax with that kind of high-end property tax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4203.6s	4203.6	 And it's almost like an invitation to leave the city and some people are nodding their head
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4207.3s	4207.3	 Wait, this six percent is on leaving or buying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4210.5s	4210.5	 Uh transaction when you sell so you literally six percent off the top
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4215.2s	4215.2	 When you sell a home the city basically just took six percent of my house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4219.1s	4219.1	 Yeah, the city just took six percent of my house. It's in a state tax. They're now a part owner of my house

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4240.3s	4240.3	 on the third floor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4241.6s	4241.6	 And they're they're all living there right now, but I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4245.3s	4245.3	 It's okay. I got like wings. I don't even know about it's like totally. It's like richie rich's house or something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4250.1s	4250.1	 So look, no, nobody cries nobody cries for super rich people and you know, but it was short-sighted is the point, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4257.5s	4257.5	 Right exactly. I'm not complaining about the taxes on me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4260.4s	4260.4	 But it's gonna do tremendous damage to the city people are not gonna want to move here and we yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4265.5s	4265.5	 Yeah, I look i've built businesses in san francisco since 2006 and I will not build another business in san francisco

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4274.8s	4274.8	 If you're going to build a business do it in the south bay do it in the east bay do it in the north bay or do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4278.9s	4278.9	 It in austin or la or somewhere else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4281.3s	4281.3	 But this is just not a place to build businesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4283.2s	4283.2	 The city is basically saying we don't want you here now that would be fine and dandy if the city was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4288.2s	4288.2	 Being conservative in the way that they spend and if they were actually reducing their budget and you know kind of reducing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4298.9s	4298.9	 Diverge with the budget because um the taxes are now going to go down because businesses are leaving people are selling their homes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4305.8s	4305.8	 They're not going to buy expensive homes anymore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4308.1s	4308.1	 And um, we are seeing a budget crisis san francisco. I think it's looking at a 1.7 to 2 billion dollar budget shortfall this year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4315.7s	4315.7	 Um, I mean like where's that money going to come from?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4318.1s	4318.1	 This is a city with 800 000 and we have and there was that expose in the san francisco chronicle talking about how there's over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4323.3s	4323.3	 20 000 city workers making over 150 000 a year 30 000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4327.7s	4327.7	 Yeah, what are we getting for all of that? The evidence is not apparent. Um, and this is where okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4333.7s	4333.7	 Look, i'd be happy to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4335.7s	4335.7	 Give the city six percent of my house and pay all these high taxes if we actually got something for it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4340.4s	4340.4	 But the city just keeps getting less and less livable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4344.1s	4344.1	 Yes city budget in 2013 and so we have a fiscal crisis a fiscal crisis and we have a livability crisis that I think is even worse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4352.4s	4352.4	 Um, and that that's a huge problem and let's be frank san francisco was always the accidental
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4358.5s	4358.5	 Beneficiary of silicon valley if you will san francisco was the accidental billionaire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4363.7s	4363.7	 It was silicon valley that created this enormous wealth and all the jobs and the companies it wasn't san francisco
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4370.1s	4370.1	 Policies or politics that created any of that it just so happens that silicon valley got big enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4375.0s	4375.0	 It started around stanford it got big enough that san francisco as the nearest metropolitan area
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4380.6s	4380.6	 Really was a beneficiary of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4382.6s	4382.6	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4383.7s	4383.7	 And you know because they never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4386.4s	4386.4	 Really did anything to create the conditions for that prosperity frankly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4389.5s	4389.5	 They took it for granted and now that the rug's been pulled out from under them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4392.7s	4392.7	 I don't think they're really gonna know what to do local local san francisco politicians treated silicon valley success as a grab bag
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4400.7s	4400.7	 and uh uber set up here and twitter and square and salesforce and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4407.2s	4407.2	 San francisco politicians put their hand in the honey jar and took as much as they could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4411.8s	4411.8	 And um, it's now backfiring because new businesses don't want to set up here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4415.9s	4415.9	 Entrepreneurs don't want to operate here and as sax is pointing out the you know, the the rapid kind of inflation has caused this tremendous decline
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4423.6s	4423.6	 Uh in the quality of service, there's zero accountability zero checks and balances. So san francisco is in for a really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4429.4s	4429.4	 Frank a scary reckoning and a lot of people are really worried about it and it's like a very real problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4434.3s	4434.3	 It's not like oh the city's fucked. Haha, like a two billion dollar budget shortfall
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4439.4s	4439.4	 You're either going to have to cut a lot of jobs of public employees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4443.3s	4443.3	 Or you're going to have a city that's going to go bankrupt and you know bonds are going to get defaulted on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4447.3s	4447.3	 Um, and at the same time you're going to have this mass exodus of people and businesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MV9-PH8y_E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=131&t=4451.4s	4451.4	 And it is a it is a very kind of unwinding not right now
