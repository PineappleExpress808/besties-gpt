https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=8.9s	8.9	 Very sultry filter on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=12.9s	12.9	 Having a great hair day. Yeah, that is a good hair day for great hair day my pal and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=19.4s	19.4	 Your favorite CEO and Twitter. Mr. Elon Musk. Hey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=31.0s	31.0	 Rain man David
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=43.6s	43.6	 Appreciate you are coming to the event and are coming zooming in. Yeah, what's new in your world?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=54.0s	54.0	 Well, let's see, I guess right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=57.2s	57.2	 I'm sort of debating the number of bots on Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=63.4s	63.4	 Pra on Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=66.1s	66.1	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=69.1s	69.1	 Currently I'd like the what's what I'm being told is that the there's just no way to know the number of bots
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=75.3s	75.3	 It's like as unknowable as the human soul basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=78.4s	78.4	 I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=90.6s	90.6	 Said like why don't try calling people but I haven't got a response, you know, like if you tried calling people or something, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=95.9s	95.9	 I've maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=98.4s	98.4	 It's not about no, no, I don't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=100.8s	100.8	 But I think like that would be one of the things to do to say like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=103.8s	103.8	 Have you tried calling them as opposed to the trying to read the tea leaves here? That's like impossible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=108.4s	108.4	 You know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=109.3s	109.3	 Obviously you can have an account that looks exactly like a human account or is being operated where one person is operating a thousand accounts or something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=117.8s	117.8	 But that person can only buy one toaster. They're gonna buy a thousand toasters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=121.3s	121.3	 So you care about like number of unique real people that are on the system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=125.7s	125.7	 It's extremely fundamental and anyone who uses Twitter is well aware that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=129.6s	129.6	 the their comment the comment threads are a full of spam scam and and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=135.9s	135.9	 Just a lot of you know, fake accounts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=137.8s	137.8	 So it seems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=141.7s	141.7	 Beyond beyond reasonable for Twitter to claim that the number of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=149.0s	149.0	 Essentially the number of real set another way the number of real unique humans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=153.6s	153.6	 That you see making comments on a daily base on Twitter is above 95%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=159.1s	159.1	 That is what they're claiming. Does anyone have that experience?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=167.8s	167.8	 I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=176.8s	176.8	 There's a bridge I'd like to sell you, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=184.2s	184.2	 You can buy the Brooklyn Bridge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=188.1s	188.1	 What do you think it is what yeah, what's interesting I mean, it's not five percent what is it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=194.2s	194.2	 I think it's a number that is probably at least four or five times that number but I'd say at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=201.4s	201.4	 if you did sort of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=203.9s	203.9	 the lowest estimate would be probably 20%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=208.2s	208.2	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=210.7s	210.7	 And this and this is a bunch of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=213.7s	213.7	 quite smart outside firms have done analysis of Twitter and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=217.9s	217.9	 Looked at the the sort of daily daily users and their conclusion is also about is about 20%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=223.6s	223.6	 But that's a lower bound. It's not an upper bound
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=227.3s	227.3	 If you look at say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=229.5s	229.5	 the most liked tweets on Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=233.6s	233.6	 So I have the honor of having the most liked tweet of any living human
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=244.0s	244.0	 This is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=246.4s	246.4	 Thank you everyone for liking my tweet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=250.8s	250.8	 Including you both some of the bots out there but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=256.0s	256.0	 That tweet is less than five million likes it's like four point seven or something like that and that that that was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=263.2s	263.2	 Where I tweeted about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=265.5s	265.5	 That next time buying coca-cola to put the cocaine back in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=269.1s	269.1	 It's clearly something that the public really wants and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=274.0s	274.0	 You know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=276.0s	276.0	 Coca-cola corporations should really think about going back to their roots
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=281.2s	281.2	 Coca-cola, I mean this this I guess is the reason why our grandparents could sort of walk 20 miles in the snow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=290.4s	290.4	 Okay, this is a real reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=292.4s	292.4	 They had coca-cola with cocaine this is a real reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=300.3s	300.3	 Anyway, that's that's that's literally the most popular tweet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=304.7s	304.7	 of any of any living human and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=308.0s	308.0	 But Twitter says that the daily money day the sort of monetizable daily active users is two hundred and seventeen million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=315.7s	315.7	 So why would it be that the most popular tweet ever basically is only?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=322.5s	322.5	 You know two two and a half percent of the entire user base
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=327.6s	327.6	 this this seems a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=329.9s	329.9	 very very low number and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=333.8s	333.8	 And the most popular tweets generally are clustered around that sort of four million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=339.1s	339.1	 like level so it's a sort of color like basically two percent or less than two percent of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=345.4s	345.4	 Daily active users and and technically monetizable daily active users is how Twitter refers to it. So it just seems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=351.6s	351.6	 How is this possible?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=353.7s	353.7	 Surely there's something that maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=356.0s	356.0	 You know ten percent of people would like not merely two percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=360.1s	360.1	 Well, actually, you know if you think about it Elon, there's a corollary on YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=365.1s	365.1	 What do what's the total user base of YouTube and what have the most popular videos gotten there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=370.3s	370.3	 Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=370.8s	370.8	 And I think there's a billion or two maybe a billion people using YouTube and those the most popular videos have tens of billions of views
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=378.7s	378.7	 Yes might be instructive exactly that ratio makes a lot more sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=384.7s	384.7	 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=386.4s	386.4	 Something doesn't add up here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=388.6s	388.6	 And my concern is is not that is it like, you know, is it five or seven or eight percent?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=394.8s	394.8	 But is it potentially eighty percent or ninety percent? But yeah, you know, is it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=402.1s	402.1	 I mean, I certainly know there's some real people on Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=406.0s	406.0	 But what's if it is it an order of magnitude is it is it fifty percent instead of five and that's obviously an incredibly material number
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=414.9s	414.9	 especially since Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=416.7s	416.7	 relies primarily on brand advertising as opposed to specific click through advertising where you make a purchase if you if you make a purchase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=424.6s	424.6	 It doesn't really matter that much but for brand advertising which is really just awareness advertising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=429.1s	429.1	 It matters if real humans are seeing that or not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=432.6s	432.6	 Yeah, and and so I guess stepping back for a second people are curious why you want to buy Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=440.2s	440.2	 Why is this so important to you? And then I guess what are the chances you think the deal gets done at this point?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=446.6s	446.6	 So a two-parter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=449.2s	449.2	 Why is it so important to me some of this I've articulated before but I think there's a need for a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=455.5s	455.5	 A
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=456.7s	456.7	 Public town square digital towns where that where people can debate issues of all kinds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=464.4s	464.4	 Including the most substantive issues and in order for that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=468.1s	468.1	 For that to be the case
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=469.3s	469.3	 You have to have something that is as broadly inclusive as possible that has as much of the people on the platform as possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=476.4s	476.4	 Where it's it feels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=479.8s	479.8	 Balanced from a political standpoint. It's not biased one way or the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=484.2s	484.2	 And where the system is transparent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=487.1s	487.1	 This is why I think it's important to put the algorithm on on github and actually allow the public to see it and critique it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=493.4s	493.4	 And improve it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=494.6s	494.6	 And if there are any manual changes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=497.8s	497.8	 sort of shadow banning as it's called or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=501.6s	501.6	 Increasing or decreasing the prominence of a tweet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=504.5s	504.5	 That's done manually that that should be noted. So, you know what has happened and it's not just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=511.2s	511.2	 you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=512.8s	512.8	 You're just where it is right now. We don't know what the heck is going on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=516.0s	516.0	 Why is one tweet doing well? Why is enough tweet? Not is it the algorithm that someone manually to intervene?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=522.3s	522.3	 Why are some accounts banned?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=525.1s	525.1	 with no recourse apparently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=527.5s	527.5	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=529.2s	529.2	 you know the the reality is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=532.0s	532.0	 That that Twitter at this point, you know has a very far-left bias
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=536.7s	536.7	 And I would class myself as a moderate and you know need neither Republican nor nor Democrat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=542.2s	542.2	 And in fact, I have voted voted overwhelmingly for Democrats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=546.7s	546.7	 Historically overwhelmingly like I'm not sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=549.5s	549.5	 I might never have voted for a Republican just to be clear right now. Now this election I will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=560.3s	560.3	 David you okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=563.7s	563.7	 Keep going. He's fine. He's fine. We're gonna resuscitate him. We're gonna resuscitate david sacks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=567.8s	567.8	 I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=568.7s	568.7	 Let me ask you a point of turn I make is that this is not some sort of attempt to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=573.2s	573.2	 You know, it's not some right-wing takeover as as say people in life may fear but rather a moderate wing takeover
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=580.3s	580.3	 and an attempt to ensure that that people of of all, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=585.3s	585.3	 Political beliefs feel welcome on on a digital town square that and they can express
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=591.2s	591.2	 Their their beliefs without fear of being banned or shadow banned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=595.7s	595.7	 And and and that we we obviously need to get rid of the bots
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=599.0s	599.0	 and and scams and trolls and people that are operating a huge bot armies and attempt to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=605.7s	605.7	 Unduly influence the the public opinion. So this is what I think it's very important that we have that like the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=613.4s	613.4	 the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=614.4s	614.4	 some of the smartest people in history have said have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=617.2s	617.2	 Have thought about it and said like free speech is important for a for a healthy democracy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=622.9s	622.9	 It is important and free speech only matters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=632.7s	632.7	 Like say when does free speech matter most it's when someone when it's someone you don't like saying something you don't like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=639.3s	639.3	 That's when it actually matters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=641.4s	641.4	 um, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=643.4s	643.4	 um, you know can't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=645.4s	645.4	 Obviously and and and it's pretty annoying when someone you don't like says something you don't like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=650.0s	650.0	 That's that's that's bad, but it's actually a good sign of that that you have free speech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=656.7s	656.7	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=657.8s	657.8	 So, I mean I get trashed by the media all the time. It's fine. I don't care
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=662.2s	662.2	 Good do do it twice as much. I couldn't care less
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=665.6s	665.6	 But it's indicative of the fact that even though um, I you know, I have like a lot of resources
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=670.8s	670.8	 I do not actually have the ability to stop the media from trashing me and that's actually a good thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=676.2s	676.2	 Yeah, I I have to ask
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=678.5s	678.5	 With regard to this current administration, I know how hard you work, uh on the car company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=684.8s	684.8	 And then biden, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=687.2s	687.2	 You've been a lifelong democrat. You've donated to obama and to everybody probably never voted republican and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=693.8s	693.8	 yet and the same is true for joe rogan joe rogan is you know, a bernie sanders supporter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=700.1s	700.1	 And that the democratic party has been openly hostile to joe rogan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=704.3s	704.3	 And biden can't even say the word tesla or invite you to the white house when they do an evie summit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=710.4s	710.4	 I'm curious just on a very personal basis. What does it feel like to have that experience where the party you supported?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=717.2s	717.2	 Is it won't even say the name of your company or invite you there? They should be celebrating the work you're doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=723.1s	723.1	 Yeah, I mean it definitely feels like this is not right like this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=726.6s	726.6	 Um, this is uh, the the the issue here is that there's just an uh, this the the democrat party is overly overly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=734.1s	734.1	 Controlled by the unions and by the trial lawyers, particularly the class action lawyers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=739.5s	739.5	 Um, and generally if you if you'll see something that doesn't that is not in the interest of the people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=744.5s	744.5	 Um is on the on the democrat side it's going to come because of the unions, uh, which is just another form of monopoly and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=752.2s	752.2	 the trial lawyers, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=754.3s	754.3	 The that that's where actions will be happening from the democrat side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=758.1s	758.1	 They're not in the interest of the people and then um to be fair on the republican side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=763.1s	763.1	 Uh, there's there's if you say like where there's something like not not ideal happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=768.1s	768.1	 It's because of corporate evil, um and uh religious zealotry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=772.8s	772.8	 But that's generally where the bad things will be coming from on the republican side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=777.2s	777.2	 um that are not representative of the people so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=780.4s	780.4	 Um in the case of biden he is simply too too much, uh captured by the unions, um, which was not the case with obama
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=788.3s	788.3	 Um, so in the case of obama you could have you know, he was sort of quite reasonable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=793.2s	793.2	 um, and I think he took more of a view of that, you know, obviously you take the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=798.1s	798.1	 Concerns of the unions into account but uh, there are bigger issues at stake and and unfortunately biden does not do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=805.6s	805.6	 You don't have a i have a tesla question I read today it's incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=809.0s	809.0	 There was a bloomberg article that said the following so the setup is this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=812.3s	812.3	 It said since you went public tesla's up 22 000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=816.7s	816.7	 11 quarters of prof sequential profitability. So hitting on all cylinders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=821.6s	821.6	 but the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=823.0s	823.0	 public analyst
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=826.0s	826.0	 We had solicitor that's a car joke that's a combustor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=829.1s	829.1	 Uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=838.2s	838.2	 But analysts, uh when they put out their projections, okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=843.0s	843.0	 It's it's one of the most enormous bans for any company in america the the price targets for tesla despite all of this success
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=850.0s	850.0	 Some have it at 200 some have it at 1600. It's all over the place you tweeted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=854.9s	854.9	 A couple months ago tesla's not a company. It's like six companies inside of a company like you've had to build this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=862.0s	862.0	 Yeah, maybe more. Can you just explain to people?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=864.7s	864.7	 All these companies inside the super company just so folks have a sense of what had to be done to get here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=869.8s	869.8	 Okay, I mean this this question requires thought and i'll probably be leaving out quite a few things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=874.5s	874.5	 But if you look at say what what does a typical?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=878.3s	878.3	 car company do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=880.1s	880.1	 what what they do is they they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=882.1s	882.1	 They they assemble vehicles
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=886.2s	886.2	 And they send them to dealers and they manage the supply chain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=889.9s	889.9	 Uh the they they might make the engine or typically will make the engine but most of the parts are made by suppliers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=897.9s	897.9	 And a lot of the actual technology development is done by suppliers and most of this most of the vehicle software is done by suppliers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=905.1s	905.1	 so the actual amount of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=906.6s	906.6	 Real work done by car companies that what you think of sort of like a gm afford is not actually that much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=912.9s	912.9	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=913.9s	913.9	 And but like so they don't do they don't do sales. They don't do service
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=919.0s	919.0	 they uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=920.2s	920.2	 So in the case of tesla, for example, we we do we we do our own sales and service
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=925.9s	925.9	 We don't have dealerships. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=928.1s	928.1	 then uh tesla also has by far the biggest network of superchargers sort of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=933.4s	933.4	 Electric equivalent of gas stations. So we built the entire global supercharger network
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=938.2s	938.2	 Which is still the most advanced and by far the best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=941.3s	941.3	 way to charge your car when traveling long distance or if you live in a city, um and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=946.6s	946.6	 And don't have the ability to charge your car because of street parking or an apartment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=950.6s	950.6	 So the whole supercharger network we developed the supercharger network. We deployed it. I think we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=956.5s	956.5	 I don't know 15 000 superchargers globally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=958.8s	958.8	 Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=960.1s	960.1	 In travel anywhere in america right now with the tesla supercharger network
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=965.3s	965.3	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=966.6s	966.6	 then uh in terms of vertical integration, uh, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=971.4s	971.4	 We make the the battery pack, uh, the the power electronics to drive unit. Um, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=977.8s	977.8	 uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=978.9s	978.9	 We actually make we're more integrated in the parts. We actually make so much of the car internally. We're vertically integrated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=986.6s	986.6	 um, not necessarily because we just we think that there's some religious reason to be able to integrate it but because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=992.2s	992.2	 The pace of which we needed to move was just much faster than the supply chain could move
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=996.6s	996.6	 And to the degree that you inherit the legacy supply chain you inherit the legacy constraints including the speed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1003.0s	1003.0	 cost and uh and technology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1005.6s	1005.6	 And then tesla is as much a software company as it is a hardware company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1009.5s	1009.5	 So the software that runs in tesla operates the car operates the screen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1014.2s	1014.2	 Uh does the charging all of that stuff is developed by tesla
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1018.4s	1018.4	 and um, so we have sort of a car a tesla os in the car
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1022.2s	1022.2	 when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1024.5s	1024.5	 I've been gone for a long time and then very importantly, uh tesla has built uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1031.4s	1031.4	 uh an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1032.6s	1032.6	 Autopilot ai team from scratch. Uh, that is the best real world ai team on earth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1038.1s	1038.1	 And if anyone else has got a better one, i'd like to see it demonstrated in a car
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1041.5s	1041.5	 um the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1043.2s	1043.2	 the full self-driving beta at this point, uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1046.6s	1046.6	 can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1047.8s	1047.8	 Very often take you with zero interventions across the bay area from santa zeta marin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1053.8s	1053.8	 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1055.2s	1055.2	 Through complex traffic. It's really quite sophisticated. Um, and I'd invite anyone to to join the beta or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1061.5s	1061.5	 Look at the videos of those who are in the beta. We've got like 100 000 people in the beta
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1064.6s	1064.6	 So it's not tiny and we'll be expanding that to I don't probably a million people or a million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1070.2s	1070.2	 I don't know on that order by the end of the year. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1074.0s	1074.0	 um, it's um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1076.6s	1076.6	 You had this slide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1078.0s	1078.0	 We also we also built a chip team too because there wasn't there wasn't hardware that we could run the frigging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1084.0s	1084.0	 ai on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1085.4s	1085.4	 We couldn't just uh, fill the trunk with a whole bunch of gpus. Um, and and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1090.7s	1090.7	 you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1092.0s	1092.0	 They would have taken a trunk full of gpus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1095.0s	1095.0	 That would have been very expensive and take a massive amount of power and cooling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1098.7s	1098.7	 Just to be able to do what the tesla designed, uh, full-size driving computer can do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1103.6s	1103.6	 So and we started a chip team from scratch designed it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1106.4s	1106.4	 It was the best in the world and still is the best in the world several years later
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1111.5s	1111.5	 And we're also then developed we were designing a dojo supercomputer to be able to process the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1118.2s	1118.2	 All the video that's coming in from billions of miles of data because just sort of like the way that that it's ridiculous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1123.9s	1123.9	 To compete with google because they have so much data and they have all the people doing searches all the time and humanity is training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1129.3s	1129.3	 It but same is true of tesla. You really need billions of miles. Ultimately tens of billions of miles of training data combined with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1137.2s	1137.2	 sort of a vast training computer and then uh optimize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1142.1s	1142.1	 Uh inference hardware in the car
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1144.2s	1144.2	 Um, and say the art ai and training and specialized software across the board to be able to achieve a full self-driving solution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1152.0s	1152.0	 I uh, I just want that when when he opened tesla gigafactory remember this six years ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1157.5s	1157.5	 I'll just tell the audience's story quickly elon. He puts a slide up there and he says guys. We're not actually building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1163.8s	1163.8	 A factory we're building a machine that makes machines and he puts the layout of the factory and it looks like a chip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1170.5s	1170.5	 And it was basically like how you would actually lay out a microchip if you were or you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1174.5s	1174.5	 You were like a layout engineer. It was the craziest thing i'd ever seen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1177.0s	1177.0	 I was like that was when I first got it. Yeah, you know you walk in 10 and you see what's happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1180.9s	1180.9	 And you have an insurance company now you're doing insurance for tesla owners and an uber competitor, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1185.3s	1185.3	 And eventually a robo taxi uber competitor r.i.p. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1190.0s	1190.0	 Yeah, I mean insurance is like quite significant now. Are you okay? Yeah, i'm okay. Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1196.2s	1196.2	 Because the the car insurance thing is a bigger deal. That may seem a lot of people are paying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1201.0s	1201.0	 Um, you know 30 40 percent as much as their lease payment for the car in car insurance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1207.4s	1207.4	 so the car insurance industry is incredibly inefficient because they're they're just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1211.6s	1211.6	 Firstly you got like so many um sort of middle entities you've got from the insurance agent all the way to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1217.7s	1217.7	 The final sort of reinsurer there's like a half dozen companies each taking a cut
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1222.0s	1222.0	 and then uh the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1224.4s	1224.4	 It's all very statistical so that there's um, even if you're a very good driver like you could be like, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1231.0s	1231.0	 20 years old and a great driver, but they it's all statistical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1234.6s	1234.6	 So you can't get you either can't get insurance or it's extremely expensive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1239.4s	1239.4	 So but tesla allows for real-time insurance based on how you actually drive the car
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1244.7s	1244.7	 You can actually if you drive the car
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1247.2s	1247.2	 In a safer way you actually uh have lower insurance. So ours is is insurance is based on how you actually drive not how?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1256.2s	1256.2	 you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1257.4s	1257.4	 historically people that you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1260.1s	1260.1	 Your whatever demographic have drive it's and and then you can close the loop around your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1265.2s	1265.2	 insurance rate by simply driving better and looking at your score and and and lowering your insurance in real time and people do it actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1271.8s	1271.8	 Promote safer driving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1273.8s	1273.8	 I actually have had this experience because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1276.4s	1276.4	 In my household two people drive my car and one of them has a 93 score and the other one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1281.9s	1281.9	 Does not they have like a 64?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1284.9s	1284.9	 And um, you may have met this other person but uh, i've been trying to work with her on the aggressive turns and stops
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1291.8s	1291.8	 in advance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1293.5s	1293.5	 Of our insurance bill, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1296.3s	1296.3	 Which we're hoping will go down at some point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1300.1s	1300.1	 You didn't oh the one question are is this twitter deal gonna get closed you think the chances here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1305.7s	1305.7	 Well, I mean it really depends on on a lot of factors here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1310.3s	1310.3	 i'm still waiting for uh some sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1312.7s	1312.7	 A logical explanation for the number of sort of fake or spam accounts on twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1319.8s	1319.8	 And twitter is refusing to tell us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1322.5s	1322.5	 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1324.2s	1324.2	 you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1325.9s	1325.9	 This just seems like a strange thing. Um, wait, sorry is are they refusing to tell you or you don't think they really know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1331.7s	1331.7	 I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1332.6s	1332.6	 There's a good chance they may just have no idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1336.1s	1336.1	 They claim that they do know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1338.1s	1338.1	 Yeah, and they claim that they've got this complex methodology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1342.6s	1342.6	 That only they can understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1348.3s	1348.3	 But the guy who landed two rockets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1351.6s	1351.6	 Which is through you stir this cauldron and then you throw the novel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1356.2s	1356.2	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1362.3s	1362.3	 It comes to you in a dream, I don't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1366.9s	1366.9	 But there should be some uh, you know objective way to assert the uh thing because this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1372.5s	1372.5	 This is a material public state threshold issue. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1375.9s	1375.9	 It you know, it's it's a you know, it's a material adverse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1380.6s	1380.6	 misstatement, you know if if they in fact, uh have been um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1385.7s	1385.7	 Vesperously claiming less than five percent of fake or spam accounts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1389.3s	1389.3	 But in fact it is four or five times that number or perhaps ten times that number
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1393.8s	1393.8	 This is a big deal. Um, it's not this it seemed like if you said, okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1398.4s	1398.4	 Um, i'm gonna I agree to buy your house you say the house has less than five percent termites
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1404.0s	1404.0	 That's that's an acceptable number. But if it turns out it is 90 termites. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1410.2s	1410.2	 Not okay, you know, it's not the same house. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1417.4s	1417.4	 Might leave it literally your house will disappear because it's mostly made of termites
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1422.9s	1422.9	 Um, so you know that that would obviously just not be appropriate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1425.8s	1425.8	 So in making the twitter offer I was obviously relying upon the the truth and accuracy of their public filings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1431.7s	1431.7	 If those those filings are not accurate, it's simply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1435.8s	1435.8	 Not that's that it's it's not you you can't pay the same price for something that is much worse than they claimed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1443.8s	1443.8	 And you know, they say elon life's in negotiation. So at a different price, it might be a totally viable deal, correct?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1451.8s	1451.8	 I mean that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1456.8s	1456.8	 May I mean it's not out of the question. Um, but I really would you know, this is you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1462.1s	1462.1	 The more questions I ask the more I the more my concerns, uh grow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1467.6s	1467.6	 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1470.3s	1470.3	 You know at the end of the day acquiring it has to be fixable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1473.6s	1473.6	 Um and and fixable, you know with with reasonable time frame and without revenues collapsing along the way and all that sort of stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1480.6s	1480.6	 um, and so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1483.3s	1483.3	 You know, I I really need to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1485.8s	1485.8	 how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1487.0s	1487.0	 These things are being calculated and and it it can't be some deep mystery that is like more complex than the human soul or something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1493.9s	1493.9	 Like that. Um, it's gotta be you know, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1497.9s	1497.9	 I think we can apply the scientific method to this and try to figure out what's really going on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1503.6s	1503.6	 and um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1505.3s	1505.3	 Twitter's revenue is is primarily dependent. I think 70% or some that order on brand advertising as opposed to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1512.0s	1512.0	 Specific purchase advertising this is a big deal because brand advertising is not there's not a there's not a purchase that results from that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1519.4s	1519.4	 So it's basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1520.8s	1520.8	 You know how much mindshare or like basically if you're a big company, how often do they hear your name?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1527.2s	1527.2	 It's as opposed to something that where you can directly measure the outcome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1530.8s	1530.8	 Um, so that that means that they're somewhat going on faith
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1534.2s	1534.2	 And if that faith is undermined or reduced because of the reality of the situation coming to the fore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1540.4s	1540.4	 Then the the the tesla's revenue or twitter's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1544.6s	1544.6	 Satya the t
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1546.6s	1546.6	 twitter's revenue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1548.1s	1548.1	 Uh will be uh, significantly impaired and that's a major problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1553.2s	1553.2	 Elon, did you have a chance to ask these questions during your negotiation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1558.0s	1558.0	 Uh the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1559.8s	1559.8	 Like I said, I was reliant upon their public filings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1562.8s	1562.8	 so to the degree that like the public public and this is normal for a public company if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1567.8s	1567.8	 You know if you make a formal filing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1571.6s	1571.6	 That that is what investors are relying upon or relying on whether they are making an acquisition offer or simply buying some shares
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1580.2s	1580.2	 So this this this the accuracy of these filings is important whether you're buying one share or the whole company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1586.2s	1586.2	 um, and so if these filings are inaccurate if they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1591.1s	1591.1	 Sort of potentially blatant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1593.8s	1593.8	 It's a big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1595.4s	1595.4	 Deal Elon do you have a sense of why this has been such a persistent problem for twitter?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1600.7s	1600.7	 Do they not have the technical capabilities to solve the the bot problem?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1605.3s	1605.3	 or is it more of like just a they've under prioritized the issue or been unwilling to because potentially their implications for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1612.6s	1612.6	 Uh ad ad ad revenue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1615.0s	1615.0	 I I I don't know. It's sort of speculative at this point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1617.7s	1617.7	 so the you know the the uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1620.2s	1620.2	 The worst interpretation would be that they don't want to look too closely at the thing because they might not like the answer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1626.2s	1626.2	 That would be the worst interpretation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1628.6s	1628.6	 But the bet i'm not sure what the best interpretation is but the least bad interpretation would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1633.4s	1633.4	 Maybe they thought it was this way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1634.8s	1634.8	 But they're the way they were doing it was wrong and they didn't realize they were mistaken and simply weren't paying enough attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1640.2s	1640.2	 Um, it does seem as though it should be a lot easier to get rid of the bots and and spam and trolls
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1645.5s	1645.5	 Then uh, like this is not some we're not trying to put the atom here, you know, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1650.7s	1650.7	 We're not trying to get to the moon. Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1653.0s	1653.0	 just trying to uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1655.5s	1655.5	 Limit the amount of obviously scammy accounts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1659.8s	1659.8	 If it's if it's like a bitcoin giveaway, um, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1664.8s	1664.8	 Probably it's full. It's a spammer, you know, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1670.5s	1670.5	 Maybe you know, wait, you're not giving away 100 bitcoin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1674.8s	1674.8	 I just sent you 10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1678.0s	1678.0	 If you send me two bitcoin i'll send you one back, right? That's my what if I send you 20?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1685.4s	1685.4	 Actually, um, I thought one of the interesting things that came up in your product road map
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1691.1s	1691.1	 or I guess this was released and people covered it was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1696.2s	1696.2	 possibility of twitter becoming kind of a super app with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1699.9s	1699.9	 Payments included. Um, maybe perhaps even doge or something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1703.6s	1703.6	 This seems to me, uh based on your work with with david at paypal like a pretty brilliant idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1708.6s	1708.6	 What's what's the vision there in terms of if you were able to buy it, you know, perhaps at the right price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1713.9s	1713.9	 Um, what would it look like if you know, I could add jason to add elon musk, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1719.8s	1719.8	 10 bucks or something if you know, we were splitting a check or something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1724.0s	1724.0	 Sure. Well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1725.8s	1725.8	 For those that have used wechat. I think that's wechat's actually a good model. Um, if you're in china
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1731.3s	1731.3	 It's basically you kind of live on wechat. It does everything. Um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1735.0s	1735.0	 It's sort of like twitter plus paypal plus a whole bunch of other things and orolence one was actually a great interface
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1741.0s	1741.0	 And it's it's really an excellent app
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1743.8s	1743.8	 And we don't have anything like that. Um outside of china, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1748.8s	1748.8	 Uh, I think it such such an app, um would be really, uh useful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1755.0s	1755.0	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1756.2s	1756.2	 just like the utility of it of sort of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1760.3s	1760.3	 spam free thing where you could you can make comments you can post videos you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1765.0s	1765.0	 uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1766.2s	1766.2	 You know, I think it's important for content creators to have a revenue share
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1769.6s	1769.6	 Um now now this this does not need to be done on twitter. It could be done from something that's created from scratch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1775.5s	1775.5	 So it could be something new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1777.5s	1777.5	 um, so really but but I think this thing needs to exist whether it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1781.7s	1781.7	 converting twitter to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1783.7s	1783.7	 be the sort of like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1786.3s	1786.3	 Kind of all-encompassing app that that like says everything from digital town square where important ideas are debated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1793.2s	1793.2	 Uh, you know maximally trusted and inclusive and at a point at which you're you're sort of have a high trust situation then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1799.4s	1799.4	 payments, uh, whether it's crypto or fiat, uh can make a lot of sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1806.6s	1806.6	 Just we just want something that's incredibly useful and that people love using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1810.5s	1810.5	 um, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1811.9s	1811.9	 That but it's it's either convert twitter to that or start something new. Those are the two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1817.8s	1817.8	 But it does need to happen somehow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1820.2s	1820.2	 Well, it's interesting you bring that up because the price of twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1824.1s	1824.1	 Is pretty high and you've built a couple of companies and some engineers like to come work for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1829.8s	1829.8	 And you've now gone through the intellectual exercise of studying all this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1833.4s	1833.4	 Um, if you're looking at the two choices now fixing twitter given all these problems and maybe just starting your own version
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1840.5s	1840.5	 Which one are you leaning towards because it I have watched you build a couple of companies and the products have turned out pretty good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1846.9s	1846.9	 So is it easier for someone like you to just start from scratch? I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1851.0s	1851.0	 I mean, it's certainly the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1853.4s	1853.4	 My my default inclination is to start things from scratch. Uh, I mean, i'm not really I don't buy things like there's still this sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1861.3s	1861.3	 you know, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1863.4s	1863.4	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1865.0s	1865.0	 Yeah, like like spacex was started from scratch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1868.9s	1868.9	 You know in the case of tesla, uh, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1873.1s	1873.1	 It was like five people still this guy ever hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1876.5s	1876.5	 Who's the worst guy i've ever worked with who tries to claim like soul credit essentially for creating tesla and if he's so damn great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1882.1s	1882.1	 Why don't you just go, you know create another car company when he was fired? Um, but anyway, um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1888.5s	1888.5	 So, uh, I mean, that's a pretty good story. I mean, yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1892.4s	1892.4	 I remember because he's a sad. I mean no, but I remember having this conversation with you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1897.8s	1897.8	 We were having a conversation about the roadster. I think I can tell this story. I said how's it going pal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1902.2s	1902.2	 And you said well, I got one problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1904.4s	1904.4	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1905.4s	1905.4	 It turns out the roadster parts and putting it together cost 190 000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1909.9s	1909.9	 Yeah, and I said I gave you 150 for number 16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1912.5s	1912.5	 So if you make 2000 of these you're going to lose 80 million dollars and you were like, yeah or double that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1918.4s	1918.4	 I mean they basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1920.2s	1920.2	 The parts of the car cost more than they were selling it for when you were starting to get involved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1925.8s	1925.8	 That's it was no no, I got involved well before that. Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1931.0s	1931.0	 When twitter when tesla was was nothing but a piece of paper, let me be crystal clear crystal fucking clear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1938.2s	1938.2	 Yeah, no, they didn't bring me in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1942.2s	1942.2	 Either
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1943.6s	1943.6	 Uh, I I was gonna start I was gonna start an ev company with jv strudel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1949.0s	1949.0	 And based on the the ac propulsion t0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1953.0s	1953.0	 And when I when I asked ac propulsion if it was okay to do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1956.9s	1956.9	 They said well, there's also some others who want to create an ev company but have not created one yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1962.5s	1962.5	 Yes, would you like to join forces with them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1964.9s	1964.9	 And I said, okay, well we'll do that that was a huge mistake jv and I should have just started the car company ourselves instead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1971.8s	1971.8	 We teamed up with everhard topping and right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1976.0s	1976.0	 big mistake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1977.2s	1977.2	 The the the actual moral error here was me trying to have my cake and eat it too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1981.8s	1981.8	 Which is like, I just want to work on the technology and the product and have someone else be the ceo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1987.5s	1987.5	 And and and sort of run the business operations because I just like working on technology and product and design
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1992.2s	1992.2	 and um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1993.4s	1993.4	 And and also I was like doing space x, you know at the time in a rocket ship blowing up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1997.4s	1997.4	 So it seemed like uh, okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=1999.4s	1999.4	 This is like I always wanted to an electric car company. This is how I can have my cake and eat it, too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2004.2s	2004.2	 Uh, that was a huge mistake and fundamentally a moral error
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2008.4s	2008.4	 and uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2009.9s	2009.9	 so so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2012.3s	2012.3	 In the end I had to freaking be ceo and I didn't want to be basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2015.4s	2015.4	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2017.0s	2017.0	 So but it's either that or a company's gonna die. So, uh, so we started with really just nothing and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2022.6s	2022.6	 uh the uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2024.2s	2024.2	 You know the t0 prototype from ac propulsion not not it. That's the that's the precursor to tesla
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2030.4s	2030.4	 um, yeah, they were to be one half saying clear once again, uh when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2036.5s	2036.5	 We created tesla
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2038.2s	2038.2	 When I when I joined there were no no employees. There was no intellectual property. There was no prototype. There was no nothing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2044.7s	2044.7	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2045.4s	2045.4	 To be crystal fucking clear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2053.3s	2053.3	 And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2055.3s	2055.3	 It almost bankrupted you I mean you that sent you to the cliff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2059.9s	2059.9	 of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2061.0s	2061.0	 Insolvency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2061.8s	2061.8	 I mean that was yes, we're on the ragged edge of bankruptcy so many times. It was ridiculous. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2067.0s	2067.0	 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2068.2s	2068.2	 um, I want 2008 was one of the worst years where basically the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2072.6s	2072.6	 You know gm and ford just a jam jam and chryso
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2076.8s	2076.8	 Ford almost went bankrupt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2078.9s	2078.9	 And um, you know trying to raise money for a startup electric car company in 2008 while gm was going bankrupt was uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2085.3s	2085.3	 Difficult to say the least. Um, and you know people were angry that I even asked them, uh for money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2093.1s	2093.1	 They're like fuck you and hang up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2098.9s	2098.9	 So the only way that that that tesla actually made it through 2008 was a subset of the existing investors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2106.4s	2106.4	 Um, which includes like people like antonio gracious and uh, you know, um, steve jovetson and a few other key people ira erin price

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2139.0s	2139.0	 And and but there was the that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2142.2s	2142.2	 uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2143.4s	2143.4	 The subset of the best is what said, okay if I put in they're putting as much as I put in so I put in everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2148.4s	2148.4	 Um, and and then we closed that round 6 pm

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2283.5s	2283.5	 And there's there are some crisis issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2286.1s	2286.1	 um, and you know, like sort of you know, knock on wood like we're not like, uh,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2312.4s	2312.4	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2313.9s	2313.9	 so like right, you know both spacex and tesla have

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2321.3s	2321.3	 You know, it's not worth staring death in the face. We could sort of see it over in the horizon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2324.6s	2324.6	 you know, so I don't want to get complacent or entitled because it um, but but but if it's not like just sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2331.0s	2331.0	 Foaming at the mouth and gnashing trying to eat your face off on a daily basis. That's that's certainly we've moved on from that point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2338.1s	2338.1	 And hopefully never never return
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2341.4s	2341.4	 But but there are a lot of issues that need to be it's just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2344.9s	2344.9	 Like the if you're a CEO of a company the chore level is high and if you don't do your chores
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2350.2s	2350.2	 Then the company goes to hell and I hate doing chores, frankly. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2354.9s	2354.9	 Uh, who do who does? Uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2357.0s	2357.0	 So that's the real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2359.2s	2359.2	 like there's a whole bunch of sort of uh, you know personnel issues and legal issues and and and things that I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2366.4s	2366.4	 I don't find enjoyable to work on but if I don't work on them the company suffers. So it's more like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2372.4s	2372.4	 Just the sheer volume of work is insane. That's the uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2376.4s	2376.4	 And then and then you know, go do something go add to it with you know, twitter or something like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2381.0s	2381.0	 Um, yeah, I mean honestly, I'm an extra processor. Yeah

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2386.3s	2386.3	 I I have a habit of biting off more than I can chew and then just sitting there with like chipmunk cheeks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2392.9s	2392.9	 Tell us uh, you know, tell us a little bit about where we are at space x like how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2397.5s	2397.5	 Um, how you fund the ability to go to mars but then also commercially still build, um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2404.6s	2404.6	 Uh a conventional space business domestically. I think this russia thing was probably really good for space x
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2410.4s	2410.4	 If you want to just tell us a little bit about that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2413.0s	2413.0	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2414.1s	2414.1	 sure, um, well the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2416.9s	2416.9	 I mean the goal of space x is to develop the technology that enables life to become multi-planetary. Um, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2423.7s	2423.7	 And make humanity a space-bearing civilization, which I think is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2427.9s	2427.9	 very exciting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2429.5s	2429.5	 inspiring thing and it's like some one of those things where you can that that I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2433.7s	2433.7	 Just makes kids like be excited about the future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2436.6s	2436.6	 And and we need things that are inspiring and exciting and make the future seem like it's going to be better than the past
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2443.0s	2443.0	 Life can't just be about solving one miserable problem after another. It's got to be like like what's what's inspiring and exciting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2448.6s	2448.6	 And I think that a future where we are space-bearing civilization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2452.1s	2452.1	 Is is one that we can all get excited about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2455.9s	2455.9	 And and we can go out there and find out what what's what's out there in the universe and what's the meaning of life?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2461.2s	2461.2	 And you know, where are the aliens and hopefully they're friendly and that kind of thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2466.8s	2466.8	 So, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2469.1s	2469.1	 You know, it's interesting I do get asked about the aliens question a lot and I've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2473.1s	2473.1	 I've not seen any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2474.5s	2474.5	 evidence of of aliens, um, and i'll be the first to you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2479.0s	2479.0	 Tweet about it or whatever if I can't if I see some I mean you'll tell us if you find them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2482.8s	2482.8	 I will tell you I I will definitely tell you if there's aliens. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2487.1s	2487.1	 and um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2489.6s	2489.6	 You know, uh, I think it would be quite helpful for you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2493.3s	2493.3	 Like like if we found aliens like probably space six would get a ton more revenue because people are like, oh man aliens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2499.5s	2499.5	 We've got to upgrade our space technology pronto. What if we're unfriendly, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2504.6s	2504.6	 um, it's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2506.2s	2506.2	 you know, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2509.0s	2509.0	 Is the idea that you build?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2511.8s	2511.8	 Basically the ability to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2514.5s	2514.5	 orbital cargo take all those profits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2517.9s	2517.9	 Launch starlink take all those profits and move it all into building something that can get to mars. Is that the kind of rough?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2526.5s	2526.5	 Plan pretty much it's if it feels like a three step a three slide powerpoint. It would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2532.5s	2532.5	 pretty much as you describe which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2534.9s	2534.9	 Um develop rockets that are that are capable of taking satellites to orbit and crew to the space station
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2543.1s	2543.1	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2544.5s	2544.5	 You know basically servicing government commercial space launch needs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2548.4s	2548.4	 and then uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2551.3s	2551.3	 Build a global communication system in space
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2554.3s	2554.3	 Uh that obviously it does a lot of good for earth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2557.0s	2557.0	 But by providing internet connectivity internet connectivity to the least served because a satellite system is really great for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2564.3s	2564.3	 remote locations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2565.8s	2565.8	 Um, and you know countryside or or remote islands or or places where someone's trying to cut off their internet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2573.1s	2573.1	 uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2575.5s	2575.5	 As a prelude to a war we take down the system like in star wars. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2581.1s	2581.1	 Yeah, so it's like, you know, so it can be pretty pretty helpful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2584.7s	2584.7	 Like I think like a song like basically I think is a a sort of forceful good in its own right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2589.8s	2589.8	 um by providing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2591.9s	2591.9	 Connectivity to the the the least served or where they've got either no connection or a very expensive or poor connection
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2598.9s	2598.9	 uh, you know, um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2600.7s	2600.7	 The like we're like we're connecting a lot of schools remote schools in brazil right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2605.5s	2605.5	 I'm actually going to be headed there to sort of kick things off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2609.9s	2609.9	 Um, but they've got a lot of schools that have no connectivity at all and in a modern age
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2614.3s	2614.3	 Uh, how do you learn with no connectivity? I mean you get I guess old textbooks and stuff, but it's really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2620.6s	2620.6	 Um, you're at a huge disadvantage if you um have no digital connectivity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2625.9s	2625.9	 So I think there's just a lot of good that starlink can do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2629.2s	2629.2	 In it just by by itself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2630.9s	2630.9	 but but then the the revenue generated from starlink is what can enable the uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2637.1s	2637.1	 of a permanently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2638.6s	2638.6	 Uh crude base on the moon which would be the next you know next step from apollo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2643.4s	2643.4	 Which is like let's just not go there for a few hours and and then head back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2646.5s	2646.5	 Let's have a permanent the occupied science station on the moon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2651.5s	2651.5	 And we could also build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2653.5s	2653.5	 some pretty epic telescopes, uh on the moon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2657.2s	2657.2	 That would enable us to learn more about the nature of the universe and figure out what's going on and maybe detect those aliens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2663.3s	2663.3	 um, do you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2664.8s	2664.8	 Do you um, do you think that there's enough profit in those businesses to fund all this or do you need?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2670.5s	2670.5	 wall street and other investors to come share the load with you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2674.4s	2674.4	 Is kind of going to mars a partnership with the government does it need to partner with governments to get there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2681.3s	2681.3	 Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2682.3s	2682.3	 Well, I think technically it does not need to partner with governments. Um, but of course, uh, government support would be helpful. Um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2690.2s	2690.2	 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2691.5s	2691.5	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2692.7s	2692.7	 I mean, it's going to be very expensive to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2695.3s	2695.3	 Build a self-sustaining city on mars like in order for us to become multi-planetary in a way that's meaningful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2700.7s	2700.7	 um the the key threshold is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2703.9s	2703.9	 Um at which point does the city become
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2706.8s	2706.8	 Self-sustaining such that if the ships from earth stopped coming for any reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2712.0s	2712.0	 And it could be any reason could be world war three or it could be just, you know civilization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2716.8s	2716.8	 subsided and um and and and just gradually got decrepit or something but but if the ships stop coming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2723.9s	2723.9	 If the resupply ships from earth stop coming to mars for any reason does the city still survive?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2730.2s	2730.2	 And that's like really a large base of resources that are that that are needed, uh on mars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2735.9s	2735.9	 You can't be missing any one critical ingredient
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2738.7s	2738.7	 Uh, so and you think of this like there are these various great filters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2743.1s	2743.1	 Um, you know that that perhaps stop civilizations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2746.0s	2746.0	 Um, and one of the great filters is will we become a multi-planet species or not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2751.3s	2751.3	 Will humanity be one of those?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2753.8s	2753.8	 Species that passes the great filter of going beyond one planet and being a multi-planet species
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2759.1s	2759.1	 And this is certainly something we will have to do at some point because the sun is expanding and will eventually boil the oceans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2765.9s	2765.9	 And destroy all life on earth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2767.2s	2767.2	 So if you care about life on earth, you should really care about life becoming multi-planetary and ultimately multistellar because otherwise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2773.9s	2773.9	 You're basically saying you're signing the sort of death warrant for all life as we know it. It's it's inevitable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2781.0s	2781.0	 Um, and then there's also the various things that kill if the you know, the dinosaurs and and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2786.3s	2786.3	 I mean if you look at the fossil record, there have been five major extinctions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2790.1s	2790.1	 Uh that are sort of on the order of 89 80 to 90 percent of all creatures on earth dying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2794.3s	2794.3	 um for a wide range of reasons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2797.0s	2797.0	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2797.9s	2797.9	 but uh, and then humans can also you know, we there's the world war three danger, um that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2803.8s	2803.8	 Were that that other creatures didn't have where we could do ourselves in?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2807.8s	2807.8	 Um by sort of misusing advanced technology and and sort of just you know having some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2813.6s	2813.6	 radioactive hellhole that's all that's left after world war three. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2817.7s	2817.7	 um, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2819.1s	2819.1	 You could even characterize it potentially as which will come first world war three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2824.9s	2824.9	 or uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2826.1s	2826.1	 life becoming multi-planetary on mars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2828.5s	2828.5	 um, and this is yeah, sorry I was going to shift but um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2833.0s	2833.0	 You know when you think about the importance of going to mars versus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2836.5s	2836.5	 solving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2837.5s	2837.5	 Critical energy and climate change problems here on earth obviously the effort with tesla is related to sustainable energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2843.9s	2843.9	 And I think going back to like probably the 1950s there were engineering designs around plasma
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2848.8s	2848.8	 Fusion or fusion based systems that have evolved to these plasma systems to these tokamak systems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2853.5s	2853.5	 And every year every decade it's like hey next decade. We're going to have it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2857.3s	2857.3	 What's your point of view?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2859.3s	2859.3	 On where plasma fusion systems are are we going to have fusion?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2864.0s	2864.0	 energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2865.2s	2865.2	 This century this decade and does it create limitless energy where the electricity production goes up by 10 000 fold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2872.9s	2872.9	 And the price of electricity drops by 10 000 fold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2875.9s	2875.9	 And then what does that world on earth look like if that happens?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2879.2s	2879.2	 So I guess question is like is that technology real when does it happen and what happens to the world here when and if that happens?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2886.5s	2886.5	 I'll answer that question, but then i'll i'll let me sort of point out what the what the actual issue is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2891.8s	2891.8	 if question is like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2893.3s	2893.3	 Is it possible to solve fusion energy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2897.1s	2897.1	 100 yes, definitely definitely definitely definitely for sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2902.0s	2902.0	 so the the and and really just using a tokamak style, which is like it basically a donut ring with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2909.4s	2909.4	 With electromagnets that control the the plasma
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2913.9s	2913.9	 The the way to solve that is simply scale up the tokamak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2916.7s	2916.7	 Fusion is very much a scale
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2920.3s	2920.3	 Based thing you want to minimize your surface to volume ratio
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2923.0s	2923.0	 So as you scale up up a tokamak you reduce your surface volume ratio
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2927.9s	2927.9	 Which means like the the the volume you have relative to the the surface
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2932.7s	2932.7	 Uh, you you now have much more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2935.9s	2935.9	 Like you you can basically have a hot zone in the center. That's relatively far away from the walls and and more of a hot zone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2942.4s	2942.4	 um, so the the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2945.2s	2945.2	 So it's not in my mind a question as to whether fusion can work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2949.6s	2949.6	 But there is a question as to whether it is economically viable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2953.3s	2953.3	 um, and and whether it is competitive with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2956.2s	2956.2	 uh with with alternatives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2957.9s	2957.9	 I think the the economic viability of fusion is a much bigger question and I I think the answer probably is that a fusion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2966.7s	2966.7	 uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2967.9s	2967.9	 Fusion is not competitive economically. I think that is that is uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2972.3s	2972.3	 I would say it's probably not competitive economically by an order of magnitude
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2975.9s	2975.9	 What does it break? Is it a materials breakdown or what does it break down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2980.6s	2980.6	 economically well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2982.3s	2982.3	 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2983.1s	2983.1	 so you can't just um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2986.2s	2986.2	 Use uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2987.8s	2987.8	 Normal hydrogen, you know, you need to use like deuterium and tritium like unusual forms of hydrogen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2994.6s	2994.6	 helium three, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=2996.7s	2996.7	 uh, you know that there um, there are some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3000.4s	3000.4	 Some other types of fusion that could be used
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3004.3s	3004.3	 but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3005.4s	3005.4	 Um, these are just not they're not like there's not a lot of this raw material. It's quite difficult to get the raw materials
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3011.5s	3011.5	 So first you have to get the raw material
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3013.2s	3013.2	 Uh, that's that's expensive raw material
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3016.4s	3016.4	 um, and then um, it's not just about generating the the energy you've got to um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3022.8s	3022.8	 Turn that energy into usable electricity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3025.8s	3025.8	 You can't just have a hot thing. Okay, so the hot thing has to translate to usable electricity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3032.7s	3032.7	 So I think you've got you've got a cost of a fuel issue which is very significant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3037.3s	3037.3	 uh, you've got you got a whole bunch of knockdowns from uh, when you generate the heat to uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3042.7s	3042.7	 When you actually convert that into electricity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3045.5s	3045.5	 um, you've got some very difficult maintenance issues with with a fusion reactor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3051.8s	3051.8	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3053.6s	3053.6	 so, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3055.6s	3055.6	 And that should be then compared to alternatives, uh, the the sustainable energy alternatives that I think are overwhelmingly more competitive are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3063.5s	3063.5	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3064.8s	3064.8	 solar energy wind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3066.9s	3066.9	 geothermal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3068.1s	3068.1	 hydro
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3069.3s	3069.3	 Some title and energy but it's really primarily solar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3073.9s	3073.9	 and and wind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3076.7s	3076.7	 Now and you can really say like what why bother creating?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3080.8s	3080.8	 A fusion on earth when we have a gigantic fusion reactor in the sky that just works with zero maintenance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3088.0s	3088.0	 And it shows up every day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3090.0s	3090.0	 That's pretty consistent. Yeah, but can we scale to a thousand x or a hundred x our electricity production here using solar?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3097.4s	3097.4	 and other renewable sources
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3099.4s	3099.4	 yes, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3101.0s	3101.0	 the the amount of uh, surfshare you need to uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3104.5s	3104.5	 Power the united states is remarkably tiny. Um, so you need like basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3109.9s	3109.9	 Roughly a hundred miles by a hundred miles of territory and it's obviously in one place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3115.3s	3115.3	 In the united states to power the united states. It's like a little corner of texas or utah the entire country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3122.4s	3122.4	 um, and and then if you if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3125.0s	3125.0	 You could you could basically power. Uh, you you probably 10x the the just with solar alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3131.2s	3131.2	 um without displacing, uh anyone's home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3134.7s	3134.7	 Uh power and economy ten times the size of the united states in the united states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3139.0s	3139.0	 on land when energy prices if you extend that to water
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3143.9s	3143.9	 Because earth is 70 water. Yeah, I mean you could you could say okay now we could probably have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3150.1s	3150.1	 A civilization that is a hundred times as energy intensive as we currently have it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3154.4s	3154.4	 So what does that look like was the last part of my question?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3156.8s	3156.8	 Which is a world where energy costs are say let's a hundred times cheaper than they are today and we have a hundred times more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3161.4s	3161.4	 energy production capacity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3163.2s	3163.2	 What what changes about civilization? What do we do differently? And what do we see?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3167.8s	3167.8	 Change most kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3169.9s	3169.9	 Dramatically. Well currently we're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3173.3s	3173.3	 Because of of just generally, uh low birth rates almost worldwide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3178.1s	3178.1	 Uh civilization is not headed to have a population
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3183.1s	3183.1	 That is the order of magnitude greater than where we're currently headed towards a population decline
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3189.2s	3189.2	 Uh, and this is almost everywhere in the world in the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3193.2s	3193.2	 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3196.2s	3196.2	 You know, it basically seems as as though as soon as you have like urbanization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3200.1s	3200.1	 Um and and and education beyond a certain level and income beyond a certain level birth rates plummet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3205.7s	3205.7	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3206.7s	3206.7	 And so as countries get get wealthier their birth rates plummet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3209.7s	3209.7	 It's it's somewhat counterintuitive because people will say like well, it's too expensive to have a baby. Nope
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3214.3s	3214.3	 The the wealthier they are are the fewer kids you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3217.5s	3217.5	 um, the more educated you are the fewer kids you have so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3221.2s	3221.2	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3222.4s	3222.4	 It's it's it's it's the inverse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3224.9s	3224.9	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3226.0s	3226.0	 So so i'm not sure who to use all that energy, um, unless there's a significant change in the birth rate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3232.5s	3232.5	 Or we have a very robot oriented economy. So that's also possible. So if we've got a lot of um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3239.7s	3239.7	 you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3240.6s	3240.6	 four-wheeled robots in form of cars and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3243.6s	3243.6	 androids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3245.0s	3245.0	 Humanoid robots then you can certainly see that there'd be perhaps a need for an order of magnitude more energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3252.4s	3252.4	 But it's not coming from the humans unless something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3256.1s	3256.1	 Major changes on the on the human uh birth rate uh level
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3259.7s	3259.7	 This by the way is I think the biggest single threat to civilization. Uh right now is the why do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3265.8s	3265.8	 Societally people just make those decisions when they become more affluent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3268.8s	3268.8	 Is it that they just become more selfish or there's more things for them to do and they have more money to spend on themselves?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3274.4s	3274.4	 And they say you know what?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3290.1s	3290.1	 I think like having fewer kids is is like better for the environment. Yeah, that's crazy total nonsense nonsense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3296.5s	3296.5	 The environment is going to be fine. They're going to be fine. Even if we if we doubled the size of the humans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3301.4s	3301.4	 Um, this is and I know a lot about environmental stuff. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3305.0s	3305.0	 you know, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3307.7s	3307.7	 You the we can't have civilization just dwindle into nothing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3313.2s	3313.2	 And you know japan's leading indicator here like the japan's population declined by 600 000 people last year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3319.9s	3319.9	 That lowest birth rate in history
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3322.0s	3322.0	 Uh, it's you know, it's pretty bad. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3325.6s	3325.6	 So I don't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3328.6s	3328.6	 I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3330.8s	3330.8	 So this one element of is is a lot of people just think that having kids is somehow bad for the environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3336.8s	3336.8	 I want to be clear. It's not it's essential for the maintain for maintaining civilization that would at least maintain our numbers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3341.8s	3341.8	 We don't necessarily need to grow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3343.9s	3343.9	 dramatically, but at least let's not uh, you know gradually dwindle away and until uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3349.9s	3349.9	 Civilization ends with us all in adult diapers and and and in a whimper like we don't want civilization to end
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3356.4s	3356.4	 In adult diapers with a whimper that would suck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3359.5s	3359.5	 Kind of suck. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3360.9s	3360.9	 bleak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3362.0s	3362.0	 Bleak and sad. Well, I mean and you and I have had this conversation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3365.2s	3365.2	 I mean in japan I had two people tell me when I was there like I think it's immoral to bring humans into the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3371.8s	3371.8	 I mean people have gotten very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3373.9s	3373.9	 Sad about the future. It's kind of crazy. It's great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3378.4s	3378.4	 life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3379.7s	3379.7	 Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3380.9s	3380.9	 No, there's there's literally i've heard many times how like how can I bring a child into this terrible world?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3385.5s	3385.5	 I'm like, have you read history because let me tell you it was way worse back then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3390.0s	3390.0	 Okay. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3391.6s	3391.6	 Now's a good time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3395.3s	3395.3	 Hey, you know listen, I I know you're super busy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3397.5s	3397.5	 But I want to ask you about the move to texas because i've been thinking about it. Uh austin california
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3402.9s	3402.9	 Uh, I don't know some senator told you to go fuck yourself and like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3406.7s	3406.7	 You know like we don't need to be here. I think there's been a couple centers about that actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3410.6s	3410.6	 Yeah, it seems to be turning into a bit of a trend. Um, but how has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3415.8s	3415.8	 building the tesla
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3418.6s	3418.6	 Gigafactory which I got to see in austin a couple weeks ago and it was one of the most inspiring things i've ever seen. I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3426.4s	3426.4	 I don't know how many months it took to build there, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3429.3s	3429.3	 how long did it take to build that dreadnought and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3433.6s	3433.6	 What would have taken to build that in california california under gavin nuism? So we built the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3441.2s	3441.2	 The giga texas, which is the biggest factory in north america. I think possibly the biggest factory in the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3446.3s	3446.3	 Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3447.5s	3447.5	 And it's three times the size of the pentagon to give you a sense of scale. Okay, this is freaking big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3452.4s	3452.4	 It's like it's weird. It's like so big. It's weird like you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3456.4s	3456.4	 I was trying to find you in it and I was trying to drive around and it took me about 45 minutes to find you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3462.7s	3462.7	 Yeah, like no you have to like call so you can't like find someone in the building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3466.0s	3466.0	 You have to call them on their cell phone and say where are you, you know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3468.8s	3468.8	 um, so uh, I mean the building is like, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3472.5s	3472.5	 Just under a mile long and we're actually going to extend it there will be like literally a mile long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3477.2s	3477.2	 and about a quarter mile wide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3479.6s	3479.6	 Uh, and it's uh 80 feet tall
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3482.3s	3482.3	 So it's just uh ridiculously big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3486.8s	3486.8	 And when you think about it like for a manufacturing situation like what what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3490.7s	3490.7	 What are the two the two things that really define manufacturing competitiveness are economies of scale and technology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3497.2s	3497.2	 And so if you've got an ace on economy like if you sort of maximize your ace level on technology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3503.3s	3503.3	 And you maximize your ace level on scale. This is obviously going to be the most competitive situation and that's why they're so freaking giant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3510.0s	3510.0	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3511.0s	3511.0	 and the the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3512.5s	3512.5	 a giga texas will go all the way from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3514.5s	3514.5	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3515.6s	3515.6	 sell raw materials like like like basically rail cars of sell raw materials coming in and then forming the the battery cell then the battery pack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3523.4s	3523.4	 building the the motor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3525.5s	3525.5	 Uh casting we're also the have introduced a major innovation which is to cast the entire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3531.0s	3531.0	 Front third and rear third of the car as a single piece
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3534.4s	3534.4	 Um, I got this idea from toys actually because I was like how do they make toys? Those are cheap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3538.1s	3538.1	 They just cast them and I was like, well, can you pull a casting machine?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3541.8s	3541.8	 That big and they're like well, no one ever has i'm like is are we breaking physics like no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3546.3s	3546.3	 Well, let's just ask them and there were six major casting machines suppliers in the world and five of them said no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3551.1s	3551.1	 And the six said maybe i'm like i'll take that as a yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3555.5s	3555.5	 Well, I mean this you wanted to do this for the model 3 but it was just too soon, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3560.0s	3560.0	 And and now it's almost there. Yeah, actually this this partly comes from the multi which is actually a fantastic car in many ways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3568.1s	3568.1	 But we were rightly criticized for an inefficient design
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3571.7s	3571.7	 with for the front and rear body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3575.0s	3575.0	 Like sandy monroe who I think is really has excellent from an engineering standpoint and and really a very fair critic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3583.3s	3583.3	 He pistol wept us for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3585.9s	3585.9	 The design of the battery he ripped it apart and piece by piece told you why you suck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3590.9s	3590.9	 And then he did the why and told you why you're awesome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3594.1s	3594.1	 He took it apart and told us exactly why he's why we sucked and he was correct
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3598.1s	3598.1	 um, and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3599.9s	3599.9	 And I was like, well, that's pretty embarrassing. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3602.8s	3602.8	 uh, no, he was complimentary of other parts of the carpet body design and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3607.1s	3607.1	 uh, and so it's like, okay, we're gonna go from like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3610.8s	3610.8	 Uh the the it's just an incredibly difficult body to make it's made out of like 120 different pieces with dissimilar metals that are joined
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3618.4s	3618.4	 And you've got galvanic corrosion challenges. It's very difficult to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3622.4s	3622.4	 To a single piece casting that's one piece. So like 120 pieces went down to like one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3627.6s	3627.6	 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3628.6s	3628.6	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3629.9s	3629.9	 It's it's a it's a huge and the the like the model wide body shop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3633.7s	3633.7	 Especially the new one where we cast both the front and rear is 60 smaller than the model 3 body shop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3639.2s	3639.2	 So it's it's you know, gigantic. It's quite there's a lot of innovations of tesla besides the stuff that is is obvious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3646.0s	3646.0	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3647.0s	3647.0	 so anyway, so yeah the but if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3649.7s	3649.7	 and and really, you know to to to refer to to gavin newsom like uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3655.7s	3655.7	 you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3656.9s	3656.9	 if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3658.7s	3658.7	 If you had a gun to gavin's head, okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3662.0s	3662.0	 And said we need to build start building this factory in california right now. He couldn't do it because there are so many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3669.1s	3669.1	 regulatory agencies, um and so many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3672.7s	3672.7	 Litigators in california that want to stop you from doing anything that even if you're the governor of the of the state you cannot get it done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3680.6s	3680.6	 um, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3682.0s	3682.0	 something's got to be done to to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3684.6s	3684.6	 To you know, because california used to be the land of opportunity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3688.8s	3688.8	 And it's a beautiful state and I love I loved living there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3691.6s	3691.6	 I still spend a lot of time in california, even though every time I go there I get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3696.0s	3696.0	 Every literally every day I go there I get the jesus tax tax bill by day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3700.5s	3700.5	 Like the sheer cost per day of me going and working in california days boggles the mind and I still do it, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3706.0s	3706.0	 um, but but the californians gone from the land of opportunity to to the land of of of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3713.2s	3713.2	 sort of taxes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3715.2s	3715.2	 overregulation and litigation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3717.9s	3717.9	 and this is not a good situation and really this has got to be like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3722.6s	3722.6	 A serious cleaning out of the pipes in california. How many months was it to get the giga austin done?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3728.6s	3728.6	 Took a year and a half two years. Yeah, 18 18 months to build something three times the size of the pentagon incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3734.2s	3734.2	 And you just basically the answer to how many months it would take in california's infinity. We would still be working on the permits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3741.8s	3741.8	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3743.5s	3743.5	 Elon this this begs a good question, which you know like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3748.2s	3748.2	 I'm not exaggerating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3752.0s	3752.0	 We have one more form for you. What's a better model? Yes, what's a better model for government?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3757.2s	3757.2	 So, you know like all governments tend to increase in complexity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3761.2s	3761.2	 dictatorship capacity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3763.1s	3763.1	 Is the dictatorship the right model?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3765.9s	3765.9	 and um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3767.2s	3767.2	 You know like like how do we solve this? Let's say you go to mars or let's say you have to fix california's california permanently broken
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3773.1s	3773.1	 Is there a way to fix it or like how do you set up a better model?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3776.0s	3776.0	 So that you don't end up having this this kind of special interest complexity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3779.9s	3779.9	 Situation that eventually kills the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3782.9s	3782.9	 Population well, I mean I think ultimately with california the people of california just have to get fed up and and demand change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3789.7s	3789.7	 That's the thing that really has to happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3792.3s	3792.3	 And and and there's got there's got to be an above zero percent chance of the of the republicans winning in california
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3798.4s	3798.4	 If if if it's if it's just the democrats every time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3802.1s	3802.1	 You've got to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3803.6s	3803.6	 Yeah, and this is this is like occasionally it the thing is that right right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3808.8s	3808.8	 uh, you've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3810.3s	3810.3	 And plus the level of level of gerrymandering, which is basically just treating the people like sheep, uh, and and it's it's terrible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3818.5s	3818.5	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3819.7s	3819.7	 That's gone on in california is outrageous. So california the dems have a supermajority
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3825.3s	3825.3	 In the house and senate in california and the governor and everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3828.5s	3828.5	 And so how responsive is any political party going to be to the people if they are guaranteed to win?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3834.7s	3834.7	 It's a one-party state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3836.9s	3836.9	 and so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3838.4s	3838.4	 I'm not saying that you know go and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3842.1s	3842.1	 Sort of elect the republicans every time but if it's never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3845.6s	3845.6	 You're you're just making california a one-party state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3847.7s	3847.7	 They will no longer be responsible responsive to the people and will only be responsive to those that funded their political campaigns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3853.5s	3853.5	 Clip elon saying that 30 seconds on tv over and over go ahead sex. Yeah, so elon shifting gears to the economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3860.2s	3860.2	 Um, you know, we saw this surprise report of negative 1.4 percent gdp growth in q1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3866.9s	3866.9	 Uh interest rates been rising that increased the cost of the consumer of getting loans things like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3872.1s	3872.1	 We've had a stock market correction really a crash in a lot of growth stocks software stocks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3877.8s	3877.8	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3878.9s	3878.9	 From where you said and the data that you see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3881.9s	3881.9	 Where do you think the economy is is headed right now? Do you think we're in a recession or is it just a risk?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3887.7s	3887.7	 How do you how do you assess our current economic situation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3890.3s	3890.3	 Well predicting economic record economics is always difficult. Um, and and once you assign probabilities to these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3896.0s	3896.0	 Um, but ironically I did last year people asked me what I think about the economy. I said well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3900.4s	3900.4	 I think we might enter a recession in approximately, uh, uh spring of 2020 of 2022
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3909.1s	3909.1	 All day nailed it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3911.3s	3911.3	 um, yeah, um, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3914.1s	3914.1	 Uh, you know now the thing is that the recessions are not necessarily a bad thing. Uh, they they you know, um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3921.7s	3921.7	 What i've now been through a few of them and what tends to happen is if you have um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3927.2s	3927.2	 A boom that goes on for too long you get misallocation of capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3931.8s	3931.8	 It starts raining money on fools. Basically, it's like any any dumb thing gets money and i'm sure you've seen a few of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3937.5s	3937.5	 um, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3939.3s	3939.3	 At at some point it gets just out of control and you just have a misallocation of of human capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3945.0s	3945.0	 Where people are doing things that are silly and not useful to their fellow human beings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3949.6s	3949.6	 Um, and and then those companies there needs to be sort of an economic enema if you will, um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3954.9s	3954.9	 Um to have everyone sort of shift uncomfortably in their seats. Um, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3960.5s	3960.5	 but but the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3963.7s	3963.7	 I'm sorry. It's just i'm visualizing it the economic enema. I mean listen, it's got alliteration. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3974.4s	3974.4	 This too shall pass
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3976.9s	3976.9	 This too shall pass eventually the economic enema does its job it clears out the pipes if you will yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3984.5s	3984.5	 And um and and and sort of the the bullshit companies, um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3989.3s	3989.3	 Uh go bankrupt and the ones that are doing useful products, uh are prosperous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3994.9s	3994.9	 and um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3995.6s	3995.6	 But there's certainly a lesson here that if one is making useful product and and and do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=3999.9s	3999.9	 Has a company that makes sense. Uh, make sure you're not running things too close to the edge from a capital standpoint
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4004.9s	4004.9	 They've got some capital reserves to uh last through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4007.9s	4007.9	 Uh irrational times because in the in the past when there's been a recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4012.3s	4012.3	 It has gone. It's amazing. It's flipped like a light switch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4015.0s	4015.0	 I mean david do remember this when from the from the paypal, you know ex-paypal days when we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4020.9s	4020.9	 Raised 100 million dollars in march of 2000. Uh, and we literally we had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4026.6s	4026.6	 The demand was so high we had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4029.2s	4029.2	 people like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4030.5s	4030.5	 Vcs like just literally without even a term sheet wiring money into our account. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4036.5s	4036.5	 We'll send the term sheet later
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4038.6s	4038.6	 They literally were like like sleuth out our our bank account number and wire money in and we're like where'd this come from?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4044.6s	4044.6	 And it's like oh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4047.0s	4047.0	 Um they so it was like there was literally firehosing money in march of 2000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4053.2s	4053.2	 And and then in april 2000 the market went into freefall and it went from money raising money was trivial to even good companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4060.3s	4060.3	 Could not raise money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4061.7s	4061.7	 Uh in a month
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4063.3s	4063.3	 Um, so it's just important to bear in mind like that, you know, paypal almost went bankrupt in in 2000. Uh, we came close
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4070.5s	4070.5	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4071.9s	4071.9	 But but thankfully we'd raised that that hundred million dollars in in march 2000, uh without which we would be uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4078.0s	4078.0	 We were in game over basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4080.8s	4080.8	 Uh, and we kind of saw it coming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4082.3s	4082.3	 So it's like we we got that the the x infinity merger done in like three weeks and raised 100 million dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4089.2s	4089.2	 Because we were like, oh how is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4091.7s	4091.7	 We see this coming to an end pretty soon and then a month later. It was like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4095.7s	4095.7	 You know a nightmare basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4098.8s	4098.8	 And and uh, anyway, so it's just important to make sure if you're a healthy company you got some capital to get through things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4104.4s	4104.4	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4105.7s	4105.7	 and and then what's your costs and uh, if you if if it is a recession which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4111.1s	4111.1	 More likely than not it is a recession not saying it is but it probably is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4116.2s	4116.2	 um, then just uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4118.9s	4118.9	 Make watch your cash flow and get to positive cash flow as soon as you can. Um, so um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4125.2s	4125.2	 Yeah, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4126.9s	4126.9	 But I think we probably are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4130.6s	4130.6	 That are in a recession and that that recession will get get worse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4134.9s	4134.9	 Um, but you know these things pass and then there will be boom times again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4139.8s	4139.8	 Um, so it'll probably be some some tough going for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4144.3s	4144.3	 I don't know a year. Maybe maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4147.0s	4147.0	 You know 12 to 18 months is usually um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4150.3s	4150.3	 The the amount of time that takes for for the a correction to to happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4155.5s	4155.5	 um

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4163.7s	4163.7	 Um, you know what started as a slowdown earlier this year?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4167.2s	4167.2	 Now seems like I mean technically I guess we need two quarters of negative growth to be in a recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4171.2s	4171.2	 But it feels like we're in one it feels like it started
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4174.2s	4174.2	 Um, you know the growth stock the software businesses that we invest in are sort of the canaries in the coal mine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4179.2s	4179.2	 And there's a lot of a lot of dead canaries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4182.3s	4182.3	 but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4189.4s	4189.4	 It's not dead it's just it's just napping it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4193.5s	4193.5	 Wake up little birdie

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4207.3s	4207.3	 It sort of reminds me of the the parrot that you know the pet shop sketch with the parrot with monty python
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4216.2s	4216.2	 Pining this parrot is pining for the fjords

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4227.5s	4227.5	 A lot of talk about american exceptionalism over the last couple years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4232.1s	4232.1	 waning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4233.2s	4233.2	 and maybe this country had seen its best days and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4237.4s	4237.4	 We see the work you're doing and other people in this great country are doing and the debates we're having about the future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4243.5s	4243.5	 And uh, yeah china's doing pretty fantastic russias on the ropes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4247.5s	4247.5	 Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4248.8s	4248.8	 But it does seem like uh, america is still producing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4253.2s	4253.2	 Some of the greatest companies, uh, the world has ever seen some of the greatest innovations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4258.4s	4258.4	 What are your thoughts on america and our future and what we need to keep this country and and this beacon of hope that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4265.9s	4265.9	 You know four of the five of us were not born here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4268.2s	4268.2	 You know two of you came from south africa and no three of you three of you came from south africa
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4272.5s	4272.5	 One of you from can i don't know what they put in from sri lanka and from sri lanka and through canada canada
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4277.0s	4277.0	 Via canada he came through canada, too. Yeah, I know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4281.1s	4281.1	 It seems like that's the that's the way canada is a gateway. It is a gateway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4285.0s	4285.0	 And how do we?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4287.3s	4287.3	 It's a well i'm hinting at the answer here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4289.2s	4289.2	 but you know, it does seem like our immigration policy is absolutely insane and uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4295.0s	4295.0	 Maybe we need to keep collecting some of the great individuals that I get to share the stage with here and yourself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4301.4s	4301.4	 We need to keep bringing great people to this country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4304.3s	4304.3	 Why can't we get that in our heads that yeah, immigration it's talent recruitment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4310.1s	4310.1	 No, absolutely. I think uh, it's incredibly important that the united states be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4315.1s	4315.1	 Like the destination for the world's best talent. I mean you can think of this like like like a pro sports team
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4320.1s	4320.1	 If you want to win the league, um, and and uh, you know, you want the best players on your team
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4326.0s	4326.0	 um now there are obviously a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4328.9s	4328.9	 Very talented people born in the united states, um, but if you can add a few aces from uh from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4334.9s	4334.9	 Uh outside the country to the team you're gonna win the league
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4338.6s	4338.6	 Um, and and and here's the thing those aces actually want to work for your team
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4343.0s	4343.0	 They don't want to compete against you. They want to they want to be on team america
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4348.1s	4348.1	 And and so it's like we have to like fight them off to not be on team america. That's the crazy thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4355.2s	4355.2	 And so it's like if you have some aces that are the difference between winning and losing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4359.3s	4359.3	 We should be like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4360.8s	4360.8	 Really recruiting them like you'd recruit like a star
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4364.7s	4364.7	 Basketball player or football player. That's what we should be doing. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4369.3s	4369.3	 active recruiting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4370.7s	4370.7	 Um, just like if you're a company that wants to succeed you actively recruit the best talent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4376.0s	4376.0	 And then and and that's the way to win and and if that stops happening america will stop winning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4382.1s	4382.1	 And we have two administrations in a row
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4385.0s	4385.0	 Biden and trump who don't want to let
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4388.1s	4388.1	 The greatest minds the most talented people into this country is absolutely insane
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4393.1s	4393.1	 Even I think that deal with this every day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4395.6s	4395.6	 Reality is like actually anyone who who's gonna who wants to to to work hard and beat and do useful things?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4402.9s	4402.9	 Um, and and this you know, uh, we we want in the united states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4406.9s	4406.9	 Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4408.1s	4408.1	 And it's not just people who are sort of intellectually strong, but it's just anyone with a strong work ethic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4414.5s	4414.5	 You know if if they're coming from mexico or if they're coming from, you know, europe or china wherever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4420.5s	4420.5	 It's just if they're like going to come here and crank hard and and contribute more than they take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4426.1s	4426.1	 Hell, yeah. I mean, that's just it's a no-brainer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4429.5s	4429.5	 we have you been have you been disappointed in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4433.2s	4433.2	 Similarities between biden and trump on this like maybe you could have expected it from trump because that was the rhetoric
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4438.9s	4438.9	 He needed to use to get elected
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4440.6s	4440.6	 But it's not as if biden has flipped the script and said okay, we're gonna go 180 degrees in the other direction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4445.4s	4445.4	 He's kind of kept it the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4447.4s	4447.4	 Which has been really surprising actually man. It's hard to tell what bite is doing if you're totally frank
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4456.0s	4456.0	 Yeah, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4458.4s	4458.4	 I feel like it's weekend at bernie's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4461.3s	4461.3	 The real president is whoever controls the teleprompter, you know, it's like it's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4467.6s	4467.6	 The path to power is the path to the teleprompter, you know, like what because that then he reads the teleprompter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4473.3s	4473.3	 So, you know, I do feel like like if somebody would accidentally lead on the lean on the teleprompter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4478.8s	4478.8	 It's going to be like anchorman. It's going to be like q q q asdf one two three, you know type of thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4484.5s	4484.5	 Um, I mean in fairness to biden he he hasn't been napping as much as he needs to but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4492.7s	4492.7	 It's hard to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4495.0s	4495.0	 Getting done, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4497.1s	4497.1	 I mean this administration just just it doesn't seem to get a lot done like and you know, um, whatever like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4504.1s	4504.1	 the trump administration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4505.7s	4505.7	 Leaving trump aside. I there were a lot of people in the administration who were effective at getting things done. So, uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4512.5s	4512.5	 But this this administration seems just just to not have like the drive to just get you done that that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4521.1s	4521.1	 That that's why it's it's that's my impression. Um, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4525.8s	4525.8	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4528.4s	4528.4	 You know, we definitely need to fix immigration policy like we had covet which was an issue and and so that was like one reason to like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4534.0s	4534.0	 Not, you know, I guess clamp down on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4536.9s	4536.9	 Now now we moved on and so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4539.0s	4539.0	 Let's let's just make sure we're getting top talent, uh in the united states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4544.0s	4544.0	 And really i'd say broadly it's anyone who who wants to work their ass off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4549.7s	4549.7	 um and and uh and contribute more than they take to the economy like that's just necessarily going to make for a stronger better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4556.8s	4556.8	 society in america
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4558.1s	4558.1	 Elon did you see uh jeff's?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4561.0s	4561.0	 Uh bezos's tweet back and forth with biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4564.9s	4564.9	 Where biden I think was talking about inflation inflation, but then he correlated that to taxing corporations and bezos said this is misinformation and disinformation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4573.0s	4573.0	 Etc, etc. What do you what do you think about that whole exchange then back and forth?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4577.0s	4577.0	 I mean the the obvious reason for inflation is that the government printed a zillion amount of more money than it had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4582.8s	4582.8	 obviously, um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4584.5s	4584.5	 so it's like the government can't just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4586.5s	4586.5	 uh, uh, you know have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4589.5s	4589.5	 Um issue checks foreign excessive revenue without there being inflation, um, you know velocity of money held constant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4596.5s	4596.5	 So unless there's something would change with velocity of money, but but it just look the if federal government rights checks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4602.6s	4602.6	 They don't they never bounce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4603.8s	4603.8	 So that is effectively creation of more of more dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4607.3s	4607.3	 And if if there are more dollars created then the increase in the goods and services output of the economy then you have inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4613.8s	4613.8	 again velocity of money held constant, um, but so uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4619.5s	4619.5	 This is this is very basic. This is not like, uh, you know, uh super complicated. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4626.4s	4626.4	 And and if if the government could just issue, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4630.2s	4630.2	 Mass amounts of money and have and deficits didn't matter then well, why don't we just make the deficit 100 times bigger?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4636.9s	4636.9	 Okay, the answer is you can't because it will basically turn the dollar into something that is worthless. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4644.0s	4644.0	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4644.9s	4644.9	 And and various countries have have tried this experiment multiple times. It's not like oh, I wonder what happens if this if if this is done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4652.5s	4652.5	 Have you seen venezuela like the the poor people of venezuela are you know have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4658.2s	4658.2	 Just run roughshod by their government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4660.4s	4660.4	 um, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4662.0s	4662.0	 So obviously you can't simply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4664.5s	4664.5	 Create money the the the true economy is very important. Like the true economy is the output of goods and services. It's not money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4671.9s	4671.9	 It's it's literally what is the output of goods and services money is simply a way to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4677.9s	4677.9	 To for us to or anything that you call money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4680.7s	4680.7	 Uh is a way for us to conveniently exchange goods and services without having to engage in barter and also to shift obligations in time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4688.8s	4688.8	 That those are the two reasons that you have money this thing called money. It's it's really a it's a database
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4694.6s	4694.6	 The money is an information system for uh for labor allocation and for exchanging goods and services and for translating in time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4703.1s	4703.1	 And the quality of that information is a function of it's like you basically you can apply information theory to money and and I think it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4711.0s	4711.0	 It helps explain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4713.0s	4713.0	 Why one money system is or why one action is better than another and so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4718.1s	4718.1	 if like the the money you you just just like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4721.4s	4721.4	 An internet connection you'd want something that's high bandwidth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4724.5s	4724.5	 Uh low latency and jitter and uh is not dropping packets. There's not having a lot of errors in the system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4730.6s	4730.6	 Um, and the same is true true of money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4733.3s	4733.3	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4734.5s	4734.5	 You want and really like you said what what did paypal really really do that helped improve?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4740.1s	4740.1	 The the the bandwidth the speed at which money could move
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4744.2s	4744.2	 Instead of of mailing checks back and forth, which amazingly that was what people did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4749.3s	4749.3	 in 2000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4751.7s	4751.7	 Uh, you you could now do real time exchange of of money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4756.5s	4756.5	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4757.3s	4757.3	 And now you could ship your goods immediately instead of mailing a check and waiting for the bank to clear the check
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4762.4s	4762.4	 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4763.5s	4763.5	 uh like and and the the ultimate thing with paypal or if it sort of was in the x.com
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4769.2s	4769.2	 sort of went more less sort of niche payments more sort of broad financial would be to simply does that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4774.2s	4774.2	 It doesn't demediate all the heterogeneous cobalt databases out there running on mainframes during batch processing and have a single real time system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4783.4s	4783.4	 that uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4785.2s	4785.2	 That was secure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4786.9s	4786.9	 and not batch processing, um, and so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4790.9s	4790.9	 It would just it would just be from an information standpoint more efficient and and eventually it would all the the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4797.3s	4797.3	 Batch processing cobalt mainframes operated by the banks would cease to exist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4801.1s	4801.1	 You've um spent more time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4803.6s	4803.6	 Uh and uh built more in china than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4806.5s	4806.5	 Almost anybody. I mean apple would be the only company I could think of that's probably got a bigger footprint, but i'm not certain of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4813.2s	4813.2	 What have you learned about china?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4815.6s	4815.6	 That you didn't know before you opened the factories there and started delivering cars there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4820.4s	4820.4	 And what should we know about china, you know as americans, how should we think about china and our relationship with it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4826.1s	4826.1	 Because we haven't spent time there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4828.4s	4828.4	 Sure. Well, I say like china first of all, it's not monolithic. It's not like uh, everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4832.8s	4832.8	 Everything is not some plot by the chinese government. Um the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4837.0s	4837.0	 the there are many uh factions within china that compete vigorously within china, um, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4846.1s	4846.1	 So um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4848.4s	4848.4	 and and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4850.0s	4850.0	 perhaps most important is that there's just a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4852.8s	4852.8	 Just a tremendous number of hard-working smart people in china who want to get ahead and get things done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4858.8s	4858.8	 And they're not complacent and they're not entitled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4861.3s	4861.3	 Um, and they're gonna they're they want to get things done and they they want to make a better life for themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4866.5s	4866.5	 um, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4867.9s	4867.9	 What we're going to see uh with with china for the first time that anyone can remember who is alive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4873.8s	4873.8	 Is an economy that is twice the size of the u.s. Possibly three times the size of the u.s. It's going to be very weird
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4880.2s	4880.2	 living in that world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4881.9s	4881.9	 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4882.9s	4882.9	 Uh, we we better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4884.6s	4884.6	 Stop the infighting in the u.s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4886.6s	4886.6	 And stop punching ourselves in the face because like there's a whole there's way too much, uh, you know of america punching itself in the damn face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4893.7s	4893.7	 Which is just dumb
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4895.2s	4895.2	 um, and and think about like hey, we gotta be competitive here and and uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4900.1s	4900.1	 There's a new kid on the block. That's gonna be two to three times our size
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4904.7s	4904.7	 We better step up our game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4907.2s	4907.2	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4908.1s	4908.1	 and uh, you know and stop infighting, um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4911.8s	4911.8	 You think it's easier to stop in fighting once we're beaten or do you think that there's a way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4916.6s	4916.6	 folks here can actually just you know get their political and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4920.0s	4920.0	 Commercial act together, but or does it not happen until we've realized we've lost or do we need a war?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4926.1s	4926.1	 I mean, we I sure hope we don't need a war. Um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4930.7s	4930.7	 Uh, but there will be certainly um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4934.5s	4934.5	 You know an economic competition that I think will will blow people away, um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4940.8s	4940.8	 And when they realize just how competitive they have to be to be competitive with companies in china, it's very difficult
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4946.9s	4946.9	 um, you know tesla is competitive tesla is competitive because we have an awesome team in china that uh, you know, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4955.4s	4955.4	 um, like do your tesla china employees work some meaningful percentage more or harder than your tesla non china employees?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4963.3s	4963.3	 Do you find like it's two different companies basically?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4966.9s	4966.9	 Well, I mean I I think tesla is somewhat it tesla is sort of pretty far out there in terms of work ethic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4974.1s	4974.1	 uh anywhere in the world so uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4977.3s	4977.3	 the tesla work ethic in the u.s. I think is substantially greater than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4982.0s	4982.0	 Any other car company or or any large manufacturing company that i'm aware of?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4986.1s	4986.1	 um, so you know tesla
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4989.4s	4989.4	 tesla does have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4991.3s	4991.3	 A strong worth work ethic in in the u.s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4996.1s	4996.1	 But but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=4997.7s	4997.7	 To be totally frank it it the work that work ethic is exceeded. Um, uh on balance by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=5005.2s	5005.2	 The tesla china team that that is I think objectively true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=5010.3s	5010.3	 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=5011.3s	5011.3	 There's not to say there aren't lots of hard-working people at tesla us there certainly are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=5015.2s	5015.2	 but if you say on average the the the work ethic in china is higher, it's just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxzrX9tNoc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=54&t=5019.7s	5019.7	 Tell us tell us like it is, you know, so what about if you're an american ceo?
