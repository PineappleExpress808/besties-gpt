https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=0.0s	0.0	 Just a couple of questions before we kick off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1.8s	1.8	 OK, look, it's what I told you before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=3.8s	3.8	 It's bad bitch o'clock. OK, it's six thirty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=6.9s	6.9	 I've been through a lot, Saks right now, but I'm still 30. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=10.4s	10.4	 Is everybody back up in the building, Saks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=12.6s	12.6	 It's been a minute. Tell me how you're healing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=15.4s	15.4	 Because I'm about to get into my feelings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=16.9s	16.9	 How you feel on Saks, how you feel right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=19.0s	19.0	 What language are you speaking right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=21.4s	21.4	 Is that what you're talking about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=23.0s	23.0	 It's called hip hop, Saks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=25.2s	25.2	 You remember when you had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=27.8s	27.8	 at your 50th?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=29.3s	29.3	 Oh, yeah. When you had beep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=31.2s	31.2	 And she sang beep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=32.9s	32.9	 And she sang beep beep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=35.0s	35.0	 And your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=37.4s	37.4	 was dancing to beep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=40.7s	40.7	 Delete that. Delete that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=43.1s	43.1	 Let's start executing the insta strike with Jake Halpern.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=45.6s	45.6	 Why insta strike?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=46.8s	46.8	 When he says something that we just insta strike,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=48.6s	48.6	 so we don't have to edit it later. Just insta strike.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=50.3s	50.3	 It's because I am taking back my power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=54.4s	54.4	 I was in therapy the other day and they told me I need to take back my power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=57.4s	57.4	 Insta strike. But he apparently reads the comments section
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=59.8s	59.8	 because he knew Friedberg that you won the episode last week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=62.9s	62.9	 Oh, big time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=63.8s	63.8	 It was I agree with. I thought you did a great job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=66.1s	66.1	 It was big Friedberg energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=67.6s	67.6	 Finally, I honestly do not like the competitive nature of the show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=71.8s	71.8	 I think it makes us all hate each other and it's not a good dynamic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=74.8s	74.8	 We should just fucking do the show with each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=77.4s	77.4	 I know. But the point is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=79.0s	79.0	 your performance after I threatened to fire off the show has gone up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=82.8s	82.8	 You know who also doesn't like the competitive nature?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=84.5s	84.5	 Jake Halpern, because he's losing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=87.2s	87.2	 Yeah, totally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=88.1s	88.1	 The fact that I'm even still here is winning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=90.8s	90.8	 I love how Jake out thinks he can threaten to fire Friedberg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=93.6s	93.6	 It's like the Janitor at Staples Center think he's going to fire LeBron
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=97.0s	97.0	 because he played poorly in a game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=98.6s	98.6	 This is a motivational technique. I got the best out of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=102.0s	102.0	 I'm like Michael Jordan. He's my Dennis Rodney.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=104.2s	104.2	 You're like the hot dog dealer. OK, pal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=106.4s	106.4	 He's like LeBron James. You're the hot dog dealer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=108.2s	108.2	 I do not insta strike these comments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=116.4s	116.4	 David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=128.1s	128.1	 All right, everybody, welcome to the All in Pod with us again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=132.2s	132.2	 David Friedberg took a break from playing his stray video cat game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=137.5s	137.5	 Sax is here in his deposition, apparently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=140.1s	140.1	 Chamath is crawling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=140.8s	140.8	 Do you guys want to see this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=142.6s	142.6	 Look at the size of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=144.7s	144.7	 J.K.L. is apparently playing no comment today on the comments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=148.6s	148.6	 So I will open the show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=150.2s	150.2	 I will open the show by asking David Sax, would you like to tell us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=153.0s	153.0	 about what you're holding in your hand?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=154.4s	154.4	 Yeah, OK, so I got this subpoena from Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=157.6s	157.6	 This is a non party subpoena for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=160.4s	160.4	 Didn't Twitter subpoena your tweets?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=162.9s	162.9	 Yes. Let me get to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=165.0s	165.0	 This is subpoena. I thought they're public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=168.0s	168.0	 They are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=170.6s	170.6	 These nitwits have Wachtel Liptun billing them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=172.9s	172.9	 probably two thousand dollars an hour to subpoena tweets that are public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=176.6s	176.6	 Brilliant, brilliant strategy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=178.7s	178.7	 But this is called a subpoena for production of business records
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=181.7s	181.7	 in an action pending outside California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=183.4s	183.4	 So I'm not a party to the laws, at least they're not suing me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=186.5s	186.5	 because I have no involvement in this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=188.3s	188.3	 But they sent me the broadest ever subpoena.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=191.6s	191.6	 It's like 30 pages of requests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=195.2s	195.2	 And now I got to hire a lawyer to go quash this thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=198.6s	198.6	 because they basically want any of my communications with any of my friends
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=202.1s	202.1	 over the last six months. It's insane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=204.0s	204.0	 Sax, can you just explain to the audience and to us like this is a court
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=208.4s	208.4	 sanctioned subpoena, the court is basically allowing the lawyers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=212.8s	212.8	 to demand that you hand over these communications, is that right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=215.8s	215.8	 Yeah, but I haven't had a chance to fight it yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=218.0s	218.0	 So now at my own expense, I got to hire a lawyer and go send them to fight it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=222.5s	222.5	 because this is a ridiculous, overbroad subpoena.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=225.3s	225.3	 And by the way, I'm not even involved in this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=227.1s	227.1	 I'm just a commenter on Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=229.7s	229.7	 I don't have any.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=231.3s	231.3	 Let me just save Wachtel Lipton a lot of time right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=234.5s	234.5	 I'm not in possession of nonpublic information about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=238.8s	238.8	 And the craziest thing is, yeah, like you mentioned,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=242.8s	242.8	 they cite my tweets as an exhibit here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=248.3s	248.3	 And they say they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=250.6s	250.6	 all documents and communications concerning your statement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=253.8s	253.8	 in a tweet dated April 16th that the quote new Twitter CEO checklist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=258.2s	258.2	 includes eliminate all bots and fire useless employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=262.2s	262.2	 50 percent question mark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=264.0s	264.0	 So obviously, they didn't like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=266.2s	266.2	 Your statement in a tweet dated April 25th.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=269.1s	269.1	 Crazy thought, what if Jack masterminded this whole thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=272.2s	272.2	 Your statement in a tweet dated July 18th that quote,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=276.0s	276.0	 randomly sampling 100 accounts a day is not a serious effort.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=280.4s	280.4	 And or your statements in any other tweet concerning the merger, blah, blah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=284.4s	284.4	 Let me just save them time right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=286.4s	286.4	 I don't have documents and communications concerning my tweets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=290.1s	290.1	 Now, I know to a lawyer at Wachtel Lipton that looking at my tweets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=295.1s	295.1	 and how brilliant they are, you may think that I have extensive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=299.3s	299.3	 documentation and source material for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=302.6s	302.6	 Let me tell you what happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=304.0s	304.0	 I went to go take a shit and I basically tweeted off the cuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=307.9s	307.9	 And that's how that tweet ended up in the public record.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=310.8s	310.8	 There are no documents and communications concerning my tweets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=314.4s	314.4	 And this idea that somehow I guess what they're trying to get at is that somehow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=318.6s	318.6	 I was tweeting on behalf of someone or at someone's behest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=322.0s	322.0	 Not true. Go look well before this year at my public tweets and blogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=328.2s	328.2	 about the topic of free speech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=330.0s	330.0	 I've been a critic of Twitter's for a long time on the issue of free speech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=334.0s	334.0	 I've written a a content moderation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=338.1s	338.1	 I've written about what I think a content moderation policy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=340.9s	340.9	 for a social network that cares about free speech should be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=343.7s	343.7	 You know, I've written all these posts on Medium going back years now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=348.0s	348.0	 You know, I was a critic of Twitter throwing Donald Trump off the platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=351.3s	351.3	 So these views that I've publicly stated are the reason I've stated them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=355.0s	355.0	 is they're just my views and there's just nothing more nefarious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=358.6s	358.6	 or something behind them other than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=361.4s	361.4	 And they're just I think they're just trying to chase a there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=364.3s	364.3	 That's there is no there there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=366.1s	366.1	 Right. So let me just say a lot of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=368.4s	368.4	 You and I can talk because our our friends have no comment on this matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=372.4s	372.4	 One question I have a follow up question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=374.3s	374.3	 During this movement that you had and you composed the tweet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=377.0s	377.0	 is there any documentation of the movement?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=379.6s	379.6	 No, but, you know, next time that I compose a tweet on the can,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=384.2s	384.2	 I will document it thoroughly and I will send the lawyers to walk to Lipton.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=388.8s	388.8	 What happens if you don't respond in 20 days?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=391.8s	391.8	 I don't know. I mean, I got to I mean, now I've hired a lawyer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=394.6s	394.6	 But by the way, just so people understand, you may think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=396.9s	396.9	 because of my position in business or something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=399.1s	399.1	 that these things happen all the time. They don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=401.2s	401.2	 I've been maybe subpoenaed like three times in my entire career.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=405.3s	405.3	 And I've never been subpoenaed in my capacity as an individual.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=408.3s	408.3	 It's always been in connection with a company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=411.0s	411.0	 And I don't think I've got one of these in over five years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=414.3s	414.3	 So this just does not happen that often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=416.5s	416.5	 These guys are totally chasing at straws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=418.9s	418.9	 And it leads me to believe they're they're wasting my time and Twitter's money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=423.4s	423.4	 And they're trying to get Twitter should just rein in their lawyers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=426.6s	426.6	 because they're I'm sure racking up a fortune in legal fees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=429.7s	429.7	 It sounds like Saks, the case is that they're trying to make that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=434.6s	434.6	 Elon used his network of friends to help wash away the deal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=438.6s	438.6	 because he didn't like the price anymore and had his friends
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=441.9s	441.9	 you know, kind of tweet about bots and other stuff to support his case
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=445.6s	445.6	 for killing the deal because he didn't like the price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=448.0s	448.0	 And they're trying to see if there's any communications that he specifically said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=451.2s	451.2	 he didn't like the price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=452.8s	452.8	 Yeah, I mean, look, they all in addition to my tweets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=455.0s	455.0	 they want all my documents and correspondence related to my appearance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=458.0s	458.0	 on Megyn Kelly, my appearance on the Wilcain podcast and, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=461.3s	461.3	 other media appearances I've done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=463.2s	463.2	 Look, you know, I had no coordination with Elon before appearing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=467.2s	467.2	 on any of those shows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=468.2s	468.2	 I just went on those shows and said what I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=470.2s	470.2	 I mean, look, it's not like I'm a guy who doesn't have hot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=473.3s	473.3	 takes every single week on various issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=476.3s	476.3	 You know, we do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=477.3s	477.3	 We've been doing this podcast for years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=479.3s	479.3	 I've been tweeting for years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=481.6s	481.6	 I'm just a commentator on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=483.4s	483.4	 I have I've never been in possession of non-public information.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=486.2s	486.2	 And I've tweeted my takes based on the public information
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=490.2s	490.2	 that's been available about this dispute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=494.0s	494.0	 Now, you know, after I appeared, for example, on Wilcain,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=497.2s	497.2	 I remember Elon tweeted in support of my appearance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=500.8s	500.8	 But there was no coordination before I appeared or after, for that matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=504.4s	504.4	 He just liked the appearance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=506.2s	506.2	 So it's just me spouting off doing what I've been doing on this pod
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=510.1s	510.1	 and tweeting for years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=511.8s	511.8	 Now, I can understand if maybe they're trying to read something into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=514.9s	514.9	 They're on a fishing expedition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=516.6s	516.6	 But I've just told you, I just think the whole thing is just such an enormous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=520.4s	520.4	 waste of time, just get into court, adjudicate the thing and move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=526.2s	526.2	 I was reading yesterday this guy who follows the Delaware courts pretty closely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=530.5s	530.5	 He had a bunch of commentary and he mimicked some of the stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=534.4s	534.4	 or the judge apparently on the case said some stuff about preserving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=539.4s	539.4	 the integrity of the court, meaning that the interpretation people are making
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=543.6s	543.6	 is that ultimately they don't want to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=545.6s	545.6	 The court is unlikely to try and force the merger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=548.7s	548.7	 because if the merger then doesn't get consummated, it damages the reputation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=552.7s	552.7	 of the court's ability to make enforcement action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=556.1s	556.1	 And therefore, it's more likely that they just impose a fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=559.2s	559.2	 But what is the enforcement action is?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=561.5s	561.5	 I don't know. We should ask somebody who's a force.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=565.4s	565.4	 No, but force you on to buy Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=567.1s	567.1	 But what does that mean? Force?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=568.9s	568.9	 I don't know about that. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=570.2s	570.2	 All I know is that this discovery request is overly broad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=573.7s	573.7	 It's a phishing expedition. It's harassment of me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=576.7s	576.7	 It's going to cost me time and money to get rid of this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=580.1s	580.1	 I didn't do anything to deserve it or prompt this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=582.7s	582.7	 I wasn't part of the transaction. I just wasn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=586.0s	586.0	 And I've never I've never and I've never said anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=588.6s	588.6	 in regards to the transaction that should lead anyone to believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=592.3s	592.3	 that I'm in possession of nonpublic information. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=595.4s	595.4	 So this is harassment is punitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=597.3s	597.3	 And the fact that they're citing my tweets in which I criticize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=600.7s	600.7	 Twitter's management, it's just petty and vindictive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=604.1s	604.1	 Yeah, I agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=605.8s	605.8	 I mean, look, you're legal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=607.2s	607.2	 I use reimbursement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=609.2s	609.2	 Probably not. Good luck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=610.5s	610.5	 No, five or six years ago, I approached Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=615.6s	615.6	 About what I would have called a friendly activist, myself and a.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=620.0s	620.0	 And another large fund.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=621.6s	621.6	 And the reality is, there's a lot of data that sits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=626.6s	626.6	 in the public domain that you can use to get a very clear view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=631.0s	631.0	 of Twitter's advantages and disadvantages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=634.2s	634.2	 And so, you know, all of these issues that Twitter is dealing with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=638.0s	638.0	 has been known for a long time to people that spent any time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=642.3s	642.3	 analyzing the stock, comparing it to other social media stocks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=646.0s	646.0	 So I just don't understand what all of this is about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=648.8s	648.8	 At the end of the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=650.8s	650.8	 A person. That had a point of view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=655.6s	655.6	 Has changed their mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=656.9s	656.9	 Get to the bottom of what that person thinks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=659.2s	659.2	 But going on these broad fishing expedition, I think is just really stupid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=663.2s	663.2	 And then what was Joe Lonsdale subpoenaed for?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=665.6s	665.6	 I mean, he just appeared for being at the All In Summit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=668.6s	668.6	 for being a guest at the All In Summit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=670.8s	670.8	 So that just shows you how silly this is, too, because Elon,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=674.9s	674.9	 we did interview the four of us interviewed Elon at the All In Summit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=679.2s	679.2	 in Miami back in was it May?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=681.4s	681.4	 Is when do we do that? Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=683.0s	683.0	 So, you know, we did interview the four of us interviewed at the All In Summit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=687.0s	687.0	 So Elon appeared, but he dialed in by Zoom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=690.9s	690.9	 It's not like he was walking around the hallways, bumping into people and talking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=694.0s	694.0	 Like there was he did not communicate with anybody else at the summit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=698.2s	698.2	 He was a guest by Zoom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=700.5s	700.5	 So if you want to know the communications that we had,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=703.5s	703.5	 just go watch that public recording of us interviewing Elon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=707.5s	707.5	 There's just again, there's no need for this fishing expedition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=711.7s	711.7	 There's no time in his life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=712.9s	712.9	 J. Cal has not spoken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=714.8s	714.8	 So I want to I want to acknowledge this moment and we can move forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=720.6s	720.6	 Sax, did you do any prep work for the interview with Elon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=724.4s	724.4	 while you were in the commode?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=727.0s	727.0	 No, there's no prep work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=728.6s	728.6	 I showed up barely. I barely showed up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=730.9s	730.9	 Barely. You guys remember.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=733.5s	733.5	 I mean, yeah. Oh, my gosh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=736.1s	736.1	 See, and you guys don't want to do all in summit 2022.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=738.8s	738.8	 Come on. 23. Come on. We're good. We're good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=741.3s	741.3	 Yeah, exactly. Why do I need another one of these?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=745.9s	745.9	 I actually want to have Friedberg stands, create an event honoring him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=749.1s	749.1	 And I'm going to appear there as the keynote speaker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=751.1s	751.1	 Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=752.0s	752.0	 Sultan of science, Khan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=753.3s	753.3	 Actually, I should really thank you, J. Cal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=756.1s	756.1	 Yeah, totally. For throwing the summit. Thanks, J. Cal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=759.5s	759.5	 First, I blame Twitter's executives. Then I blame you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=762.4s	762.4	 I think you could put listen, if we do another all in summit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=765.9s	765.9	 maybe it's profitable and legal bills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=769.4s	769.4	 Can I can I just say, like, as a user, just as a user,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=772.6s	772.6	 OK, commentary, the the bot issue is really real.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=777.0s	777.0	 Like, how many accounts are there which have like 20 or 30 followers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=782.4s	782.4	 that just spew vitriol, either positive or negative constantly?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=786.7s	786.7	 Every time you tweet anything, it makes tweeting impossible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=790.1s	790.1	 I used to be an ardent user of Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=792.8s	792.8	 And I think in the last year, it has become exceptionally unusual.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=798.0s	798.0	 Well, in fact, they should just fix it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=800.2s	800.2	 They should fix that product quality problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=803.1s	803.1	 In fairness to Sachs, he did pay ten dollars per account
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=806.2s	806.2	 to have those created and to troll your replies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=808.7s	808.7	 But it is true. If you I always screenshot it, I look at who's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=811.8s	811.8	 trolling me in replies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=813.2s	813.2	 And inevitably, it is a six month old account with that's following
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=818.3s	818.3	 100 people and has no followers or five followers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=820.9s	820.9	 And it has like some, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=823.1s	823.1	 Large, I mean, it's like the end of the name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=827.4s	827.4	 Every time you say something, every time I say something, it's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=830.4s	830.4	 every other comment is about a stock, it's about a crypto thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=833.8s	833.8	 that they want you to click on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=835.4s	835.4	 And so, you know, this last month, I've started to experiment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=838.3s	838.3	 with turning comments off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=840.1s	840.1	 And it's been the best because I can still communicate out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=843.9s	843.9	 It gets the same reach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=845.0s	845.0	 Millions of people will see what I have to say, but I don't have to deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=848.2s	848.2	 And all of the other people that follow me theoretically for useful information
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=852.0s	852.0	 don't have to deal with all of the bullshit that comes with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=854.7s	854.7	 Yeah. But you don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=856.0s	856.0	 You should try.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=856.8s	856.8	 There's a real problem on that platform that needs to get fixed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=861.0s	861.0	 Here's the thing. It's easily fixable, because if you go to LinkedIn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=865.0s	865.0	 or Facebook or Instagram, you don't see this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=868.5s	868.5	 So if the other platforms can figure it out across many different companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=872.4s	872.4	 it's not like there's some secret sauce here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=874.4s	874.4	 You just have to put up, you know, a couple of reasonable gates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=877.9s	877.9	 and have some reasonable reporting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=879.9s	879.9	 And you take a little friction out and people will not be able to create bots
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=883.6s	883.6	 on mass. Yeah, I noticed that problem, you know, in the early days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=886.6s	886.6	 of the Ukraine war, when I would tweet out my opinion, my noncon,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=891.0s	891.0	 my contrarian opinions, my non-consensus opinions on the Ukraine war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=893.9s	893.9	 You get attacked. I saw. I remember you were getting attacked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=896.0s	896.0	 It was ruthless. And those are not real people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=898.7s	898.7	 Those are not real people. Those are algorithms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=901.2s	901.2	 Yeah. When you would go click on those accounts, you would see that they were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=904.7s	904.7	 accounts created that month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=906.5s	906.5	 Zero followers, zero following.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=910.6s	910.6	 And they're brand new accounts without any history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=913.6s	913.6	 And they were all tweeting the same thing, accusing me of being Neville Chamberlain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=917.1s	917.1	 It was all just, you know, Putin talking points or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=920.2s	920.2	 So, you know, I think particularly when you speak out against the current thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=924.6s	924.6	 there's, you know, an organized effort to try and drown you out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=929.0s	929.0	 And but look, the Washington Post had a story about this, that Ukraine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=932.2s	932.2	 was really good at what they called strategic communications.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=935.0s	935.0	 Yeah. Misinformation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=936.8s	936.8	 We used to call that propaganda. But in any event, yeah, I mean, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=939.6s	939.6	 there is absolutely a problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=941.0s	941.0	 It's now a playbook.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=942.3s	942.3	 If you I don't know if you guys saw the Zack Snyder recut of Justice League.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=947.0s	947.0	 Supposedly, there were bot armies that put the pressure on Warner Brothers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=951.6s	951.6	 to release his cut of that movie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=954.7s	954.7	 And that he might have in some way been involved was the insinuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=958.4s	958.4	 And it actually drove commerce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=959.8s	959.8	 They gave him the whatever, 30, 40 million dollars to recut the film.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=963.4s	963.4	 All right. Let's talk about markets, since that's what everybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=965.8s	965.8	 really comes here for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=967.7s	967.7	 Looks like inflation is finally maybe getting a little pushback gas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=972.9s	972.9	 and oil is way down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=974.4s	974.4	 Big win for Americans and obviously the administration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=977.2s	977.2	 There clearly is an upper bound to how much people will pay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=979.7s	979.7	 for a gallon of gasoline consumption is actually going down, which is interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=984.3s	984.3	 Humans, pretty adaptable there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=986.4s	986.4	 Jobs. And we've talked about this every month as we watch it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=990.4s	990.4	 Finally dipped under 11 million, as sex predicted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=993.9s	993.9	 You know, we're going to shed three or 400,000 jobs, it seems, every month,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=997.8s	997.8	 which should take this, you know, 10, 11 million number over the next year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1002.1s	1002.1	 down to maybe five or six, which would still be an unbelievable number.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1006.0s	1006.0	 So put us up very robust full employment, which has been a big question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1010.8s	1010.8	 So there's a number of open job, the number of job wrecks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1015.2s	1015.2	 It went down by something like half a million in one month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1017.6s	1017.6	 Yeah. And it's been going down three or 400.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1019.6s	1019.6	 So it's it's kind of been pretty consistent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1022.6s	1022.6	 but there's clearly something going on here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1025.3s	1025.3	 And. The stock market, interestingly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1030.2s	1030.2	 we've started to see a little bump here, even crypto,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1033.9s	1033.9	 which the most speculative of all assets, I guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1037.6s	1037.6	 Bitcoin bounced as well, you know, hitting 22, 23 now, so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1043.9s	1043.9	 What do you think, Chamath, about markets?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1046.2s	1046.2	 We you you may have called the bottom here on the program a couple of months ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1050.8s	1050.8	 And I started J trading three weeks ago based on our discussions here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1054.9s	1054.9	 thinking we're bouncing along the bottom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1056.5s	1056.5	 Is it a head fake right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1057.9s	1057.9	 I think at the time, initially, I think I said, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1063.2s	1063.2	 it rallies to around 4000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1065.8s	1065.8	 I was a little off rally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1067.8s	1067.8	 What rallies to 4000?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1069.5s	1069.5	 The S&P. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1072.5s	1072.5	 Probably gets to 4,200, 4,300.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1076.7s	1076.7	 Look, it's always important for my perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1078.9s	1078.9	 Forty one fifty today, just so people know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1080.6s	1080.6	 Yeah, it's always important from my perspective to just take the other side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1084.1s	1084.1	 and just intellectually debate with oneself why the other side could be right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1089.3s	1089.3	 So at this point right now, what people would say is, OK,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1092.8s	1092.8	 the Fed's going to capitulate at the beginning part of 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1097.5s	1097.5	 We have a pretty clear forecast for all the rate increases that have to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1102.6s	1102.6	 Everybody's doing the work that's necessary, either raising prices,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1105.6s	1105.6	 cutting costs or doing both, letting people go, et cetera, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1109.8s	1109.8	 So maybe we're there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1112.4s	1112.4	 OK, so what's the other side of that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1114.8s	1114.8	 Well, I think, again, as I've stated before, the other side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1118.7s	1118.7	 starts with energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1121.2s	1121.2	 And the reason why I think it's important is that it really is the conflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1126.0s	1126.0	 of an economic system and a political system using an instrument.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1130.9s	1130.9	 And if you look inside of what's happening in Europe,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1134.2s	1134.2	 there's a lot of complexities here that I think need to get unpacked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1137.2s	1137.2	 So, for example, a couple of days ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1140.6s	1140.6	 the French government basically said that they're going to start producing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1143.8s	1143.8	 less nuclear energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1146.0s	1146.0	 And you'd say, well, why would they do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1148.5s	1148.5	 Well, it turns out because, you know, the temperatures are so high,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1152.7s	1152.7	 you cannot use the water to cool these nuclear reactors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1156.2s	1156.2	 because the the exiting water is then so hot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1159.7s	1159.7	 that would actually destroy the ecosystem of the lakes and rivers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1162.7s	1162.7	 that they use to feed natural freshwater in to cool the nuclear reactor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1167.3s	1167.3	 Second, because it's so hot,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1170.8s	1170.8	 all the rivers are below their natural level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1174.5s	1174.5	 Barges that carry coal and that gas are getting stuck on the Danube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1179.2s	1179.2	 The Po, which is the longest river in Italy that feeds all the fields,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1183.5s	1183.5	 actually is below the level where it can actually off, you know, offload the water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1188.1s	1188.1	 So farmers can't basically do what they need to do to produce a food supply.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1191.9s	1191.9	 So if you play all of that out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1195.3s	1195.3	 you start to see an issue where by, you know, October, November of this year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1201.8s	1201.8	 we're back into the same complexity where energy is the tip of the spear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1205.5s	1205.5	 around which everybody starts to debate all of the national security issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1209.9s	1209.9	 that we have to deal with the Ukraine war, et cetera, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1213.6s	1213.6	 So, I don't know. I mean, you know, you've made a lot of money this year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1217.6s	1217.6	 by basically doing the following, which is the exact opposite of everybody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1221.8s	1221.8	 When everybody else was freaking out, had you bought, you would have made a ton of money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1226.4s	1226.4	 Now everybody's like, it's over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1228.6s	1228.6	 And you can tell that by looking at the VIX, which is the volatility index.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1232.7s	1232.7	 We're about to get into the high teens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1235.0s	1235.0	 You have systematically it has been true that when the VIX is in the teens,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1242.1s	1242.1	 you tend to basically buy volatility, which is essentially you get short stocks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1247.1s	1247.1	 And when the VIX is in the thirties, you tend to basically sell volatility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1251.2s	1251.2	 and you buy equities because we've hit the bottom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1253.0s	1253.0	 If you've been doing that for the last year, you've made a ton of money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1255.6s	1255.6	 So there you have it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1257.2s	1257.2	 I really don't know what's going to happen from here, but I tend to think things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1260.7s	1260.7	 still have to get a lot worse to flush everything through the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1263.5s	1263.5	 And for people who don't know, the VIX is the ticker symbol that you can look up yourself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1267.6s	1267.6	 for the CBOE's volatility index, which measures the stock market's expectation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1273.0s	1273.0	 of volatility based on the S&P index's options trading.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1277.6s	1277.6	 If you look at oil sacks, we are now down to 87 bucks for a barrel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1284.8s	1284.8	 Haven't been here since gosh, looks like yeah, February, maybe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1292.1s	1292.1	 And so and gas prices plummeting something going well in this regard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1298.1s	1298.1	 What are your thoughts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1298.9s	1298.9	 Yeah, I mean, it's that particular commodity is coming down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1303.0s	1303.0	 I still think we have a big inflation problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1304.8s	1304.8	 Why do you think it's going down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1306.8s	1306.8	 I guess production stepping up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1308.4s	1308.4	 I mean, in response to higher prices, people increase production and the price comes down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1313.2s	1313.2	 No, no, no, no, no, there's less demand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1315.2s	1315.2	 The crazy sad thing about this whole thing with Biden was that OPEC came back and they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1319.9s	1319.9	 basically said we can increase 600,000 barrels a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1323.4s	1323.4	 But the only two countries that are able to do it were, I think, Kuwait and Saudi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1328.0s	1328.0	 And the total number of barrels is about 100,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1330.4s	1330.4	 So with all the bluster, all of this stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1332.2s	1332.2	 You're right, actually, it's because the interest rate increases are actually having an effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1336.9s	1336.9	 Correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1337.4s	1337.4	 These rate increases are like chemotherapy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1340.0s	1340.0	 It's on the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1342.3s	1342.3	 The gas demand is lower than the summer of 2020 in the middle of the pandemic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1347.1s	1347.1	 Yeah, you're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1348.4s	1348.4	 So the commodity prices are reflecting expectations that the economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1352.5s	1352.5	 is slowing down and maybe in a recession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1355.6s	1355.6	 So supply, supply modestly up, demand massively down equals,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1360.3s	1360.3	 hey, we want to get people to buy this commodity, it will lower the prices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1364.2s	1364.2	 Lo and behold, the same thing is happening a little bit with groceries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1367.3s	1367.3	 and we'll see what happens with travel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1369.1s	1369.1	 Homes also spectacularly falling down in price and the inventory spiking as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1375.1s	1375.1	 So what's your take here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1377.3s	1377.3	 Unpack the 75 basis point increase in the chemotherapy that you were going down that road.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1381.2s	1381.2	 Well, let me just speak to this rally in the market for a second,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1384.8s	1384.8	 because I think there was a really interesting chart that Philippe Laffont showed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1388.2s	1388.2	 at that COTU summit that we talked about on this pod a few months ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1391.7s	1391.7	 And I'll put it on the screen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1393.3s	1393.3	 I put it in the chat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1394.8s	1394.8	 What it basically shows is that during protracted bear markets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1401.1s	1401.1	 you can still get substantial bear market rallies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1404.0s	1404.0	 And so during the 2000, 2001.com crash, you had these plus 32%, plus 41%, plus 45% rallies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1416.4s	1416.4	 But even while the market as a whole was going down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1419.8s	1419.8	 and so they ended up being sort of sucker rallies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1422.0s	1422.0	 Now, I don't know if that is what's happening here, but it is a possibility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1427.9s	1427.9	 One interpretation sex of this could be people are picking the winning stocks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1432.4s	1432.4	 while the losers continue to lose and that's what's causing this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1435.8s	1435.8	 you know, jagged edge or the dead cat bouncing as they say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1440.4s	1440.4	 Which is what we're seeing in a lot of these public companies, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1442.8s	1442.8	 I don't know if you're watching, but Uber, you know, obviously,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1444.8s	1444.8	 I'm still a big shareholder, had a massive print and other companies have been doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1449.4s	1449.4	 equally as well, Apple included.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1451.1s	1451.1	 I think two things happened last week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1452.6s	1452.6	 One is there were a number of companies that reported good earnings and I think even more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1457.6s	1457.6	 importantly, has strong forecasts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1459.6s	1459.6	 So that helped.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1460.6s	1460.6	 And I think it was just there was so much pessimism and negativity that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1465.0s	1465.0	 just companies reporting decreases that weren't as bad as people were expecting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1469.7s	1469.7	 created some room to move up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1471.9s	1471.9	 But the other thing that drove the rally is that the Fed made these comments on the heels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1476.2s	1476.2	 of that 75 basis point rate increase that we were close to neutral.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1480.9s	1480.9	 And so the market seemed to get really optimistic that we wouldn't get much more in the way of rate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1488.1s	1488.1	 increases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1488.6s	1488.6	 Maybe there'd be a 50 basis point rate increase towards the end of the year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1492.8s	1492.8	 which would bring the Fed funds rate up to about the two year bond rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1497.9s	1497.9	 So the idea was we're close to neutral and markets really reacted to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1501.3s	1501.3	 The thing about that is though that I think what the what Powell and what the Fed says
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1507.1s	1507.1	 today about rates is way less important than what the inflation data will actually show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1513.6s	1513.6	 in a few months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1514.7s	1514.7	 If we still have 9% inflation three months from now, then I don't think the rate increases
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1521.4s	1521.4	 are done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1522.2s	1522.2	 So at the end of the day, I think that the data here is going to be a lot more important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1526.3s	1526.3	 than what the Fed says, because certainly the Fed has said a lot of things over the past couple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1530.7s	1530.7	 years that turned out not to be true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1532.1s	1532.1	 You would agree they seem to be doing something correct here with the 75
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1535.9s	1535.9	 BIPs, you know, and taking it a little more seriously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1539.2s	1539.2	 It's having an impact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1540.3s	1540.3	 I'll say it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1541.0s	1541.0	 I've said it now five pods in a row.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1542.9s	1542.9	 We've never seen a moment in history in American history where when CPI has printed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1549.6s	1549.6	 successively above 5% that it got under 5% without Fed funds getting to that same number.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1555.9s	1555.9	 So we should all hope that this is the exception that proves the rule.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1561.2s	1561.2	 But there's an enormous amount of data that would tell you that we have to take rates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1568.0s	1568.0	 to double what the equilibrium rate is thought to be right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1572.4s	1572.4	 There was no print in August.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1574.1s	1574.1	 They take the month of August off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1575.2s	1575.2	 They could do an emergency print.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1576.6s	1576.6	 And then they're expecting 50 or 75 BIPs in September.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1579.5s	1579.5	 If they do that, Saks, Chamath-Freebird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1581.6s	1581.6	 I think 50.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1582.4s	1582.4	 I think 50 is the expectation for September.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1584.4s	1584.4	 But look, I think it's appropriate now after all the rate increase they've done to take a pause.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1588.8s	1588.8	 They're going to get two full months now of inflation data before the September Fed meeting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1594.0s	1594.0	 I think it's appropriate to let the economy digest these rate increases and see where we're at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1599.9s	1599.9	 Let's see where the next two months inflation print is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1602.8s	1602.8	 And then that'll determine what happens next.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1604.7s	1604.7	 Freebird, based on all this, what's your outlook for the economy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1609.9s	1609.9	 I think there's more...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1612.6s	1612.6	 We all try and be predictive based on the current set of conditions in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1618.0s	1618.0	 And there are a number of conditions in the world that the switch could flip very quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1625.8s	1625.8	 And there's enough of those triggering events right now that the probability of any one or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1634.0s	1634.0	 any set of them happening in the next couple of months is probably pretty high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1638.4s	1638.4	 You know, I kind of talked about it on the show a few weeks ago that it's like a bunch of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1642.1s	1642.1	 tortoises sticking their head out of the shell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1644.8s	1644.8	 And, you know, there's a few that might pop out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1648.7s	1648.7	 There's obviously a massive problem with getting gas to Western Europe for this winter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1656.0s	1656.0	 There's an emerging problem with food insecurity in Africa, South Asia, around the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1662.3s	1662.3	 There is obviously continuing escalating conflict in Eastern Europe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1668.5s	1668.5	 This NATO situation may or may not help.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1670.7s	1670.7	 The Taiwan visit may or may not help.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1672.5s	1672.5	 Is it escalating?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1673.5s	1673.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1674.1s	1674.1	 Well, I mean, I think, you know, Sweden and whatnot joining NATO is going to be viewed as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1681.5s	1681.5	 provocatory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1683.5s	1683.5	 And, you know, it could not make things cooler and calmer over there, but make them more tense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1689.8s	1689.8	 I mean, we view it as a security issue, but it really is a conflict escalation issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1695.4s	1695.4	 And then I think that there are emerging markets problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1699.1s	1699.1	 You know, Argentina is facing 60% inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1702.7s	1702.7	 Brazil has a criminal as their president right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1705.7s	1705.7	 And he has said publicly in the last couple of days that he will not leave office if he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1710.2s	1710.2	 loses the election because the election is fraudulent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1713.0s	1713.0	 And if that happens, then you could see massive civil unrest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1715.9s	1715.9	 He's been encouraging the population of Brazil to go to the streets and fight back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1719.5s	1719.5	 And there are a number of these flashpoints.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1721.9s	1721.9	 And by the way, that's a massive, you know, food supplier, as well as a massive holding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1730.1s	1730.1	 in EM credit portfolios around the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1733.2s	1733.2	 US consumer credit is a problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1735.1s	1735.1	 You know, we just had the largest number of new credit card accounts open since 2008 in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1740.4s	1740.4	 Q2 from the New York Fed report yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1742.8s	1742.8	 All of these things I'm painting as pictures of potential flashpoints for what could quickly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1748.9s	1748.9	 become wildfires or brushfires that spread very quickly in markets and could escalate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1753.6s	1753.6	 some of the considerations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1754.7s	1754.7	 So I don't feel like I look around and say everything is good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1758.7s	1758.7	 We're in a good place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1759.7s	1759.7	 There are some indications that some of these stagflationary considerations and concerns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1764.4s	1764.4	 we may have had in the way that markets are behaving right now gives us a pause, gives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1768.1s	1768.1	 us a respite, makes us feel OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1770.1s	1770.1	 But there are also a lot of things that could go wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1773.1s	1773.1	 And any one of those things could be a triggering point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1775.9s	1775.9	 So I always think in terms of probabilities, there's a whole bunch of low probability things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1780.1s	1780.1	 But when you have enough low probability things, the probability that something in the set
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1784.8s	1784.8	 is triggered becomes high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1786.4s	1786.4	 That's where I kind of say, look, the probability of something being a flashpoint for us this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1790.6s	1790.6	 year is high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1791.8s	1791.8	 I also still think that globally, we are very primed for conflict right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1796.8s	1796.8	 And we feel like and are hoping that the Russia-Ukraine thing resolves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1800.0s	1800.0	 But there are other points of escalation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1801.8s	1801.8	 Look at what's happening with Pelosi visiting Taiwan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1804.8s	1804.8	 Everyone that's even well informed is scratching their heads saying, what the heck is going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1808.8s	1808.8	 on here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1809.6s	1809.6	 There is currently an indulgence in conflict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1812.1s	1812.1	 And I think that that indulgence will cause more harm than good, particularly for these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1817.6s	1817.6	 financial markets that we're commenting on right now in the months ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1822.2s	1822.2	 Look, like I've always said, I'm not going to be one to time markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1825.9s	1825.9	 It's like trying to time social behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1827.9s	1827.9	 Like, who's going to say some word first?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1830.0s	1830.0	 I don't know the answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1831.2s	1831.2	 In a population of people, you can kind of guess how people are going to behave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1834.4s	1834.4	 But markets are the output, the manifestation of social behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1838.3s	1838.3	 And so timing markets is very difficult.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1840.4s	1840.4	 I think you can do a good job analyzing businesses and the quality of businesses and how they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1843.9s	1843.9	 will perform over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1845.4s	1845.4	 I don't think that anyone over time will be able to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1848.3s	1848.3	 And I think that there's a lot of these things that could really shift anyone's perspective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1852.4s	1852.4	 on what you believe right now very rapidly in another direction based on any one of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1857.3s	1857.3	 things happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1858.4s	1858.4	 Jamaf, do you feel the world is, as Dr. Doom here is, you know, setting it up?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1863.6s	1863.6	 By the way, I'm not being negative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1865.2s	1865.2	 I'm just pointing out that there are a lot of things that could flip things the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1867.9s	1867.9	 way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1868.4s	1868.4	 Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1868.7s	1868.7	 I'm being slightly facetious here, but you paint a pretty stark picture of, hey, there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1872.5s	1872.5	 all these things that are happening in the world that are happening in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1875.5s	1875.5	 There's always a bunch of potential tipping points.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1877.5s	1877.5	 There's always going to be wars, sadly, and there's always going to be countries that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1881.3s	1881.3	 are dealing with dictators or insolvency, especially in frontier markets and emerging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1886.8s	1886.8	 markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1887.6s	1887.6	 Or is this chaos, you know, really acute and people should be, you know, anxious and in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1896.3s	1896.3	 a panic?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1896.8s	1896.8	 I think both of you guys are right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1898.4s	1898.4	 I think we're going to have to be very careful about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1900.9s	1900.9	 I think both of you guys are right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1902.7s	1902.7	 There's always stuff going on in markets and markets represent the collective sum of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1907.8s	1907.8	 our wishes and expectations and also the realities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1911.9s	1911.9	 This is why I think, for me at least, the way that I process this information is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1916.4s	1916.4	 trying to have an opinion on any one of those things because I find it too hard and I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1922.6s	1922.6	 have enough depth of understanding of any of those things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1925.2s	1925.2	 For me, I'd rather go back to the historical trends that we had in the past.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1928.8s	1928.8	 For me, I'd rather go back to the historical trends because those I find a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1932.5s	1932.5	 easier to parse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1934.8s	1934.8	 And whether any of those things are true and can they turn that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1941.7s	1941.7	 Can they turn that radio down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1943.0s	1943.0	 Jason, we're we're we're just talking some.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1947.1s	1947.1	 Oh, OK, no problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1948.0s	1948.0	 I just a little we can't hear you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1950.3s	1950.3	 No problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1951.1s	1951.1	 The second helicopter is replacing the first helicopter because of the first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1955.8s	1955.8	 swapping out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1956.3s	1956.3	 Yeah, no, that's a bit like switching on the helipads.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1958.8s	1958.8	 I mean, it takes a team to part this boat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1961.5s	1961.5	 I'll just be honest with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1962.5s	1962.5	 So they're they're trying to get it done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1964.1s	1964.1	 It's a little no, but listen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1967.1s	1967.1	 So the real problem is that like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1970.4s	1970.4	 If I go back to the historical artifacts, have there been issues in the past the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1975.3s	1975.3	 that, you know, for you, Burke described?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1977.8s	1977.8	 Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1979.2s	1979.2	 So this is why I think you can look at the fact that whenever there's inflation and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1982.3s	1982.3	 whenever it spiked, this is what has had to happen by the Fed is you have to take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1986.5s	1986.5	 rates above that key five percent threshold when CPI is above five percent to break enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1994.2s	1994.2	 demand so that the economies reset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1997.6s	1997.6	 And I think that's where we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=1999.1s	1999.1	 So instead of trying to figure out whether, you know, I mean, the Brazil thing as an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2002.8s	2002.8	 example that that Freeberg said is crazy, like he's basically, you know, he said publicly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2007.6s	2007.6	 in a press release.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2009.2s	2009.2	 The army is on my side and it's ready to help me, you know, keep in staying just the crazy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2014.0s	2014.0	 thing. So what are you supposed to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2015.8s	2015.8	 The fighters need to take to the streets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2018.9s	2018.9	 What are you supposed to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2019.7s	2019.7	 In my opinion, I'm like, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2021.3s	2021.3	 A version of Brazil has happened before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2024.1s	2024.1	 I don't know enough history, quite honest, to know the specifics of what happened then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2028.2s	2028.2	 and how that could translate to now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2029.4s	2029.4	 And I don't want to spend the time understanding what's going to happen in Brazil right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2032.8s	2032.8	 I'd rather just say there are 20 or 30 things that could very much complicate the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2037.3s	2037.3	 economy. I think the reality is that governments need to flush all this excess money out of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2044.9s	2044.9	 system so that we can really find out what equilibrium demand is and get back to normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2050.5s	2050.5	 There's also, by the way, a really important trench a month on like that I think is playing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2056.5s	2056.5	 out and will play out for the next decade on de globalization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2059.6s	2059.6	 So as the US tries to build its own semiconductor manufacturing capacity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2066.0s	2066.0	 as China loses key trade partners, as all of these markets stop trading with each other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2071.6s	2071.6	 and start to build redundancy, there is a massive longer range economic effect of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2077.0s	2077.0	 de globalization. Globalization enables efficient pricing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2081.1s	2081.1	 It enables labor and energy and everything to be done, you know, to go to the cheapest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2086.7s	2086.7	 source. That's the way globalization has benefited us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2089.8s	2089.8	 We've been able to get cheap energy and cheap labor in overseas markets to do work for us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2094.4s	2094.4	 And as a result, we've gotten access to cheap products. So when you de globalize,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2098.5s	2098.5	 you end up having to pay more for labor, more for energy, you have to build infrastructure,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2102.8s	2102.8	 and the price for everything goes up. We've said this on the pod for two years now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2108.0s	2108.0	 That era of cheaper, faster, better is over. And what comes with that is better national security.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2116.1s	2116.1	 But the cost of that better national security is higher prices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2119.8s	2119.8	 Higher prices, less growth. And there's nothing that we can do to avoid that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2123.5s	2123.5	 I'm not sure I agree with the less growth. I actually think that there's enough access
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2127.0s	2127.0	 slack to be absorbed by all of this free money that I think you can still have sustained growth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2132.0s	2132.0	 but it will come with higher interest rates and higher inflation and higher input costs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2137.9s	2137.9	 Everybody will have to do their part to absorb some of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2141.6s	2141.6	 But that's what's going to happen. And I think we should just deal with the medicine as quickly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2145.5s	2145.5	 as possible. This is why the people that actually think that the Fed should just be very aggressive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2149.6s	2149.6	 and get this over with quickly, I suspect on the margins are right. The problem is they don't want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2153.7s	2153.7	 to look at the historical artifact because the historical artifact would say, wait, I need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2157.1s	2157.1	 raise interest rates by another 250 basis points. That's just way too disruptive for what the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2162.1s	2162.1	 is ready to hear right now. So we're going to incrementally plot along. And I think what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2167.6s	2167.6	 Friedberg says is right, which is that there's going to be a whack-a-mole that emerges. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2171.4s	2171.4	 going to tilt the markets. Then the consumer credit thing will implode. That's going to tilt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2175.1s	2175.1	 the markets. Then Jair Bolsonaro will try to take over Brazil. That'll tilt the markets. And we'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2180.2s	2180.2	 go back to this inflationary, fragmented, deglobalized view of the world that just,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2186.9s	2186.9	 frankly, takes higher interest rates to normalize. All right. And, Sachs, I'll bring you on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2190.9s	2190.9	 I mean, counter to Friedberg's point, the counter obviously would be, hey, we will have less
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2196.8s	2196.8	 dependency on dictators like Putin, Xi Jinping, MBS, et cetera. And that would be great for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2203.2s	2203.2	 humanity. And we'd have resiliency in our supply chain. And the West, now becoming unified,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2210.8s	2210.8	 say what you will about the NATO membership and the timing of it, it's probably a great thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2215.8s	2215.8	 that the West is saying, hey, we're going to get together as a group. I think you would agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2220.7s	2220.7	 And stand against dictators invading other countries. And if everybody pays their fair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2225.4s	2225.4	 share to be part of NATO, which is an important point. That's not what they said. That's not what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2228.9s	2228.9	 it is. Well, I mean, that is not, but be intellectually honest. We all said the first part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2235.3s	2235.3	 And nobody talked about that second part. And the only person who, you know, which is Josh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2240.4s	2240.4	 Hawley, who's, you know, not exactly my favorite person in the world, but maybe Sachs wants to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2244.3s	2244.3	 comment was the only one that actually said, which is probably the fair thing, which Jason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2248.8s	2248.8	 you are saying is part of the deal. It is not part of the deal. No, no, should be part of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2251.9s	2251.9	 deal. I'm saying it should be part of the deal. And for people who missed what we said there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2255.5s	2255.5	 United States spends three and a half percent of our GDP on military other places in NATO might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2260.8s	2260.8	 be spending one or 2%. And we're trying to get them all to 2% to be a little closer to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2265.9s	2265.9	 And then this obviously trip to Taiwan, strengthening our relationship with that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2270.6s	2270.6	 country, but at what cost and why are we doing it now, all come into play here. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2275.9s	2275.9	 do you actually think that this trip to Taiwan actually strengthened our relationship with Taiwan?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2279.6s	2279.6	 Did we come out with a deal? It's a TSMC all of a sudden say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2285.3s	2285.3	 in what way? I'm curious. Well, because they are, I mean, did you not see their statements and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2290.4s	2290.4	 giving Pelosi awards and they Taiwan very much wants to strengthen their relationship with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2294.8s	2294.8	 West. That that is their goal. They want to strengthen the West. They want the protection
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2299.2s	2299.2	 of the West. So yes, it's trying to hold on. Hold on. Hold on. It does strengthen our relationship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2304.4s	2304.4	 with Taiwan. The question is, does it provoke China? And was it necessary at this point in time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2309.2s	2309.2	 in history, when the world does feel like it's a little bit of a powder keg? No, but so, so six
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2313.6s	2313.6	 months from now, when all the fruits and vegetables that have been embargoed and not sent to Taiwan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2318.0s	2318.0	 and then the sand that allows them to make chips continues to now flow,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2321.0s	2321.0	 do you think that they'll still be positive about the trip?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2324.4s	2324.4	 We'll see. I mean, let's go to Sachs. He likes to comment on these things. So.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2328.2s	2328.2	 All right. Well, I want to dismantle everything you just said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2331.0s	2331.0	 I know. That's why I set you up for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2332.6s	2332.6	 So on Pelosi, I mean, look, once it came out that Pelosi was going to Taiwan and China threatened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2339.6s	2339.6	 her and the U.S. saying you can't go, obviously we couldn't back down from that because we can't let
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2345.2s	2345.2	 China dictate which of our officials can go to Taiwan. So at that point, we had to back her play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2351.5s	2351.5	 And you saw that everybody from Fox News to 25 Republican senators got on board. OK,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2357.0s	2357.0	 but here's the issue. The real issue is, should she even have been going?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2361.5s	2361.5	 I think this trip was self-indulgent. It was reckless. She was told by the Biden administration,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2367.9s	2367.9	 don't go. This is not the right time. This is a sensitive time. The CCP's got their party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2374.4s	2374.4	 conference in the next couple of months. There was no reason to basically provoke this showdown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2379.8s	2379.8	 right now. And she just dismissed what the administration, Biden and what the Pentagon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2386.0s	2386.0	 told her to do because she wanted to make some sort of valedictory tour to Taiwan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2390.9s	2390.9	 So look, Nancy Pelosi does not deserve any credit for this trip. Did we have to defend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2397.6s	2397.6	 her once China threatened her? Yes, of course, we had to, like I said, back her play. But this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2403.6s	2403.6	 was reckless and it was self-indulgent and it didn't need to happen. And it really makes you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2409.2s	2409.2	 wonder who is calling the shots in this administration when Pelosi won't even respect the wishes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2415.0s	2415.0	 of a president in her own party. And what is she doing going over there? She's not the Secretary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2420.2s	2420.2	 of State. She's not the president. I had the same questions. Why now? Why now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2424.8s	2424.8	 Thomas Friedman had... Well, because it's all about her making this valedictory tour before...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2430.0s	2430.0	 She's going to hand over the gavel. Look, the Democrats are going to lose the House in November.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2434.8s	2434.8	 Once she passes the gavel to a new Republican Speaker of the House, I think she'll be announcing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2439.4s	2439.4	 her retirement shortly after that. So this is all part of her farewell tour. But it didn't need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2445.8s	2445.8	 happen. And the fact that she did it in violation of the wishes of a president of her own party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2452.4s	2452.4	 makes you wonder who's calling the shots over there. And it kind of reminded me, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2456.8s	2456.8	 a few weeks ago, Gavin Newsom was over at the White House when Biden was over in Europe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2462.6s	2462.6	 and everyone was speculating, what's he doing over there? Is he measuring the drapes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2465.9s	2465.9	 Yeah, he's moving in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2466.4s	2466.4	 Yeah, he's measuring the drapes. So, you know, it just goes to show... Does this administration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2471.2s	2471.2	 have control over anything, over the members of their own party? Over 60% of Democrats say they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2476.0s	2476.0	 want someone different to run in 24. So, yes, there was a surface level of consensus and backing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2484.6s	2484.6	 of Pelosi. But if you scratch beneath the surface, you see that the trip was unnecessary and reveals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2490.8s	2490.8	 a president who doesn't seem completely in control of our foreign policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2493.8s	2493.8	 So in a statement, almost universally, the leadership of the Republican Party said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2498.4s	2498.4	 for decades, members of the United States Congress, including previous speakers of the House,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2502.8s	2502.8	 have traveled to Taiwan. This travel is consistent with the United States' one China policy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2507.3s	2507.3	 to which we are committed. We are also committed now, more than ever, to all elements of the Taiwan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2514.2s	2514.2	 Relations Act. So one China, if you don't know, is that Taiwan and China are all part of one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2519.4s	2519.4	 unified entity. So the Republicans seem to be supporting this in a cynical way, you're saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2526.0s	2526.0	 or it is consistent that other members of the United States Congress have gone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2530.7s	2530.7	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2530.8s	2530.8	 including other speakers of the House.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2532.0s	2532.0	 I think there is bipartisan support now to defend Taiwan. I actually think that that is in the cards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2537.0s	2537.0	 I think there's a very high probability that we actually end up in a war with China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2543.5s	2543.5	 Really?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2543.8s	2543.8	 I don't know when, this century. Oh, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2545.7s	2545.7	 I don't think so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2546.5s	2546.5	 I think Taiwan is the biggest flashpoint in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2549.5s	2549.5	 I would agree with that. But explain why you think there's going to be a war, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2552.6s	2552.6	 I think a lot of people think there's way too much at stake here for there to be a war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2556.3s	2556.3	 So there is going to be some sort of negotiated settlement in the South China Sea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2559.9s	2559.9	 So why would you think, you think the majority of cases there's going to be a war? Really?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2564.1s	2564.1	 You have to look at it, first of all, from the Chinese point of view,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2567.3s	2567.3	 they view Taiwan as sacred territory. And for decades now, they have said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2572.4s	2572.4	 in every single meeting, diplomatic meeting with the US, Taiwan is always their number one issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2577.6s	2577.6	 They are hell bent on the reunification of mainland China with Taiwan. And they would like to do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2585.2s	2585.2	 peacefully through coercion if they can. But I think they will do it militarily,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2589.2s	2589.2	 if they must. And the only question is when they feel that they will be strong enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2594.1s	2594.1	 to basically take the island by force. So that's, I think, the Chinese point of view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2598.0s	2598.0	 And I think America is increasingly committed to the defense of Taiwan. So, you know, we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2605.2s	2605.2	 contradictory statements on this. The one China policy says that we respect that there's one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2612.7s	2612.7	 China, but on the other hand, the Taiwan Relations Act commits us to help in the defense of Taiwan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2618.8s	2618.8	 So we have a contradictory policy on this. But if you really want to see…
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2622.8s	2622.8	 And by the way, as does Sachs, you would agree, China has flipped up on this. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2626.6s	2626.6	 it's only the last hundred years that they've really considered Taiwan strategic. They didn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2629.8s	2629.8	 care about it two or three hundred years ago. They were kind of like, this is worthless. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2632.9s	2632.9	 guys do what you want. That's because Taiwan was part of China until 1895 when Japan took it from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2638.5s	2638.5	 them. Yeah. They didn't want it at that time. That's the other thing. They were like, this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2642.9s	2642.9	 worthless real estate. We don't care. It's only…
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2644.2s	2644.2	 No, that's not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2646.3s	2646.3	 Taiwan is extremely important strategically. And if you want to understand why,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2650.8s	2650.8	 I think you need to look at this map of the island chains. Can we pull that up, actually?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2656.5s	2656.5	 Yeah, it's a really interesting discussion because two hundred years ago, they didn't care. And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2659.5s	2659.5	 all of a sudden, they're like, wait a second, if we're going to be in wars with the West and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2662.3s	2662.3	 Japan's going to be a democracy, we do actually have something at stake here. We'd like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2666.1s	2666.1	 island back. The island chain strategy was originally created by John Foster Dulles, this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2671.8s	2671.8	 one of the… The secretary of state, I think, under Eisenhower, who was one of the initial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2677.1s	2677.1	 architects of our containment policy against the Soviet Union, but also came with this idea of how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2681.2s	2681.2	 we would contain China in East Asia. And the basic idea is that China is surrounded by a series of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2688.9s	2688.9	 island chains. The first island chain goes down from the southern tip of Japan to Okinawa, to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2694.2s	2694.2	 Taiwan, to I think there's some islands in the South China Sea, the Spratly Islands. It's got the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2700.9s	2700.9	 northwest tip of the Philippines. That's the first island chain. Second island chain goes out to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2707.1s	2707.1	 Vietnam. The eastern part of the Philippines. No, Vietnam's all the way down in the South China Sea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2711.9s	2711.9	 Oh, yeah. I see what you're saying. The second island chain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2713.1s	2713.1	 The second island chain goes down to Indonesia. And then I think there's even a third island
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2719.3s	2719.3	 chain that includes Guam, although Guam actually might be in the second, somewhere around there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2724.0s	2724.0	 It's a heavily fortified American base. So the idea is if you want to bottle up and contain China,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2729.8s	2729.8	 you do it by controlling these island chains. And Taiwan is really the central one. It sort
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2736.3s	2736.3	 of divides this East China Sea where you've got South Korea and Japan from the South China Sea,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2742.1s	2742.1	 where you've got Vietnam and Malaysia. If we distance between Vietnam and Japan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2746.7s	2746.7	 it's literally if you were to draw a center line of China's coastal access, that is it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2751.4s	2751.4	 Yeah. So the bottom line is this. If you want to pursue a policy of containment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2756.3s	2756.3	 against China, you really want to control these island chains. Another way to think about it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2760.8s	2760.8	 that these islands are unsinkable aircraft carriers. They allow America to project power
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2768.6s	2768.6	 6,000 miles away into the Pacific. That's how we saw it during World War II is we had all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2773.7s	2773.7	 island hopping battles. And as we took these islands, they would then become a runway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2778.4s	2778.4	 for the next stage of to project American power to get all the way to Japan. So, you know, if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2784.2s	2784.2	 believe that we're headed for or we already are in Cold War II with China, and I think we are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2791.0s	2791.0	 I think China is really a geopolitical threat, not Russia. The way that you would contain China
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2798.4s	2798.4	 and keep them bottled up is to have these islands in the American alliance. It's going to be very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2802.9s	2802.9	 hard for China, which is now building a huge blue water Navy, has actually more ships than the United
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2808.1s	2808.1	 States. It's going to be very hard for them to project their power all over the world if they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2812.5s	2812.5	 are contained and bottled up and have to watch their own backs in East Asia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2815.4s	2815.4	 One note on the number of ships though, Zach, is they have a lot of small ships. The tonnage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2820.9s	2820.9	 wise, we have much more tonnage. And if you were to look, even the perfect setup, as you explained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2827.6s	2827.6	 through these islands, is very similar to NATO and what's happening with Russia. We have Korea,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2833.5s	2833.5	 we have Japan, we have Vietnam, the Philippines. We have an incredible alliance in this area. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2840.7s	2840.7	 that's a great thing for America. And Taiwan obviously is a jump ball here. But this is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2846.3s	2846.3	 setup for China having... Jason, what do you think about the repercussions of her visit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2852.2s	2852.2	 So CATL, which is Tesla's biggest battery supplier, basically delayed the announcement of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2859.3s	2859.3	 factory. It's not clear whether they're going to put it into the United States. They may actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2863.1s	2863.1	 pick a city in Mexico. But the decision that was supposed to happen now has now been delayed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2868.1s	2868.1	 until September or October. There's a bunch of, you know, there's all of these crazy military
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2872.8s	2872.8	 drills that happened. Was it all worth it? I mean, that is the question. And I'm asking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2877.1s	2877.1	 why now? Was it worth it? We don't have enough information, I think, to know why this was done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2882.9s	2882.9	 now. Was it a freelance offer? Hold on, hold on. He asked me a question. Let me finish. Is it a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2887.9s	2887.9	 freelance and Nancy Pelosi is completely freelance? Or is there a bigger strategy here is the question,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2892.8s	2892.8	 is China weak now? Are we trying to send a message to them? And one could equally take the side of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2900.0s	2900.0	 the argument that the United States supporting Finland, supporting Sweden, supporting NATO,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2906.4s	2906.4	 you know, supporting the Ukraine and supporting the Pacific is actually the right move here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2911.0s	2911.0	 to contain the dictators. I agree, but we have two people to do that. It's the president and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2916.0s	2916.0	 the secretary of state. Well, that would be a much bigger provocation, I think, is the issue. So if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2921.0s	2921.0	 you sent the president, that would be a very big provocation. The Thomas Friedman article that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2925.2s	2925.2	 Sachs mentions was pretty explicit that, you know, Blinken and Biden both told her, please stand down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2932.6s	2932.6	 Yeah, the NSC and the Joint Chief said, please stand down. You are way over your ski tips here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2938.8s	2938.8	 And she's great. I agree. I've been very public. What is the point of doing this now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2944.2s	2944.2	 is the question. And we don't have information. Once China tried to dictate to Pelosi that she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2949.5s	2949.5	 couldn't go, of course, we had to back her play. But you have to be kind of a fool to fall for this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2954.6s	2954.6	 in the first place. This was self-indulgent by Pelosi. She didn't need to pick this battle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2958.7s	2958.7	 The administration asked her not to. And look, let me give Biden some credit here. Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2963.2s	2963.2	 has the right policy on Taiwan, which was stated this way. He says that we support the status quo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2969.5s	2969.5	 and we are against unilateral changes to the status quo. We want the United States to be a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2973.7s	2973.7	 status quo power with respect to Taiwan and force China to be the revisionist power. And we need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2978.7s	2978.7	 be very careful that we do not come across as the revisionist power that would give China an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlK5tsUuEP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=32&t=2984.5s	2984.5	 excuse. So we want to just maintain the status quo. That should be our policy. All right, everybody.
