https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=148.7s	148.7	 I just got a call.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=149.9s	149.9	 Oh, yeah. Confirm me. Nobody gives a fuck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=154.3s	154.3	 Fucking Christ.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=159.2s	159.2	 I don't think it's inane at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=160.3s	160.3	 This matters to exactly one person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=162.7s	162.7	 No, the person selling you the twitters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=164.9s	164.9	 No, that's not that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=165.8s	165.8	 I think if you took a poll on Twitter, there's a lot of people who silently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=169.8s	169.8	 hate it but love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=170.9s	170.9	 I think a lot more who hate it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=173.3s	173.3	 Let's get to all the news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=175.7s	175.7	 So much news going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=177.4s	177.4	 All the news. Where should we start, Jason?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=179.2s	179.2	 On a Friday. I'm trying to think about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=181.0s	181.0	 Was there any news topic this week?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=182.4s	182.4	 Because obviously the war in Ukraine has obviously got everybody in America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=187.5s	187.5	 Oh, wait, no, I'm sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=188.6s	188.6	 That that's not important anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=190.7s	190.7	 We're on to the next thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=192.1s	192.1	 That's only one issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=193.4s	193.4	 Elon put in a bid to buy Twitter outright on Thursday and take the company private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=198.1s	198.1	 and to deal with $43 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=202.6s	202.6	 The most breaking news when we're taping this on Fridays at 11 a.m.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=205.8s	205.8	 when we typically tape this is that the board of directors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=211.3s	211.3	 you know, the professional board of directors has decided they would like to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=214.8s	214.8	 personally sued.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=216.4s	216.4	 I mean, this is the most insane thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=218.5s	218.5	 I woke up and read this and I was like, OK, they're creating a poison pin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=222.7s	222.7	 I'm sorry, a poison pill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=224.9s	224.9	 That's going to give Twitter's existing shareholders the ability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=227.8s	227.8	 to buy more shares if Elon hits 15 percent of the company at a discount.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=234.2s	234.2	 Chamath, explain the concept of a poison pill, just generally speaking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=237.9s	237.9	 and then give us your because everybody knows what's going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=241.4s	241.4	 But like here we are in this whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=242.8s	242.8	 I don't know if this is the seventh or eighth inning of this saga or it's a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=246.6s	246.6	 But where do you think we are in this saga?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=248.7s	248.7	 And then what happens on Monday and describe a poison pill?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=251.6s	251.6	 A poison pill is basically a defensive maneuver
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=255.5s	255.5	 that a board of directors uses to prevent a hostile takeover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=259.9s	259.9	 And basically the simple way it works is it allows the board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=265.3s	265.3	 to create enormous amounts of new shares and effectively dilute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=271.2s	271.2	 the potential hostile acquirer so that it becomes economically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=275.5s	275.5	 unfeasible for them to get enough shares to get control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=278.2s	278.2	 The way that they do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=280.9s	280.9	 Is that they basically give everybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=284.0s	284.0	 except a person that crosses a certain ownership threshold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=287.0s	287.0	 So let's use Twitter as an example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=288.7s	288.7	 So the Twitter's poison pill basically says that if you get to 15 percent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=294.5s	294.5	 you're essentially locked out from a right that then everybody else has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=299.6s	299.6	 that effectively allows them to buy another share of stock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=303.1s	303.1	 And I think it's a 50 percent discount.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=305.6s	305.6	 And so what it does is it creates an incentive to essentially almost double
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=309.8s	309.8	 the fully diluted shares outstanding of the business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=312.9s	312.9	 And what that does is it makes it almost impossible for the person with 15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=316.0s	316.0	 percent to then go and acquire what's necessary to get to 50 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=320.4s	320.4	 There are different kinds of poison pills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=322.3s	322.3	 There's things that you can do with debt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=324.0s	324.0	 There's things that you can do with equity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=326.5s	326.5	 But that's the thing that Twitter did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=328.4s	328.4	 I think if anybody's interested in it, Nick, maybe you can just bring it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=332.1s	332.1	 But you can Google on Wikipedia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=334.3s	334.3	 There's a phenomenal article called Revlon versus McAndrew and Forbes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=339.9s	339.9	 And McAndrew and Forbes was the holding company of this very prolific dealmaker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=345.2s	345.2	 in the 70s, 80s and 90s named Ronald Perlman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=348.0s	348.0	 And what happened was he was a CEO of a company called Pantry Pride
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=354.0s	354.0	 and Pantry Pride made an unsolicited hostile takeover bid for Revlon,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=358.2s	358.2	 which made make up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=360.1s	360.1	 And basically, you know, there was like 40 to 45 bucks a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=364.1s	364.1	 The board instituted all these poison pills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=366.8s	366.8	 The price kept escalating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=368.6s	368.6	 Then a private equity firm stepped in, also tried to compete for the asset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=373.2s	373.2	 All along the way, there was enough shenanigans that essentially what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=378.6s	378.6	 what what Ronald Perlman did was sue Revlon,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=383.8s	383.8	 which went to Delaware court.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=385.6s	385.6	 And from it basically came the current framework of law that we use in this situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=390.4s	390.4	 And basically what it means is that board directors have these fiduciary obligations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=394.9s	394.9	 to their shareholders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=396.9s	396.9	 And in some cases, these are very broad fiduciary obligations, meaning do the right thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=401.9s	401.9	 But in some really narrow circumstances, all of that collapses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=405.8s	405.8	 And their sole focus is to get the best price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=409.3s	409.3	 And what a director and a board of directors typically wants to do in a situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=413.2s	413.2	 like this is not end up in that second bucket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=416.5s	416.5	 They want to keep all their options available.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=418.3s	418.3	 They don't necessarily want to sell to one person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=420.8s	420.8	 You know, they're probably going to assume they're going to get fired from the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=424.0s	424.0	 They want to stay on for different reasons, et cetera, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=427.2s	427.2	 And so right now, what Twitter and their advisors are trying to do is basically stay in that first bucket,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=432.6s	432.6	 have all of the options available to them and not be forced to run an auction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=437.5s	437.5	 And I think what Elon will try to do is essentially use the public pressure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=443.4s	443.4	 that's going to build and the existing shareholders who own stock at 40 some odd dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=449.1s	449.1	 A chance to basically get, you know, a 20 percent payday
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=453.6s	453.6	 by selling it to Elon for 54 bucks or 53, whatever the price was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=459.0s	459.0	 And the Twitter board now will have to justify how whatever they come up with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=464.6s	464.6	 is better than this, because then if they don't and they're still exercising this broad fiduciary obligations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=471.7s	471.7	 you know, one thing I'll tell you as a public company director, it is a horrendous process when you get sued.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=478.4s	478.4	 And these guys will be in court for years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=482.2s	482.2	 And the incremental pressure that this Twitter board has is that they can be held personally liable here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=488.6s	488.6	 So I think it's getting very complicated, very.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=491.0s	491.0	 OK, on that note of personal liability, you have directors insurance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=495.1s	495.1	 So that's how can that pierce?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=497.2s	497.2	 Doesn't cover it. Doesn't cover it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=498.8s	498.8	 Have there been examples of this happening?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=500.9s	500.9	 Yeah, you know, insurance is it's kind of like Dino insurance is their director and officer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=504.9s	504.9	 Insurance is a layer of protection that we all have as public company directors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=509.7s	509.7	 We actually also have it as private company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=512.1s	512.1	 Yeah. But the amount of coverage changes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=515.6s	515.6	 But what I'll tell you is Dino coverage tends to be relatively nominal because the risk profile doesn't really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=521.8s	521.8	 include these kinds of tail events.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=523.5s	523.5	 And now what you're talking about is 10 to 15 billion dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=528.9s	528.9	 of equity value that's going to either get created for existing shareholders or get taken away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=535.0s	535.0	 And typically what courts will do is that they will look at the amount of money and they will start to think about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=542.2s	542.2	 you know, compensatory impugnitive damages as a function of how much money was was made or lost.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=547.5s	547.5	 And so you're talking about a realm of of risk now for these directors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=551.2s	551.2	 That's well beyond what Dino insurance will cover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=553.1s	553.1	 So when the velocity did happen, you have to find damages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=556.6s	556.6	 So if the board found a better offer, great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=559.2s	559.2	 But if this thing goes down on Monday, Elon sells his shares and it goes down to 30.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=565.4s	565.4	 Now you have the opposite effect. Go ahead, free bird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=567.9s	567.9	 So I'll say two things. One is in all these cases, by the way, the board is indemnified by the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=573.9s	573.9	 So the individual board members, I don't know if there's ever been a point in history when an individual board members had to pay out of pocket
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=580.2s	580.2	 for liability associated with their actions as a board member and as a fiduciary, except when they've done something to benefit themselves outside of the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=588.8s	588.8	 Now, in this case, the job of the board is to use their best judgment to do what they believe to be in the best interest of creating the best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=597.6s	597.6	 and the most value possible for the shareholders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=601.3s	601.3	 It's very simple when the stock price is at 30 and someone says, I'll give you 50 bucks to say, oh, well, obviously getting 50 bucks is in the best interest of the shareholders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=611.1s	611.1	 Let's assume, though, that you're on that board and you know about some super secret plan that you believe in the next 30 days is going to get the stock price to 60.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=619.9s	619.9	 Then your belief in that plan and your understanding of that plan gives you a good rationale for having a debate as a board that this deal doesn't make sense at 50.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=629.4s	629.4	 We should hold out until we finish our plan over the next 30 days, get the stock up to 60, and then we'll see if someone comes in and says, hey, I'll give you even more than 60.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=638.4s	638.4	 Could be something on the product roadmap, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=640.4s	640.4	 This is the complicated point. It's not just about the current share price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=643.8s	643.8	 It's a very interesting history in the 80s and 90s, early 90s when stocks would drop tremendously for market volatility reasons or some bad news event or someone quits the board macro.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=654.8s	654.8	 And all of a sudden, the stock price drops and you have a hostile buyer that says, oh, my God, this company looks super cheap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=660.8s	660.8	 I'm going to come in and buy it while it's cheap and I'll offer them a premium to the current share price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=665.8s	665.8	 And the share price recently may have been much higher than the price that's being offered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=670.2s	670.2	 And the board says, you know what, we're going to get back to that share price because the market will pick up again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=675.2s	675.2	 The things we're working on are going to grow us out of this hole.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=678.2s	678.2	 And so it's very hard for us to sit here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=681.2s	681.2	 And I know that I want everyone here on the Zoom to suspend your alliance to Elon and believe that Elon will do a better job just for one second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=688.2s	688.2	 And just think about the board members.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=690.2s	690.2	 They've all been working on quarterly plans, strategic plans, et cetera, with the current CEO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=694.7s	694.7	 And so the board has a board for Twitter that gives them a point of view that says, may give them a point of view that says, hey, you know what, we can get back to 70 bucks a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=701.7s	701.7	 So remember, it was only a few months ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=703.7s	703.7	 Twitter stock was trading at 70.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=705.7s	705.7	 The stock price dropped with market compression we've all experienced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=708.7s	708.7	 And then Elon's come along and said, I'll offer you guys 54 bucks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=711.7s	711.7	 And the board's like, wait, a few months ago, we were at 70.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=714.7s	714.7	 We have all these great things we're working on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=716.7s	716.7	 And so I'm just trying to paint the other side for everyone that this is not just like a clear cut, obvious deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=722.1s	722.1	 I think it's their judgment at this point that they should get more for the stock given where they think the company's headed and where the stock price will eventually get to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=729.1s	729.1	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=730.1s	730.1	 Going to you, Sax, you heard from Friedberg to suspend disbelief that the greatest entrepreneur on the planet running two of the most important companies is not more qualified to run Twitter than the current CEO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=741.1s	741.1	 I'm not going to suspend my disbelief.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=744.1s	744.1	 Let me make the case for the clear cut case here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=747.1s	747.1	 Sorry, let me just say something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=749.1s	749.1	 He could be better at running this company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=751.6s	751.6	 OK, he will be better, Jason, but the shareholders don't benefit from that because he buys the whole company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=756.6s	756.6	 Of course they do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=757.6s	757.6	 Well, hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=758.6s	758.6	 Yeah, they're getting $54 of cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=760.6s	760.6	 They do not have any ownership in Twitter after Elon takes over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=763.6s	763.6	 That's the deal that's on the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=765.6s	765.6	 So if I as a shareholder get $54 of cash, I don't care if Elon does a better job running Twitter down the road because I have no interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=772.6s	772.6	 Suddenly, one fact check on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=774.6s	774.6	 One fact check on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=775.6s	775.6	 He said he wants to bring along as many of the shareholders as possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=777.6s	777.6	 That's a thing he said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=778.6s	778.6	 That's not actually in the proposal, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=781.0s	781.0	 So as a board member, I have to look at the proposal on the table, which is I got to take $54 of cash for my shares and give up all the upside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=788.0s	788.0	 Saks looks like he's going to explode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=790.0s	790.0	 Fair enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=791.0s	791.0	 Look, here's the reason why fiduciary duties exist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=794.0s	794.0	 Let's just explain where this concept comes from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=796.0s	796.0	 There is fundamentally a principal agent problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=799.0s	799.0	 This is what it's known as between stockholders and the people running the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=804.0s	804.0	 So in other words, the owners of the company are the stockholders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=808.4s	808.4	 They appoint agents, managers to run the company for them, but those managers can be conflicted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=815.4s	815.4	 They have an incentive not just to get the highest share price for the stockholders, but to pocket personally as many benefits as they can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=822.4s	822.4	 And the whole reason why fiduciary duty was invented is to prevent that agency problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=828.4s	828.4	 So if the board members or the CEO of the company are just looking out for themselves and trying to pocket personal benefits,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=835.9s	835.9	 excessive compensation or turning down an offer to sell the company for a much higher price,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=840.9s	840.9	 that would be a breach of their fiduciary duty because they're looking out for themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=843.9s	843.9	 Perog knows that if Elon buys this company, he is out of a job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=848.9s	848.9	 His head is on the chopping block.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=850.9s	850.9	 He is fired right away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=851.9s	851.9	 Elon has made that clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=852.9s	852.9	 He said in this letter on this SEC filing on Thursday, I have no confidence in the management of the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=860.9s	860.9	 If I'm unable to buy the whole thing and take it private, I will dump all my shares.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=865.3s	865.3	 It's all or nothing for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=866.3s	866.3	 So Perog is interested in preserving his job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=869.3s	869.3	 If Elon wins this battle, Perog is going to have the shortest executive career since that pope who got poisoned, OK, to borrow a line from Wall Street.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=877.3s	877.3	 So he is incentivized to fight this thing, whether it's in the interest of shareholders or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=882.3s	882.3	 Now, what do you think the incentives of the board are?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=885.3s	885.3	 I think they're the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=886.3s	886.3	 These are guys who love the power they derive from being on this board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=892.8s	892.8	 We know Twitter has enormous cultural power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=895.8s	895.8	 These guys, they enjoy all the benefits they get.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=898.8s	898.8	 They probably do get some compensation being on the board, but they enjoy being in this very exclusive club that wields enormous power over our culture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=907.8s	907.8	 And they have no incentive to give that up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=909.8s	909.8	 And by the way, how much of the company do they really own?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=912.8s	912.8	 You know, not that much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=913.8s	913.8	 If you look at the wealth of the people on Twitter's board, and we know all the people on Twitter's board, their wealth is significantly greater than whether Twitter stock sells for 60 or 70.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=922.8s	922.8	 So and I think that we all know that these are all sophisticated actors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=926.8s	926.8	 They are all high integrity people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=929.8s	929.8	 We all personally know many of the people on Twitter's board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=931.8s	931.8	 I don't think that, you know, look, maybe there's a variety of people on the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=935.8s	935.8	 They're conflicted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=936.8s	936.8	 It's got nothing to do with integrity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=937.8s	937.8	 The fact of the matter is...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=938.8s	938.8	 But you could say the same about any board, Sachs, that it's...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=940.8s	940.8	 No, because it's different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=942.8s	942.8	 Listen, when we're on a board, OK, because I'm on plenty of boards, we own a huge percentage of the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=949.2s	949.2	 So when somebody makes a takeover offer to buy one of our companies, we are thinking like stockholders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=955.2s	955.2	 We're fundamentally aligned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=956.2s	956.2	 You have massive skin in the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=957.2s	957.2	 We have massive skin in the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=958.2s	958.2	 These people on the board, what skin in the game do they have?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=961.2s	961.2	 Most of them are these directors who are disappointed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=964.2s	964.2	 And it's like a club.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=965.2s	965.2	 These guys, it's all big backscratching club.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=968.2s	968.2	 These guys are all on a bunch of different boards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=970.2s	970.2	 So wait, you think they're motivated by the influence of being a Twitter board member?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=972.2s	972.2	 Yes, of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=973.2s	973.2	 Being at the nexus of power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=974.2s	974.2	 Why do they serve on these boards?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=975.6s	975.6	 What this is shaping up to be is the nexus of power and who controls the power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=978.6s	978.6	 By the way, none of them own much of Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=980.6s	980.6	 None of them own much of Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=981.6s	981.6	 I do 100% agree with Sachs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=983.6s	983.6	 I've always believed what I think Carl Icahn said or whoever it was, that the board should be represented by the biggest shareholders,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=990.6s	990.6	 the folks who actually have skin in the game, the folks who actually care about the share price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=995.6s	995.6	 You know, having some nominal number of shares issued to you as a board member of a public company,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=999.6s	999.6	 showing up, you know, patting each other in the back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1002.1s	1002.1	 It certainly, generally speaking, leads to non-founder led companies ultimately dying because there is no motivation and incentive and drive from anyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1012.1s	1012.1	 Let me take the other side partially.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1014.1s	1014.1	 I think you're mostly right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1016.1s	1016.1	 I would never join a public company board that I did not own a significant piece of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1021.1s	1021.1	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1022.1s	1022.1	 And I have never.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1023.1s	1023.1	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1024.1s	1024.1	 Now, the reason to be on a public company board is that unlike a private company, the single biggest advantage,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1030.5s	1030.5	 there are many disadvantages of being public, but the single biggest advantage of being public is that you have a lower cost of capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1038.5s	1038.5	 So if you have an ambitious company, an ambitious leader and an ambitious plan to build and compound value, you cannot do it privately forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1047.5s	1047.5	 You must do it in the public markets because there's just an infinite amount of capital that's available and an infinite amount of ways in which you can raise capital relative to you being private.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1059.0s	1059.0	 So that being said, when you are public, I think the best boards are the ones that are sort of 50-50 split between the biggest shareholders and people who are very much experts in a handful of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1072.0s	1072.0	 And I just want to be specific.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1074.0s	1074.0	 In a public company board, you have to have a lot of focus these days on things like governance audit because you have to attest to these financial statements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1084.0s	1084.0	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1085.4s	1085.4	 Cybersecurity becomes a huge one because you have to disclose these risks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1089.4s	1089.4	 And so I think that it really behooves boards to have a few experts who can chair those committees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1097.4s	1097.4	 Compensation tends to be another one, as David mentioned, that can be a real hot button.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1101.4s	1101.4	 But there are experts you can find.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1103.4s	1103.4	 They're not going to own a large piece of the company, but they're going to do a really good job of managing those things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1108.8s	1108.8	 That minimizes risk for the business so that then the rest of the board, which are the large shareholders, can really use their influence and strategic understanding of the business to build a huge equity value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1122.8s	1122.8	 When those things come together, you have great outcomes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1125.8s	1125.8	 But I really agree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1127.8s	1127.8	 If you stack the board and, you know, we've had this issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1131.3s	1131.3	 Public boards in America got perverted over the last sort of last few decades to being these little badges of status that people would collect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1140.3s	1140.3	 And now, you know, we're starting to see a real pushback on what's called overboarding, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1144.3s	1144.3	 Where these distinguished folks will pick up five, six, seven boards all of a sudden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1148.3s	1148.3	 That's the fastest way to make three, four, five, six million dollars a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1152.3s	1152.3	 How can you sit on five or six company public company boards?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1154.3s	1154.3	 It's impossible and at any value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1156.3s	1156.3	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1157.7s	1157.7	 Do you think those people get appointed to boards by standing up to the CEO?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1161.7s	1161.7	 No, the opposite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1162.7s	1162.7	 They're there to be a safe vote for the CEO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1165.7s	1165.7	 So let me ask you guys a question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1166.7s	1166.7	 What do you think is the right thing to do as companies that go public mature and their ownership base disperses?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1173.7s	1173.7	 So, you know, in Europe and Asia, many companies go public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1176.7s	1176.7	 Families own them for a very long period of time, as you guys know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1179.7s	1179.7	 They remain significant owners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1181.7s	1181.7	 They don't sell off the shares.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1183.2s	1183.2	 In the U.S., traditionally, as companies have gone public, the shares, the founders, the original investors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1190.2s	1190.2	 because we have a lot of venture capital in this country, historically compared to other countries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1196.2s	1196.2	 So those owners end up selling off their shares and they get dispersed and a long tail of owners end up owning the bulk of the shares.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1203.2s	1203.2	 How do you think those companies can be best represented on the board given that there isn't concentrated ownership in public companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1210.6s	1210.6	 generally mature public companies in the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1212.6s	1212.6	 like Twitter, the largest owner is Vanguard with five million other investments and then Jack Dorsey, he only owns 2%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1219.6s	1219.6	 What do you guys think is the right thing to how do you create good alignment with board members that could be better placed and better suited here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1226.6s	1226.6	 Well, I think one of the ways that you do it is that when somebody wants to step up and acquire a concentrated position because they have a plan for the company,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1233.6s	1233.6	 you don't stand in the way and completely thwart that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1236.0s	1236.0	 Your job isn't to assess their plan because your job is to assess the dollars you're getting paid today for your shareholders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1241.0s	1241.0	 and then whatever they're going to do with it, it's their thing, but are you getting a fair price? Is it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1245.0s	1245.0	 Elon is willing to put massive skin to the game in order to basically fix this company and get the best value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1251.0s	1251.0	 We all agree, but that's not about the shareholders, Sachs. I agree with you. I think Elon should own and run Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1256.0s	1256.0	 Let's evaluate this poison pill for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1260.5s	1260.5	 Elon comes in, he starts buying up the stock. The premium he's proposing is something like a 50 something percent premium from when he started accumulating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1269.5s	1269.5	 54% is like a 38%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1272.5s	1272.5	 But a 40% discount.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1273.5s	1273.5	 From the time he basically made the offer, and by the way, the stock is going right back to that previous level if they turn down this proposal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1281.5s	1281.5	 He's made them a good offer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1283.9s	1283.9	 Okay, now I think it would be acceptable for the board to say, okay, this offer is attractive, but we need to shop this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1289.9s	1289.9	 We're going to run a process and we're going to see who else is out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1293.9s	1293.9	 And if there's nobody better, then we're, you know, why wouldn't we take this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1297.9s	1297.9	 There's one thing that's left over that you didn't mention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1299.9s	1299.9	 The thing that's left over, you're right, they absolutely have a responsibility to shop it and find the best price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1303.9s	1303.9	 But what's left over is their judgment that the company's stock price will get above that level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1310.4s	1310.4	 They have the ability and the right to do that and the responsibility to do that as a board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1314.4s	1314.4	 This happens all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1316.4s	1316.4	 The board can look at the deal and they can say, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1318.4s	1318.4	 We believe that this business in the future is going to be worth a lot more than what we're being offered for cash today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1324.4s	1324.4	 So they have some inside information.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1326.4s	1326.4	 The problem with that argument is that this is what activist firms use all the time in reverse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1334.4s	1334.4	 The inverse of the argument is more powerful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1337.8s	1337.8	 You've been a director with purview into all these confidential plans that has effectively caused this company to tread water for five years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1345.8s	1345.8	 Why should we believe you now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1347.8s	1347.8	 And that argument is way more credible than actually you can really trust us this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1353.8s	1353.8	 Because if you look at the tenure of all these folks, you know, the last sea change that happened on the Twitter board was when Elliott pushed to add, I think, two or three directors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1361.8s	1361.8	 But in the absence of that, I think David is largely right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1365.2s	1365.2	 These are status games.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1367.2s	1367.2	 And when status games ultimately play out over years, they either play out in the stock price one one way or the other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1374.2s	1374.2	 And in this case, what's true is that this is a languishing stock that has largely been going sideways, independent of anything that's been happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1383.2s	1383.2	 And what about the fact, Chamath, that less than 90 days ago it was trading at $70?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1388.2s	1388.2	 You mean during the COVID bump when everybody was betting stocks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1391.2s	1391.2	 I mean, let's look at the history of Friedberg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1393.7s	1393.7	 $69.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1394.7s	1394.7	 Guys, just remember, I'm not arguing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1396.7s	1396.7	 Hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1397.7s	1397.7	 You have to give some context.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1399.7s	1399.7	 January 3rd, 2014, the stock was trading at $69.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1404.7s	1404.7	 The fact that it got a ridiculous bump like the entire market did during the Robin Hood, Stonks, you know, heyday during COVID means nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1413.7s	1413.7	 I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1414.7s	1414.7	 Right. That was market beta, not their performance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1416.7s	1416.7	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1417.7s	1417.7	 That's exactly what I was going to say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1420.1s	1420.1	 If you could actually point to some alpha, meaning there was a strategic misstep or something that happened that was fixable, a better example would be, let's just say that there was a let's just say that that Twitter instead was not a technology company, but a pharma company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1436.1s	1436.1	 This example would be easier to understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1438.1s	1438.1	 The stock is at $69 and you get some interim results from your phase three trial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1444.1s	1444.1	 People misread it and the stock tanks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1447.6s	1447.6	 Meanwhile, the stock market, broadly speaking, is at the same level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1451.6s	1451.6	 You could say, well, that negative alpha can actually be fixed because of our strategic plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1457.6s	1457.6	 But what Sachs just said is more true in this case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1460.6s	1460.6	 In this case, what's irrefutable is that there's been a broad based drawdown in the markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1465.6s	1465.6	 There is nothing that you can point to that says this is something inside of Twitter's control to get the stock back to $69, meaning 69 three months ago is actually 38 or 40.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1477.0s	1477.0	 Today, we're we're we're in apples to apples even comparison.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1481.0s	1481.0	 So from there, the real question is this 20 or 30 percent premium to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1486.0s	1486.0	 Can you actually show a plan?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1488.0s	1488.0	 I think the right thing for Twitter's board to do, just to be very precise, is the following.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1493.0s	1493.0	 They have to take Elon's offer and they have to create a go shop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1498.0s	1498.0	 I will go and try to get a better price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1501.4s	1501.4	 They won't be able to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1502.4s	1502.4	 And the reason they won't be able to is not a single person who is capable of stepping up with 43 billion dollars would ever get it through regulatory muster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1510.4s	1510.4	 Not going to happen, in my opinion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1512.4s	1512.4	 And anybody with the 43 billion who could buy it will never take it on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1516.4s	1516.4	 Meaning, could Comcast show up?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1518.4s	1518.4	 Sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1519.4s	1519.4	 Could Disney show up?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1521.4s	1521.4	 They'll never even look at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1522.4s	1522.4	 No, they're not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1523.4s	1523.4	 The people for whom this asset is strategic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1526.4s	1526.4	 Apple, Facebook, Google can bite dance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1529.9s	1529.9	 Amazon can never get it done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1531.9s	1531.9	 Nina Kahn, no Brenno.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1533.9s	1533.9	 I think that's probably right, Chamath, but there is a chance that they do get a higher bid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1536.9s	1536.9	 I just want to finish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1537.9s	1537.9	 From who?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1538.9s	1538.9	 Just let me finish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1539.9s	1539.9	 Okay, I'm going to finish, Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1540.9s	1540.9	 And then Sax who?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1541.9s	1541.9	 So I think basically it's like, Elon, thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1544.9s	1544.9	 We're going to create a go shop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1546.9s	1546.9	 We'll try to find the best offer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1547.9s	1547.9	 I don't think any offer comes in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1548.9s	1548.9	 But then I think what they can do, Freeberg, is if there is this magical plan to shoot rainbows up their ass, they should actually put that to a shareholder vote.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1559.3s	1559.3	 And let people decide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1561.3s	1561.3	 And I think that's a really fair thing to do that also allows them the credibility in the air cover to say, look, we actually have been working on a plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1568.3s	1568.3	 We think that that will create an amazing amount of shareholder value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1573.3s	1573.3	 And we just want shareholders to be able to see that, compare it to Elon's offer and decide for themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1578.3s	1578.3	 Who's the white knight, if anybody?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1580.3s	1580.3	 I heard Comcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1581.3s	1581.3	 We know that Big Tech can't do it because of Nina Kahn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1583.3s	1583.3	 And then we'll go on to the next topic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1584.3s	1584.3	 The next nuance here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1586.8s	1586.8	 Do you have anybody, a financial player, anybody who is a dark horse in your mind?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1591.8s	1591.8	 Somebody, you know, I think it could be Disney.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1593.8s	1593.8	 Jack is on the board of Disney.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1595.8s	1595.8	 There's a lot of relationships.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1597.8s	1597.8	 They tried to buy it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1598.8s	1598.8	 Bob Iger said he bailed on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1600.8s	1600.8	 Listen, I think there's a lot of companies that could be interested in Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1603.8s	1603.8	 And I think you create the period to shop it to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1606.8s	1606.8	 And by the way, listen, name one, Sax, I think this administration does not want to see Twitter become a free speech company again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1615.2s	1615.2	 And so the political winds will blow towards letting I think Twitter be acquired by a Big Tech company, even if it means Big Tech gets bigger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1625.2s	1625.2	 Wait a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1626.2s	1626.2	 So I think they'll put Lena Kahn on pause to allow Google to buy this company if that's what it comes down to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1632.2s	1632.2	 You're kidding me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1633.2s	1633.2	 Your conspiracy theory is that Biden's going to come at hold on a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1636.2s	1636.2	 Will you take 101 odds against that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1638.2s	1638.2	 I'm saying if it comes down to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1640.6s	1640.6	 You're saying Biden's going to whisper in Lena Kahn's ear, put your thumb on the scale and let Google buy this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1647.6s	1647.6	 I'm just saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1648.6s	1648.6	 So that the Dems can own it, the Libs can still own Trump?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1651.6s	1651.6	 I'm saying if it was a choice, if it was a choice between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1653.6s	1653.6	 What David's saying is my enemy's enemy is my friend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1656.6s	1656.6	 And so instead of having Elon's stated goal, I guess what David is saying is instead of having Elon's stated goal of having a free speech platform at scale exist on the internet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1667.1s	1667.1	 which they may believe is even the bigger threat to political power, they'd rather it go into the hands of companies that will acquiesce to them, at least on the margins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1675.1s	1675.1	 But no question about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1676.1s	1676.1	 Biden would tell Lena Kahn to put her thumb on the scale?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1679.1s	1679.1	 It's the lesser of two evils.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1681.1s	1681.1	 You believe that conspiracy theory?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1683.1s	1683.1	 From their point of view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1684.1s	1684.1	 I do not personally, but I'm just trying to explain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1686.1s	1686.1	 I feel like I'm on AM radio, but go on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1689.1s	1689.1	 Listen, where's my tinfoil hat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1694.1s	1694.1	 And by the way, I just want to, just to go back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1696.5s	1696.5	 What is this all about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1697.5s	1697.5	 I just sent you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1698.5s	1698.5	 Hold on one sec.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1699.5s	1699.5	 I just sent you guys the revenue chart for Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1701.5s	1701.5	 It may not be that impressive relative to enterprise software companies and others, but I want to be really clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1707.5s	1707.5	 I am not arguing against this deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1709.5s	1709.5	 I'm trying to give you guys the perspectives that we all have a really kind of honest dialogue about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1714.5s	1714.5	 Why this board may actually stand on their own two feet and win with shareholders by saying, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1721.5s	1721.5	 Look, our revenue has been going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1722.5s	1722.5	 We're continuing to grow revenue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1725.0s	1725.0	 We're continuing to grow usage on the platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1726.0s	1726.0	 We've got all these products that we're working on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1728.0s	1728.0	 There's a real reason that we're going to make more than fifty four dollars a share over the next twelve to eighteen months as we start to deliver this year's numbers and we start to deliver these product features that we've all been sharing and talking about in the progress we've been seeing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1740.0s	1740.0	 And that's the that's honestly, I think the most likely kind of middle ground here is that this board has enough to stand on by looking at the fact that it doesn't matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1748.0s	1748.0	 The stock's gone up and down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1749.4s	1749.4	 What matters is that they've been in their minds steadily improving the business and continuing to improve the business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1754.4s	1754.4	 And it is an iconic asset that the market should own, not a single person and yada yada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1759.4s	1759.4	 And I think that's going to be part of the case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1761.4s	1761.4	 Let me make two points.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1762.4s	1762.4	 First, the problem with Freeberg's argument is that there's no limiting principle to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1766.4s	1766.4	 Any board at any time could always claim that they've seen the magical plan and therefore they can reject the bid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1773.4s	1773.4	 You're right, by the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1774.4s	1774.4	 That's the problem with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1775.4s	1775.4	 Agreed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1776.8s	1776.8	 And particularly in this case, we have to look at the track record of this management team, which barely exists, but also this culture at Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1785.8s	1785.8	 OK, this is a company that's languished for years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1788.8s	1788.8	 The culture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1789.8s	1789.8	 Look, this culture, a decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1791.8s	1791.8	 This culture has been so inept that in response to Elon's takeover offer, they gave all the employees a day of rest because that's a reoccurring monthly thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1800.8s	1800.8	 They have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1801.8s	1801.8	 No, they don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1803.3s	1803.3	 The employees were so stressed out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1806.3s	1806.3	 They told them to stay at home and take it easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1808.3s	1808.3	 OK, this is this is a week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1811.3s	1811.3	 You don't know the emotional labor it takes to deal with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1814.3s	1814.3	 This team is weak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1817.3s	1817.3	 OK, and it's soft.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1820.3s	1820.3	 And Elon would give the whole company an enema and fix this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1825.3s	1825.3	 And that is why they don't want him taking over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1827.3s	1827.3	 You are 100% right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1829.3s	1829.3	 But that's not the question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1831.7s	1831.7	 This is why this is why you should not let this board and this CEO invoke some magical plan that they don't have, that they never came up with and they would never come up with, because this is a big excuse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1842.7s	1842.7	 So they're not out of a job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1843.7s	1843.7	 OK, but now let me go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1845.7s	1845.7	 I never got to make the second point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1847.7s	1847.7	 Let me respond to the tinfoil hat thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1849.7s	1849.7	 So listen, what is this story really about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1853.7s	1853.7	 It's about free speech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1854.7s	1854.7	 It's what it's about for Elon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1857.2s	1857.2	 And then at the speech that he gave at TED that, listen, this is not about economics for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1860.2s	1860.2	 Twitter needs to be the open town square.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1862.2s	1862.2	 It is the marketplace for ideas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1864.2s	1864.2	 We're going to make it a free speech platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1866.2s	1866.2	 We're going to open source the algorithm so people know when they're being canceled, they know why they were taken down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1869.2s	1869.2	 Is that algorithmic?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1870.2s	1870.2	 Was that a human intervention?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1872.2s	1872.2	 This is what it's about for Elon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1874.2s	1874.2	 It's also what it's about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1875.2s	1875.2	 Hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1876.2s	1876.2	 It's also what it's about for all the elites, for everyone observing this, for everyone who's criticizing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1879.2s	1879.2	 It's also what it's about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1881.2s	1881.2	 Hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1882.2s	1882.2	 It's also what it's about for all the elites, for everyone observing this, for everyone who's criticizing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1885.6s	1885.6	 Listen, look at the reactions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1888.6s	1888.6	 We haven't talked at all about the hysterical reactions to all of this news that happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1891.6s	1891.6	 I mean, there was a fantastic tweet here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1894.6s	1894.6	 Well, Business Insider said that Elon Musk's attempt to buy Twitter represents a chilly new threat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1897.6s	1897.6	 Billionaire trolls taking over social media.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1899.6s	1899.6	 This is one problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1901.6s	1901.6	 Back in 2013, Business Insider's headline was, billionaire Jeff Bezos wash and post by marks a fascinating cultural transition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1904.6s	1904.6	 This is one problem.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1910.6s	1910.6	 This is one problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1913.7s	1913.7	 This is one problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1916.7s	1916.7	 Today, Twitter, even if you have Twitter, even if you have a keyboard, even if you have a desktop or a desktop, even if you have a tablet, even if you have a mobile device, even if you have a laptop, even if you have a desktop, it still marks a fascinating cultural transition in America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1917.7s	1917.7	 These guys are completely hypocritical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1919.7s	1919.7	 When it's a billionaire that they like, they praise it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1921.7s	1921.7	 When it's a billionaire supporting free speech, they oppose it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1923.7s	1923.7	 That's what's going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1924.7s	1924.7	 You had Jeff Jarvis with this insane...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1926.7s	1926.7	 Professor Jeff Jarvis?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1928.7s	1928.7	 Yes, saying, today on Twitter feels like the last evening in a Berlin nightclub at the twilight of Weimar, Germany.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1931.7s	1931.7	 I mean, somehow these people think that the reinstitution, the restoration of free speech, is somehow like the history of the social network.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1934.8s	1934.8	 I mean, somehow these people think that the reinstitution, the restoration of free speech, is somehow like the end of Weimar, Germany.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1945.8s	1945.8	 And then I think probably the best example was this tweet by Max Boot, where he says that for democracy to survive, we need more content moderation, i.e. censorship, not less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1957.9s	1957.9	 So in the warped mind of all of these elites and the media, the corporate media, they think that for democracy to survive, they need more censorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1966.9s	1966.9	 It's crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1967.9s	1967.9	 This is the worst thing the Democrats ever did, is give the Republican Party free speech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1971.9s	1971.9	 That was our issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1972.9s	1972.9	 How we gave it to you guys is just insane, David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1974.9s	1974.9	 By the way, this is your bias in evaluating this deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1976.9s	1976.9	 I want to point that out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1978.9s	1978.9	 You talk about the board's bias, but you do have a bias on...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1980.9s	1980.9	 And that's not really the question at hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1982.9s	1982.9	 The question at hand is $54 is the fair price to pay for this company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1987.0s	1987.0	 I know, but it is also about free speech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1989.0s	1989.0	 There is another issue here at its core.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1991.0s	1991.0	 That's not that, sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1993.0s	1993.0	
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1993.0s	1993.0	 It's not about the deal, but that is why Elon's buying the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1996.0s	1996.0	 I agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1997.0s	1997.0	
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1997.0s	1997.0	 I agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1998.0s	1998.0	 He's not doing it for profit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=1999.0s	1999.0	 I'm just pointing out that we all criticize the board and we all criticize them for not taking the deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2003.0s	2003.0	 We're motivated generally because we want to see the deal happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2006.0s	2006.0	 We want to see Elon do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2007.0s	2007.0	 I want to be very clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2008.0s	2008.0	 A couple of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2009.0s	2009.0	 First of all, the stock is basically the same price it was in December of 2013.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2015.0s	2015.0	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2016.1s	2016.1	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2017.1s	2017.1	 What happened in the market during that time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2020.1s	2020.1	 It went absolutely up and to the right in a violent manner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2023.1s	2023.1	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2024.1s	2024.1	 If you had a strategy to not grow and you deployed it, could you actually achieve this performance?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2030.1s	2030.1	 I'm just saying that's just an objective fact that we have to keep in mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2033.1s	2033.1	 Whatever has happened has collectively not worked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2037.1s	2037.1	 It is systematic, meaning the underperformance is not a quarter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2041.1s	2041.1	 It's not in a month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2043.2s	2043.2	 But whatever has happened here collectively inside this business has not been working
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2048.2s	2048.2	 for nearly a decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2050.2s	2050.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2051.2s	2051.2	 So just getting all the emotion out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2052.2s	2052.2	 That's a fact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2053.2s	2053.2	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2054.2s	2054.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2055.2s	2055.2	 And so at some point people will say, well, the devil I don't know is better than the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2058.7s	2058.7	 devil I do know because devil I do know is destroying money for me at a horrific rate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2064.1s	2064.1	 which if you look at how the S&P has compounded since 2013 versus now, I mean, my gosh, if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2069.9s	2069.9	 you had done a spread trade of long the S&P and short Twitter, you would have made a fortune.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2073.9s	2073.9	 How about long Tesla short Twitter?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2075.9s	2075.9	 Well, I'm just trying to give the general market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2077.9s	2077.9	 No, I'm just trying to give you the general market math, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2080.9s	2080.9	 Forget any individual.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2081.9s	2081.9	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2082.9s	2082.9	 And look, it's not just ideological here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2084.9s	2084.9	 I think we all agree on the correct economic thing to have happened here, which is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2088.9s	2088.9	 the Twitter board should run a process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2090.9s	2090.9	 They should see if there's a better bid out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2092.9s	2092.9	 If there is, you play for the bigger bid, make Elon come up on the price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2096.9s	2096.9	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2098.0s	2098.0	 If there's a better bid, Elon's offer is the best deal on the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2102.0s	2102.0	 I think you take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2103.0s	2103.0	 That's what economically should happen, but it's not going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2106.0s	2106.0	 And the reason it's not going to happen is not because of superior economics or a magical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2110.0s	2110.0	 plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2111.0s	2111.0	 It's going to be caused the the board members on this country club.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2114.0s	2114.0	 They call a board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2115.0s	2115.0	 Their interest is to stay on that board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2117.0s	2117.0	 Parag's interest to stay as CEO and all the elite observers in the media, all the people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2122.0s	2122.0	 denouncing Twitter, give you guys numbers to want censorship to remain in place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2126.0s	2126.0	 That is what's going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2127.1s	2127.1	 I want to ask one question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2128.1s	2128.1	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2129.1s	2129.1	 You have a lot of Bitcoin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2130.1s	2130.1	 You have a little bit of Bitcoin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2132.1s	2132.1	 Bitcoin is like Bitcoin's trading like 40,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2135.1s	2135.1	 If I said I'm going to buy out all your Bitcoin for 45,000, would you take it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2140.1s	2140.1	 Well, that's a it's a different situation because you can't you can't make an offer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2144.1s	2144.1	 for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2145.1s	2145.1	 And by the way, there's no answer here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2148.1s	2148.1	 Here's the difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2149.1s	2149.1	 There's no principal agent problem in that context.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2151.1s	2151.1	 I know it's a fully decentralized currency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2154.1s	2154.1	 You have a point of view on Bitcoin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2156.2s	2156.2	 Forget about the structure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2157.2s	2157.2	 I'm coming to you and I'm saying, hey, Sax, I want to buy all your Bitcoin for 45,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2160.2s	2160.2	 What's your answer?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2161.2s	2161.2	 It's trading.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2162.2s	2162.2	 That's not a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2163.2s	2163.2	 That's not a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2164.2s	2164.2	 So then put it put it to a vote.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2167.2s	2167.2	 I'm trading.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2169.2s	2169.2	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2170.2s	2170.2	 Let every single shareholder decide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2171.2s	2171.2	 Then put it to a vote and we'll see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2172.2s	2172.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2173.2s	2173.2	 And by the way, Freeberg, there's no limits on your ability to go on the open market and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2177.0s	2177.0	 buy Bitcoin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2178.3s	2178.3	 So if you do want to try and acquire 100% of Bitcoin, go on the open market and acquire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2183.3s	2183.3	 it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2184.5s	2184.5	 There are people trying to build big positions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2185.5s	2185.5	 Yeah, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2186.5s	2186.5	 So go do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2187.5s	2187.5	 But there are huge limits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2188.5s	2188.5	 I just want to hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2189.5s	2189.5	 There are big limits on the ability of Elon to go on the open market and just keep buying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2194.1s	2194.1	 up all of Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2195.1s	2195.1	 The poison pill is whack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2196.1s	2196.1	 Now with this poison pill, now this poison pill, they've stopped it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2198.3s	2198.3	 Do you agree with the poison pill, Freeberg?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2199.9s	2199.9	 See, J Cal, hang on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2200.9s	2200.9	 I want to explain why that is because this is really important from a corporate governance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2203.9s	2203.9	 perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2204.9s	2204.9	 So people understand what you're saying is right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2206.7s	2206.7	 But the job of the board is to look out for the interests of all shareholders, particularly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2211.5s	2211.5	 minority shareholders, people that own a small stake in the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2214.1s	2214.1	 So if someone came along, let's say a private equity firm owned 60% of a public company,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2219.2s	2219.2	 the board can't just act in the interest of the private equity firm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2222.1s	2222.1	 They have to protect the smaller shareholders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2224.9s	2224.9	 And so their job is to say, is there upside for the smaller shareholders that their vote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2229.3s	2229.3	 should matter more?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2230.3s	2230.3	 And that's why we have a board to have that judgment debate and to decide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2234.0s	2234.0	 And I'm not arguing against you as much as I'm explaining what goes on in the lawyers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2237.7s	2237.7	 meetings with the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2239.3s	2239.3	 This is what they're telling you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2240.3s	2240.3	 I think basically your job is to look out for all shareholders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2242.9s	2242.9	 So Elon can go out and buy a bunch of shares.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2244.7s	2244.7	 But if he doesn't have 30% of the shares, the board has to represent the interest for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2248.2s	2248.2	 those 30%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2249.2s	2249.2	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2250.2s	2250.2	 That's how it works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2251.2s	2251.2	 I think I think what also works and what normally good boards will do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2256.6s	2256.6	 And I don't know whether Twitter will or will not do this, but I'm assuming these are, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2260.1s	2260.1	 know, they'll do the right thing here because we do know most of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2265.1s	2265.1	 They should probably get a fairness opinion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2266.9s	2266.9	 I'm sure Goldman is doing evaluation as we speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2271.0s	2271.0	 But again, when you factor in what's happened to this stock over the last decade and when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2277.4s	2277.4	 you factor in the market beta today, it's I think you're going to have a very hard case
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2284.3s	2284.3	 to make that there is a path to an outcome that's a lot bigger in an obvious way here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2290.6s	2290.6	 And I don't think that that's going to pass a lot of muster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2293.6s	2293.6	 And so the problem that this board will have is justifying the alternative of not taking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2299.7s	2299.7	 this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2301.4s	2301.4	 I think it's going to be harder than you think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2302.4s	2302.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2303.4s	2303.4	 And I think it's going to create an enormous amount of backlash where, you know, there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2306.6s	2306.6	 is a probably a lot of shareholders that would probably want to get out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2310.4s	2310.4	 You have to understand, like, why are Vanguard and all these guys owning Twitter?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2315.3s	2315.3	 They have to own it through these ETFs that they've created.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2318.3s	2318.3	 That's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2319.3s	2319.3	 That's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2320.3s	2320.3	 They don't necessarily have a point of view on the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2323.1s	2323.1	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2324.1s	2324.1	 I agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2325.1s	2325.1	 And so, you know, they're out to just basically so when you really boil it down, how many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2329.2s	2329.2	 concerned interested shareholders are there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2331.7s	2331.7	 Well, he's, Elon is clearly the largest there, you know, and then after that, it's probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2337.7s	2337.7	 only 30 or 40 percent of the total outstanding equity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2340.5s	2340.5	 I bet Jack has a really I bet Jack has the linchpin and what's going to happen here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2343.9s	2343.9	 You know, his point of view on this transaction and whether or not Elon should be the steward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2347.9s	2347.9	 of this business going forward and whether this is a fair price for him is going to sway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2352.0s	2352.0	 a big part of how this process is going to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2354.4s	2354.4	 Jack owns 2 percent, Elon owns over 9 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2356.7s	2356.7	 Yeah, but my point my point is, I think Jack's going to be a big opinion center in that board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2360.4s	2360.4	 discussion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2361.4s	2361.4	 And they're I think they're simpatico and they're friendly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2363.7s	2363.7	 So just to give you guys a number to react to here, 2021 revenue is five billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2368.7s	2368.7	 They have eight thousand employees back of the envelope, six hundred twenty five thousand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2372.2s	2372.2	 dollars per employee in revenue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2374.3s	2374.3	 Just looking at Google, which is the greatest business ever created, perhaps in terms of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2377.7s	2377.7	 efficiency as we've talked about, they have one hundred thirty five thousand employees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2381.4s	2381.4	 revenue is two hundred fifty seven billion, which puts them at two close to two billion,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2386.8s	2386.8	 two million per employee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2388.9s	2388.9	 How many people sacks on an operational basis does this business actually need to run efficiently?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2395.4s	2395.4	 Eight thousand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2396.9s	2396.9	 Yeah, you could fire half those people or more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2399.3s	2399.3	 There'd be absolutely no impact to the business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2400.8s	2400.8	 In fact, they probably run better because right now they probably got too many meetings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2404.5s	2404.5	 happening with too many people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2405.4s	2405.4	 We all know this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2406.2s	2406.2	 That company culturally has been broken for a long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2408.4s	2408.4	 When someone comes to you and says, you're my guy, you did Yammer, you're in charge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2412.4s	2412.4	 Would you run it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2413.1s	2413.1	 Would you take this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2413.7s	2413.7	 No, of course you would.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2414.7s	2414.7	 Of course you take it out, guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2416.2s	2416.2	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2416.6s	2416.6	 No, wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2417.3s	2417.3	 You take the job for 10 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2418.6s	2418.6	 I wouldn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2419.3s	2419.3	 You're a liar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2420.1s	2420.1	 Would you take the job for 10 percent?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2421.7s	2421.7	 No, I'm done operating companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2423.7s	2423.7	 I'm sick of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2424.3s	2424.3	 What if what if your funds got I don't like doing real work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2428.3s	2428.3	 Wait, hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2429.0s	2429.0	 Hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2429.4s	2429.4	 I think I think I think this is time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2431.3s	2431.3	 I think this is time where we where we can share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2434.7s	2434.7	 I'm too old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2435.3s	2435.3	 I think it was six years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2436.9s	2436.9	 Five years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2437.8s	2437.8	 I did approach Twitter with another large investor, but it was more of a friendly activist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2444.2s	2444.2	 thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2444.5s	2444.5	 And David was our nominated CEO to move that place apart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2448.5s	2448.5	 Breaking news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2449.6s	2449.6	 Must credit all in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2450.9s	2450.9	 But now after that meeting, which was a little heated, their VP of engineering and CTO quit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2456.1s	2456.1	 the next day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2456.6s	2456.6	 I remember.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2457.1s	2457.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2457.2s	2457.2	 That was funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2458.9s	2458.9	 Just at the concept of reporting it to Saks, they quit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2462.5s	2462.5	 They rage quit at the last ability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2464.2s	2464.2	 We all have made this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2465.4s	2465.4	 The Storps are like the NBA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2466.7s	2466.7	 I mean, you get to a certain age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2468.2s	2468.2	 You're just you're too old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2469.7s	2469.7	 I mean, you're the coach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2471.6s	2471.6	 You'd be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2471.9s	2471.9	 I'm done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2472.6s	2472.6	 Guys, I'm flattering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2474.1s	2474.1	 It's flattering, but I'm done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2475.2s	2475.2	 I'm done operating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2476.0s	2476.0	 I'm so sick of all that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2476.9s	2476.9	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2477.2s	2477.2	 Who do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2479.2s	2479.2	 I go on Zoom calls a couple of times a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2481.2s	2481.2	 It's a great life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2482.0s	2482.0	 Saks, you can't run it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2483.1s	2483.1	 He's got a lot going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2483.8s	2483.8	 Who do you think should be the actual CEO of the day to day CEO there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2486.9s	2486.9	 Well, I think Elon would figure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2489.1s	2489.1	 I think he would go in and figure it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2490.6s	2490.6	 I mean, he is obviously an extremely competent operator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2494.9s	2494.9	 Well, he's got a lot of people he can probably plug in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2497.7s	2497.7	 My understanding of the way that things work at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2500.1s	2500.1	 With J.K.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2500.7s	2500.7	 Tesla and.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2501.3s	2501.3	 J.K.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2501.7s	2501.7	 I'm starting a new job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2503.1s	2503.1	 SpaceX is he's got some terrific young talent who he appoints to these sort of project manager
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2508.9s	2508.9	 or product manager positions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2511.3s	2511.3	 He's got like 20 of them reporting to him and they run
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2513.5s	2513.5	 the company doing a whole sequence of projects in parallel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2516.8s	2516.8	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2517.4s	2517.4	 So he has like a bench, a deep like Elon is the new GE.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2521.3s	2521.3	 Back when when GE went all the talent to go there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2524.2s	2524.2	 Elon's got so much incredible talent on his bench.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2526.5s	2526.5	 He could parachute in some amazing operators there and clean up that place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2529.7s	2529.7	 Let me tell you something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2530.2s	2530.2	 It'd be incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2531.1s	2531.1	 The AI team on that self-driving team, which I've met and I've seen their work like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2535.3s	2535.3	 you know, in private and it's so impressive that if he took one of the AI people working on self-driving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2542.3s	2542.3	 and dropped them into Twitter, one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2544.8s	2544.8	 They would solve the bot problem, the spam problem in 30 days with one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2549.4s	2549.4	 And if God forbid he sent three, they would solve it in the weekend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2552.9s	2552.9	 The fact that they can't solve spam and bots and other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2557.3s	2557.3	 Meshuggah going on at that company is crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2560.2s	2560.2	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2560.6s	2560.6	 He would fix that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2561.4s	2561.4	 By the way, there would be less sort of there would be less problematic content on that site
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2568.1s	2568.1	 with Elon running it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2569.1s	2569.1	 Why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2569.3s	2569.3	 Yes, there'd be less harassment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2570.7s	2570.7	 There'd be less harassment because he'd get rid of all the bots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2572.5s	2572.5	 He'd impose an authenticity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2573.9s	2573.9	 Who's doing the brigading?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2574.9s	2574.9	 It's all these bot armies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2576.3s	2576.3	 The problem is they don't want the bots to go because the only sign of life in that business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2580.3s	2580.3	 is spammers and, you know, all these fake accounts being created.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2583.7s	2583.7	 So they're just scared to take that 20% hit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2586.5s	2586.5	 But the site would be cleaner without it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2588.1s	2588.1	 But look, Jason, I really think that part of the problem with our conversation today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2591.7s	2591.7	 is that we're viewing this whole Elon versus Twitter thing purely in economic and to some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2596.7s	2596.7	 degree operational terms when really I think this is also an ideological and cultural battle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2602.7s	2602.7	 or struggle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2603.6s	2603.6	 All right, we'll go to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2604.6s	2604.6	 Let's do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2605.2s	2605.2	 And this is why it's really captured the imagination of the public there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2609.5s	2609.5	 Look, what is the if you're to sort of zoom out 30,000 foot view, the big struggle of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2615.0s	2615.0	 our time politically and culturally is populist versus elitist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2618.9s	2618.9	 Okay, that's the big battle that's happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2621.3s	2621.3	 Elon is one of the rare billionaires who is sort of anti elitist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2626.0s	2626.0	 He pokes fun at their pieties all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2628.4s	2628.4	 This is why they call him a troll.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2629.8s	2629.8	 Okay, he wants to restore free speech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2632.5s	2632.5	 Somehow the elites are now on the side of censorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2636.0s	2636.0	 Like Max Boots said, they believe that in order to protect democracy, they need more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2640.0s	2640.0	 censorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2640.4s	2640.4	 What they really mean is to protect their control over democracy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2644.3s	2644.3	 They need censorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2645.3s	2645.3	 Why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2645.8s	2645.8	 Because they're greatly outnumbered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2647.0s	2647.0	 There's more populists than elitists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2649.5s	2649.5	 So if the more democratic this country becomes, the more they are going to lose power and be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2654.1s	2654.1	 kicked out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2654.7s	2654.7	 That is why they are so fiercely resisting the restoration of Twitter as a free speech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2661.1s	2661.1	 platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2661.7s	2661.7	 It means the end of their cultural power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2663.9s	2663.9	 The Axios headline encapsulates that to a T.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2668.5s	2668.5	 I gave you guys the link, Nick, you can show it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2672.1s	2672.1	 The world's richest man, someone who used to be compared to Marvel's Iron Man, is increasingly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2678.6s	2678.6	 behaving like a movie supervillain, commanding seemingly unlimited resources with which to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2684.1s	2684.1	 finance his mischief making.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2685.7s	2685.7	 I mean, what a like, are you really?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2688.5s	2688.5	 Are you serious?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2689.3s	2689.3	 This is the same guy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2690.4s	2690.4	 That's journalism?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2691.6s	2691.6	 I mean, this is the same guy that's doing more on climate change and has been doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2695.7s	2695.7	 it 20 years ago when it wasn't popular and satellites.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2699.3s	2699.3	 But I said this before and space travel and I said this before, but I just want to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2704.5s	2704.5	 it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2705.0s	2705.0	 I think if he does get a control of Twitter and there is a strong, reliable moral force
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2713.7s	2713.7	 for free speech, I think that's actually going to be his biggest contribution to society.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2718.3s	2718.3	 Because independent of all these other things, we want sort of this political philosophy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2723.8s	2723.8	 of democracy and capitalism to roughly work together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2727.1s	2727.1	 And I think it sits on top of this fundamental idea that you can say what you think without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2733.3s	2733.3	 retribution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2734.8s	2734.8	 And it's only there you can actually seek out different opinions and try different ideas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2739.2s	2739.2	 and say things and most importantly, make mistakes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2743.3s	2743.3	 And right now we have such a high cost for making mistakes that it just shuts so many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2747.7s	2747.7	 people down and out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2749.7s	2749.7	 And if he does that, that's actually a really big deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2752.8s	2752.8	 I think global, you know what that Axios headline could have said?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2755.4s	2755.4	 Chumata could have said Elon Musk spends significant portion of his fortune to restore trust in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2761.4s	2761.4	 public square by open sourcing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2763.7s	2763.7	 No, but you can't open.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2764.9s	2764.9	 So hold on open sourcing the API and allowing transparent moderation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2771.6s	2771.6	 No, Jason, that's what he said in his head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2773.6s	2773.6	 Jason, they can't because they lose power if Elon wins and gets control of Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2778.6s	2778.6	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2778.9s	2778.9	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2779.6s	2779.6	 Look, the corporate journalists like Axios, they don't make a lot of money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2784.3s	2784.3	 What they have is some degree of status, but more importantly, they have influence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2788.5s	2788.5	 That's why they do those jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2790.5s	2790.5	 And the fact of the matter, their influence is enhanced when other people don't have the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2794.8s	2794.8	 right to speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2796.0s	2796.0	 And the reason why Elon is a supervillain in their eyes is because he's going to give
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2800.0s	2800.0	 the people their right to free speech back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2803.1s	2803.1	 That is what this is really about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2804.5s	2804.5	 And they are adamantly opposed to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2806.7s	2806.7	 Now, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, every member of the press would have defended the First
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2811.2s	2811.2	 Amendment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2811.8s	2811.8	 They saw freedom of speech, freedom of the press as synonymous and fundamental to our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2816.1s	2816.1	 Republic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2816.8s	2816.8	 Today, they don't believe that anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2818.5s	2818.5	 History has been inverted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2819.8s	2819.8	 Glenn Greenwald actually had a great paragraph about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2824.1s	2824.1	 If I could just say, I know Jason made fun of the fact that...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2825.6s	2825.6	 Yeah, we got one for Alder Greenwald.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2826.9s	2826.9	 Look, I mean, I'm a Glenn Greenwald stan on a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2829.9s	2829.9	 What he said is that somehow these elites, they somehow inverted history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2834.9s	2834.9	 So now they believe that it is not censorship that is the favorite tool of fascist tyrants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2839.8s	2839.8	 and authoritarians.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2840.9s	2840.9	 Even though every fascist and despot in history use censorship as a key means for maintaining
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2846.5s	2846.5	 power, but they instead believe that it is free speech, free discourse, and free thought
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2850.8s	2850.8	 that are the instruments of repression.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2852.8s	2852.8	 So that is what it is about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2854.1s	2854.1	 But the irony is that these elites now believe in the use of authoritarian tactics to preserve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2861.1s	2861.1	 their cultural power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2863.4s	2863.4	 That's the battle that's taking place right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2864.1s	2864.1	 I think they're conflating harassment on a platform or hearing opinions they don't like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2868.4s	2868.4	 with actual censorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2871.5s	2871.5	 There's going to be harassment, sadly, in the world, and you can build tools to mitigate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2875.5s	2875.5	 that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2876.4s	2876.4	 One of the things I don't understand, I don't know if you know this feature they added last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2880.7s	2880.7	 year or so, where you can say only your followers can reply.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2885.1s	2885.1	 All these people who are complaining about harassment, I never see any of them say my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2888.4s	2888.4	 followers can reply.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2889.7s	2889.7	 If they did, they would never have anybody reply who they didn't want to reply.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2893.5s	2893.5	 The problem would be solved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2894.9s	2894.9	 Okay, lots more to come on this topic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2898.4s	2898.4	 I want to just get five.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2899.3s	2899.3	 That was a long topic for us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2900.5s	2900.5	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2900.9s	2900.9	 Well, I mean, it is the perfect topic for us because you have freedom of speech, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2906.9s	2906.9	 have markets, you have governance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2908.5s	2908.5	 I mean, it's just everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2909.6s	2909.6	 Entrepreneurship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2910.5s	2910.5	 I just want to end with we're here 30 days from now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2914.9s	2914.9	 What is your majority case?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2916.8s	2916.8	 What is your majority probability here of what happens?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2921.5s	2921.5	 Give it a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2922.9s	2922.9	 What is the stock trading at and who's running the company in 30 days?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2927.4s	2927.4	 Sax, you're first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2928.8s	2928.8	 Here's what's going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2929.6s	2929.6	 This goes back to my tinfoil theory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2931.3s	2931.3	 I think one of two things is going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2932.9s	2932.9	 Okay, first of all, Elon is going to be thwarted by these folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2936.9s	2936.9	 He's not going to get control of this company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2938.9s	2938.9	 The vested interest in stopping him by the board, by the new CEO, and by the corporate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2945.5s	2945.5	 media and the political elites is too great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2948.9s	2948.9	 They will find a way to stop him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2950.5s	2950.5	 Okay, and one of two things is going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2953.0s	2953.0	 Either the poison pill will win and Twitter stock will be down in the dumps 30 days from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2958.6s	2958.6	 now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2959.1s	2959.1	 It'll be the same price it was when Elon started accumulating around that price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2963.0s	2963.0	 It's going to be back in the dumps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2965.0s	2965.0	 To Chamos' point, all these board members are going to be sued, justifiably so, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2969.7s	2969.7	 they did not pursue the best deal of the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2971.6s	2971.6	 Or there's one other possibility that they will find a buyer for Twitter and the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2977.6s	2977.6	 they will defeat Elon will be to find another buyer at the same or greater price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2984.4s	2984.4	 They will place Twitter in the hands of another company who they regard as culturally safer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2990.9s	2990.9	 because that company buys into the regime of censorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2995.7s	2995.7	 And it might be Disney.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2997.3s	2997.3	 It might even be Google.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=2999.1s	2999.1	 I'm telling you, I think that if Google were the company to step up, the administration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3004.9s	3004.9	 would ultimately support that deal rather than Elon getting the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3008.4s	3008.4	 And I think they would tell Lena Kahn to stand down in that instance and let it go through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3014.1s	3014.1	 We will find out, and I'm telling you, in 30 days, we will find out how rigged this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3018.5s	3018.5	 game is and how deep the corruption goes because they will do anything to stop Elon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3022.9s	3022.9	 from acquiring this company, even if it means violating their fiduciary duty or violating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3027.5s	3027.5	 antitrust law.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3028.2s	3028.2	 Okay, there you got it, Alex Jones' position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3031.0s	3031.0	 Let's go freebird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3032.9s	3032.9	 I mean, I am not at all-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3034.9s	3034.9	 What is the majority case in 30 days?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3036.8s	3036.8	 I'm not at all as conspiratorial as Sachs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3039.5s	3039.5	 I don't think that this is about-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3040.3s	3040.3	 I agree with your first part, Sachs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3042.5s	3042.5	 I think that we have a board of rational actors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3044.5s	3044.5	 I really do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3045.5s	3045.5	 I think that they're going to do what they think is in the best interest of shareholders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3048.5s	3048.5	 in terms of price per share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3050.0s	3050.0	 I think that's how they're going to operate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3051.3s	3051.3	 They're all super smart, super ethical, high integrity people on that board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3056.0s	3056.0	 Now, would I like to see Elon own and operate Twitter personally?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3059.3s	3059.3	 Yes, I would.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3060.0s	3060.0	 Why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3060.6s	3060.6	 Well, I think he's going to be a better operator and he's going to make that product better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3063.3s	3063.3	 I think he's going to make the business better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3065.1s	3065.1	 I think it's going to be-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3066.1s	3066.1	 Better product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3066.9s	3066.9	 He's going to have a much more rational view on moderation that I think has been lost over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3072.1s	3072.1	 the last couple of years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3073.0s	3073.0	 And I think he'll innovate in ways that we haven't seen in that business in many years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3076.0s	3076.0	 I'd be excited for him to own that business as a user of Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3078.5s	3078.5	 That's awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3079.5s	3079.5	 But I think the board's going to act rationally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3081.4s	3081.4	 They're going to try and find the best price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3082.5s	3082.5	 They're going to reject his offer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3084.0s	3084.0	 I don't think he's going to up the offer significantly to the point to get it done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3087.4s	3087.4	 They're going to go out and run a long strategic process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3089.7s	3089.7	 Three months from now, we're still going to be running that process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3092.0s	3092.0	 That process is not going to be done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3093.6s	3093.6	 No one's going to have a real answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3095.1s	3095.1	 Elon's going to trail off and do something else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3097.1s	3097.1	 And this whole thing will kind of fade into the sunset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3098.9s	3098.9	 And stock will be trading where in three months?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3100.9s	3100.9	 35 bucks a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3103.5s	3103.5	 37 bucks a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3104.8s	3104.8	 What is the majority case here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3106.8s	3106.8	 30 days, 90 days from now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3109.4s	3109.4	 I think the 30 days is we're kind of still be here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3113.8s	3113.8	 I don't think much is going to get figured out in the next 30 days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3117.5s	3117.5	 In the next 90 days, I don't think you're going to see a better offer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3122.2s	3122.2	 I don't think anybody wants to buy this dumpster fire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3126.4s	3126.4	 Because you have to understand this dumpster fire is twofold, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3128.9s	3128.9	 On the one hand, you have a whole user usage, bot, spam harassment problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3134.9s	3134.9	 And then you have an internal issue around culture and monetization and all of this other stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3141.1s	3141.1	 And so you have to be really prepared to step in and deal with both of these two issues in a really definitive way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3146.1s	3146.1	 I think that that I'm not sure that corporate boards and companies and CEOs have the stomach for all of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3151.7s	3151.7	 So I don't think there's a better bidder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3154.7s	3154.7	 But I think within 90 days, they're going to probably first try to reject it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3160.4s	3160.4	 I'm not sure that that's in the best fiduciary interests of shareholders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3167.3s	3167.3	 In fact, I don't think it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3169.2s	3169.2	 And I think to reject it would be more a sign of ego than a sign of logic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3176.4s	3176.4	 And then I think they are going to get sued and they're going to be embroiled in lawsuits for years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3180.0s	3180.0	 So no sale happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3181.2s	3181.2	 The stock languishes again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3183.3s	3183.3	 Stalemate disaster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3185.0s	3185.0	 Well, I think by saying it, look, I mean, if you look at the stock like a simple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3189.2s	3189.2	 stock market analyst would say whenever there's a merger announced, right, at like X price,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3193.8s	3193.8	 right, like look at Microsoft and Activision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3195.6s	3195.6	 That's a better example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3196.9s	3196.9	 You know, Microsoft announced that the stock was at like, you know, $57, $58 a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3200.5s	3200.5	 Microsoft says we're going to buy Activision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3202.5s	3202.5	 I think it was for $95 a share, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3205.7s	3205.7	 And if you notice the stock hasn't gone to 95.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3208.6s	3208.6	 Now, typically merger arbitrage, what happens is that the stock goes to $1 or $2 of the acquisition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3215.1s	3215.1	 price right away, almost immediately, or it goes to within $5 or $10 or 5 or 10%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3220.8s	3220.8	 And then it bleeds towards the M&A price as the deal gets closer to certainty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3225.6s	3225.6	 So when there's a big gap, what the market is voting is that the deal is not going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3230.5s	3230.5	 And so when you look at the gap, Microsoft Activision, it kind of says it's going to take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3234.8s	3234.8	 a long time and there's a risk that it doesn't happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3238.9s	3238.9	 Similarly, if you look at this Twitter thing, why didn't it go to 53 bucks a share?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3242.9s	3242.9	 It's because a lot of people think that the board's not going to do the right thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3245.9s	3245.9	 Agreed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3246.5s	3246.5	 The fix is in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3248.7s	3248.7	 That's so conspiratorial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3250.1s	3250.1	 Saks, do you listen to Alex Jones?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3252.6s	3252.6	 The fix is happening in plain sight, Freeberg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3255.0s	3255.0	 Chamath just said it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3256.4s	3256.4	 Why is it $54?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3259.3s	3259.3	 When a deal is going to go through, the price goes right up to like below that price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3263.1s	3263.1	 The price is well below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3264.2s	3264.2	 The reason the price isn't going up is there is no buyer who wants this asset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3267.6s	3267.6	 It's going to be years to clean it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3269.2s	3269.2	 No, no, no, no, Jason, Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3270.6s	3270.6	 I don't think there's a buyer who wants it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3272.9s	3272.9	 Even if you thought that there was another buyer that was going to come at a higher price,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3278.1s	3278.1	 the money good thing to do is for people to basically buy that equity to basically bleed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3283.4s	3283.4	 into the acquisition price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3284.6s	3284.6	 No, no, I get all that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3285.3s	3285.3	 Yeah, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3285.7s	3285.7	 And so the fact that it didn't move at all, in my opinion, is a concerted belief
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3292.0s	3292.0	 that the board is going to reject the offer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3294.6s	3294.6	 Got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3294.9s	3294.9	 Even if there was another offer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3296.7s	3296.7	 And what they didn't want to do is buy the stock at 50, have the thing all of a sudden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3301.6s	3301.6	 get announced as, you know, we're not going to take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3303.4s	3303.4	 Elon dumps the shares.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3304.9s	3304.9	 All the people that bought the stock at 50 hoping it'll go to 54 would all of a sudden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3309.6s	3309.6	 lose a lot of money because the stock would instead be at 34.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3312.4s	3312.4	 So the fact that the stock basically didn't move is essentially the market's way of voting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3317.4s	3317.4	 This is a head fake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3319.2s	3319.2	 You should take the offer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3321.0s	3321.0	 The board's not going to and the stock's going to tank back to its other its original price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3326.1s	3326.1	 My prediction is the board tries to fight it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3330.6s	3330.6	 Stock collapses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3331.7s	3331.7	 Nobody thinks it's going to get done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3333.0s	3333.0	 Elon lowers his offer and he wins it by the end of the year and gives him a lower offer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3338.1s	3338.1	 You didn't like it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3338.8s	3338.8	 Always with the optimism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3339.7s	3339.7	 Now we're going 49.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3341.0s	3341.0	 That's very Michael Corleone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3342.9s	3342.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3343.2s	3343.2	 Now the offer's 49 and it goes down $2 every quarter until you guys acquiesce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3349.7s	3349.7	 The end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3350.1s	3350.1	 It's trading at 30.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3351.3s	3351.3	 I lower my offer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3352.5s	3352.5	 Jason, if you want to just finish with this little code of the Revlon story,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3357.3s	3357.3	 it was actually kind of cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3358.9s	3358.9	 Forsman Little comes in to try to basically give a white knight bid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3362.9s	3362.9	 and what Ronald Perlman did was basically say, I'm just going to top tick every bid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Suaj_0wKV0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=60&t=3368.7s	3368.7	 He was pretty baller.
