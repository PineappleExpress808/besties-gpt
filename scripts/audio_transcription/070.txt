https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=0.0s	0.0	 All right, everybody, welcome to another episode of the All In Podcast episode number 70.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=24.4s	24.4	 We made it to 70 episodes, which is just shocking to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=29.2s	29.2	 We're recording a little bit earlier because one of our besties had to change their schedule,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=34.7s	34.7	 Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=35.7s	35.7	 And it's a crazy day to be doing this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=41.3s	41.3	 Last night, Putin decided to invade the Ukraine late Wednesday night, early into Thursday
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=48.0s	48.0	 morning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=49.4s	49.4	 Putin started a special military operation in quotes to demilitarize the Ukraine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=57.7s	57.7	 We've been watching this build up for weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=60.3s	60.3	 You're missing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=61.3s	61.3	 He said to demilitarize and denazify.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=63.8s	63.8	 And denazify.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=64.8s	64.8	 Yes, of course, because the Ukraine was filled with so many Nazis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=68.5s	68.5	 His trolling continues, I guess, just starting it off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=72.5s	72.5	 Sax, you're a big Putin fan, along with Tronch and you're the right wing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=79.0s	79.0	 So tell us how glorious is this invasion for the Republican Party?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=83.9s	83.9	 Well, it's interesting what it's...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=87.6s	87.6	 Well, that's funny, but it's also kind of sad because what you're doing right there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=93.0s	93.0	 is exactly what the whole Twittersphere is doing, which is anybody who wants to actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=98.5s	98.5	 de-escalate and defuse this war before it escalates and metastasizes and something much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=102.6s	102.6	 worse gets denounced as a Putin apologist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=105.7s	105.7	 I have no dealings in either Russia or Ukraine for that matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=113.0s	113.0	 Being cash is not lining my pockets, like many of our politicians and their families
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=116.6s	116.6	 in Washington.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=117.7s	117.7	 I have no interest except preserving the safety of the United States of America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=123.8s	123.8	 And the point is that I think Biden, the one clear elusive point that he made in his last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=129.2s	129.2	 speech, I know he's giving one today, is that the United States of America would not intervene
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=134.1s	134.1	 militarily in Ukraine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=135.9s	135.9	 We should all understand that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=137.6s	137.6	 He made it very clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=139.2s	139.2	 The troops that were being sent over there were to defend our NATO allies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=143.2s	143.2	 Ukraine is not one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=144.2s	144.2	 We do not have a treaty obligation to defend them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=146.1s	146.1	 What is happening right now is tragic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=147.9s	147.9	 Putin is the aggressor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=149.5s	149.5	 It's a humanitarian disaster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=150.9s	150.9	 I do feel bad for the people of Ukraine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=154.1s	154.1	 Our thoughts and prayers are with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=155.8s	155.8	 However, we are not going to intervene militarily in that conflict, nor should we, because we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=160.5s	160.5	 cannot risk starting World War III.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=163.5s	163.5	 It is not a vital American interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=167.2s	167.2	 Who rules the Donbass in a way that it is a vital American interest to avoid a war with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=170.4s	170.4	 Russia?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=171.4s	171.4	 And the tragedy here, the second tragedy, is that we did not do everything we could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=176.4s	176.4	 to diplomatically try and solve this problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=178.9s	178.9	 And what do I mean by that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=179.9s	179.9	 On this pod three weeks ago, I said that Ukraine was never going to be part of NATO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=184.0s	184.0	 Why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=185.0s	185.0	 Because Biden just said it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=186.0s	186.0	 We can't defend them militarily against Russia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=187.7s	187.7	 We were never going to admit them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=189.2s	189.2	 Why didn't we give up that card?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=192.5s	192.5	 We don't know for sure what would have happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=194.4s	194.4	 But if we had been willing to basically affirm that we believe in Ukraine's sovereignty,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=200.1s	200.1	 but they are not a part of NATO, that might have diffused this conflict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=203.1s	203.1	 I think we had consensus on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=204.5s	204.5	 We said, like, hey, what if I think actually I suggested what if we said a five year moratorium
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=208.7s	208.7	 on them joining or something like that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=210.3s	210.3	 Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=211.3s	211.3	 We put that out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=212.3s	212.3	 Can I just ask one question on this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=213.3s	213.3	 OK, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=214.3s	214.3	 Alex, do you not think that the US, you know, regardless of the obligations under NATO,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=223.4s	223.4	 faces a little bit of an issue on a global stage where, you know, we told this leader
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=228.8s	228.8	 back down, don't do this, and then we don't respond militarily, that that action effectively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=235.1s	235.1	 reduces America's influence and credibility when it comes to these sorts of defensive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=240.0s	240.0	 statements in this kind of global theater?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=243.3s	243.3	 And our primacy is being challenged because we laid down the law.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=247.3s	247.3	 We said this is not allowed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=248.8s	248.8	 You cannot do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=249.8s	249.8	 There's going to be repercussions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=252.0s	252.0	 And then it happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=253.0s	253.0	 And there are economic sanctions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=255.5s	255.5	 And, you know, maybe we'll talk in a second about some other potential repercussions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=258.4s	258.4	 But by not doing something militarily, we weaken ourselves and we weaken our position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=263.1s	263.1	 And it gives permission to others to take action that may be counter ultimately to kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=268.7s	268.7	 of the US interests abroad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=270.4s	270.4	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=271.4s	271.4	 So in response to that, I have to quote what Barack Obama said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=275.8s	275.8	 And we've mentioned this on our previous pod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=277.2s	277.2	 He said, the fact is that Ukraine, which is back in the Atlantic interview he gave, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=282.0s	282.0	 fact is that Ukraine, which is a non-NATO countries can be vulnerable to military domination
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=285.6s	285.6	 by Russia, no matter what we do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=287.7s	287.7	 This is an example where we have to be very clear about what our core interests are and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=291.4s	291.4	 what we are willing to go to war for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=293.0s	293.0	 The fact of the matter is none of us on this pod want to send our sons and daughters to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=298.0s	298.0	 go fight and risk their lives and die to determine who rules the Donbass or even Ukraine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=304.8s	304.8	 We sympathize with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=306.1s	306.1	 We may impose sanctions on their behalf.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=307.9s	307.9	 We may arm them militarily, but we are not willing to fight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=310.8s	310.8	 And so therefore, us trying to lay down this law to Putin was a bluff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=315.0s	315.0	 And he called our bluff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=316.6s	316.6	 And the smart thing we can do right now is not to escalate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=319.9s	319.9	 Look, we've already gone to the river.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=322.1s	322.1	 He's got, you know, we basically try to barrel and bluff him at every street.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=325.9s	325.9	 We got to the river.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=327.2s	327.2	 He has now invaded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=328.2s	328.2	 We're now in a showdown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=329.9s	329.9	 What do you want to do now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=330.9s	330.9	 You want to escalate this even more?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=332.4s	332.4	 The only way that we could make this worse is to precipitate a world war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=337.2s	337.2	 Now if our absolute priority, our absolute priority right now should be to make sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=341.3s	341.3	 that this war doesn't spread.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=343.2s	343.2	 My prediction is as of right now, it would be very unpopular to go to war or for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=348.2s	348.2	 U.S. to enter the war in a on the battlefield.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=351.6s	351.6	 I do think and I don't know if we're going to hear more about this today, but I do think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=355.4s	355.4	 that the cyber war is beginning today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=359.2s	359.2	 The United States has talked at length about having, you know, tremendous cyber capabilities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=366.6s	366.6	 And my understanding is as of this morning, a number of state websites were down in Russia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=370.8s	370.8	 and a number of, you know, Russian cyber interests were under attack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=376.6s	376.6	 And so we may see the U.S. kind of confront Russia on another battle stage, not on the,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=381.9s	381.9	 you know, on the field, on the physical field.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=384.7s	384.7	 But if over the next couple of weeks this continues or days, and I was just looking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=388.7s	388.7	 at CNN this morning and BBC and there were these images that started to come out of like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=392.9s	392.9	 you know, Ukrainian airplanes that had been downed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=397.9s	397.9	 And if you start to see images of children, you know, helpless children, buildings being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=403.1s	403.1	 bombed, bodies strewn on the street, does that not change kind of the American opinion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=408.6s	408.6	 on whether or not we should do something here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=411.0s	411.0	 And will that not kind of lead us potentially into a war that, you know, today I think we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=415.7s	415.7	 all, you know, or many people would say strategically doesn't make sense, economically doesn't make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=419.7s	419.7	 sense, you know, we're only going to lead to kind of escalation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=422.7s	422.7	 But don't you think that American opinion typically changes when imagery arises, when,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=427.5s	427.5	 you know, the sort of brutality of war?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=429.1s	429.1	 Well, I mean, that's why I block images out of some wars and we have in the past, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=433.6s	433.6	 But even today, it's like the first day and there's like these really gruesome, awful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=436.9s	436.9	 photos coming out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=438.0s	438.0	 I could see people getting sympathetic to that and starting to kind of, you know, bang
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=442.1s	442.1	 the war drums saying this is ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=444.7s	444.7	 We can't let this tyrant do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=446.2s	446.2	 It's awful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=447.2s	447.2	 It's already happening, you know, but this is why we should not conduct foreign policy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=452.2s	452.2	 by Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=453.2s	453.2	 We should not Twitterize the situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=455.6s	455.6	 This is when cooler heads need to prevail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=459.7s	459.7	 The fact of the matter is when Soviet tanks, they rolled into Hungary in 1956 or Czech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=464.4s	464.4	 Slovakia in 1968 to crush the Prague Spring or Poland in 1981 to crush solidarity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=470.3s	470.3	 We did nothing because avoiding war with the Soviet Union was more important, even though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=475.3s	475.3	 we sympathize with those people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=476.7s	476.7	 And in 2008, we've been in this situation before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=480.9s	480.9	 2008, Georgia, the Republic of Georgia, Putin invaded on behalf of these breakaway Russian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=488.9s	488.9	 sort of dissident provinces, South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=492.9s	492.9	 Why did that happen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=494.0s	494.0	 I remember back in 2008, there was a lot of talk about Georgia joining NATO and you had,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=499.3s	499.3	 you know, the Warhawk Senator John McCain go over there and declare we're all Georgians
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=503.6s	503.6	 now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=504.6s	504.6	 And so what happened?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=505.6s	505.6	 All of a sudden, these breakaway provinces, the Russified provinces, South Ossetia and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=509.4s	509.4	 Abkhazia started rebelling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=511.6s	511.6	 That gave Putin the excuse to roll in there and the tanks a year later, he left, but there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=516.4s	516.4	 was no more talk of Georgia joining NATO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=518.6s	518.6	 So and again, we, George W. Bush was president at the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=522.6s	522.6	 We did nothing militarily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=524.2s	524.2	 We just sent humanitarian assistance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=525.8s	525.8	 That was it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=526.8s	526.8	 So we've been in this situation before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=528.3s	528.3	 We should not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=529.3s	529.3	 I keep hearing in the media on cable news and on Twitter, this is historically unprecedented.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=534.3s	534.3	 We must act.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=535.3s	535.3	 No, we've been in this situation before in 2008 and all those previous times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=539.8s	539.8	 We were in this situation in 2014 when Putin invaded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=542.9s	542.9	 Let me ask you a question, Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=545.5s	545.5	 We had this concept of, hey, maybe if we said, hey, we won't admit them into NATO and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=552.5s	552.5	 do you think that if we had actually made that concession or said we're not going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=556.2s	556.2	 let them into NATO for a decade and whatever, do you think that would have changed Putin's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=559.4s	559.4	 behavior or yes or no?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=560.4s	560.4	 Well, it's honestly, it's hard to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=562.0s	562.0	 I mean, I can't prove it counterfactual.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=564.3s	564.3	 However, I think it was tragic not to try.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=567.7s	567.7	 I do think, I think it should be the goal of diplomats to try.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=571.6s	571.6	 And again, as I said on a previous pod, it was the sleeves off our vest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=575.3s	575.3	 Ukraine is not going to be a member of NATO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=577.3s	577.3	 So to give that up was basically giving them nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=581.4s	581.4	 It was almost meaningless to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=584.0s	584.0	 And instead of making that concession, what happened?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=587.2s	587.2	 Blinken came out with this statement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=588.9s	588.9	 NATO's door is open and will remain open.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=591.6s	591.6	 It was perhaps the most provocative thing he could have said in that situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=596.1s	596.1	 And they would have had to been voted in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=597.4s	597.4	 That wouldn't have happened anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=599.1s	599.1	 Let me ask you this question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=600.7s	600.7	 You've been complaining about the media and Democrats banging the drum of war and you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=606.5s	606.5	 saying they're more hawkish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=608.4s	608.4	 On the other side of the table, you have Trump came out and said that Putin's move on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=613.2s	613.2	 Ukraine is genius and the guy is very savvy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=615.4s	615.4	 And then you had Pompeo saying, I have enormous respect for him and that he's a very talented
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=620.1s	620.1	 statesman has lots of gifts and he knows how to use power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=623.9s	623.9	 We should respect that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=624.9s	624.9	 So your party, your crew is praising Putin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=629.4s	629.4	 Do you think the praising of Putin is wise in this kind of situation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=632.6s	632.6	 No, look, here's what's going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=634.9s	634.9	 First of all, the war hawks and the people beating the drums of war is happening on both
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=638.6s	638.6	 sides of the aisle and on both sets of cable news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=642.3s	642.3	 I was watching Fox last night and they were all but cheerleading for war, basically saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=647.6s	647.6	 we have to go on offense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=648.6s	648.6	 They were excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=649.6s	649.6	 I watched it too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=650.6s	650.6	 Yeah, it was crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=651.6s	651.6	 They were saying we have to go on offense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=652.6s	652.6	 What is Biden doing saying that we're not going to intervene militarily?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=655.2s	655.2	 I'm like watching these people who are acting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=658.6s	658.6	 It reminded me of Dr. Strangelove where you have Slim Pickens, the cowboy, riding the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=663.9s	663.9	 atomic bomb on the way down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=665.6s	665.6	 They were excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=666.6s	666.6	 And I'm watching the cable news and all these people are acting this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=669.8s	669.8	 And I'm like, what in the world is going on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=672.0s	672.0	 You know, it's ratings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=674.2s	674.2	 This is a big part of what I tried to point out at our prediction show at the end of last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=678.6s	678.6	 year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=679.6s	679.6	 You know, if a country is happy, if the economy is growing, if there isn't significant risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=684.7s	684.7	 of inflation, no one wants to go to war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=687.8s	687.8	 When those are not the case, there's a tendency to say we got to do something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=692.5s	692.5	 And if you don't, you're anxious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=693.5s	693.5	 And if you don't have anything to do and some conflict arises, that's a good place to kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=699.0s	699.0	 of apply your energy and your pressure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=700.4s	700.4	 Let me bring the dictator himself to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=702.9s	702.9	 Jamatha, you've been silent thus far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=705.9s	705.9	 Any thoughts on what we're seeing here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=708.0s	708.0	 I was letting the proletariat speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=710.2s	710.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=711.2s	711.2	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=712.2s	712.2	 Are you the bourgeoisie or what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=716.0s	716.0	 That sweater is very bourgeois, I have to say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=719.2s	719.2	 I mean, thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=720.2s	720.2	 I mean, Sweater Karen right now is drafting multiple emails.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=726.4s	726.4	 She's melting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=727.4s	727.4	 I think there's going to be a GoFundMe to revoke that sweater from you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=731.0s	731.0	 What is the story with that sweater?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=733.1s	733.1	 That's what Trudeau will revoke in a state of emergency to stop that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=737.4s	737.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=738.4s	738.4	 Those things, the GoFundMe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=740.2s	740.2	 I mean, this feels like we're processing this, Jamatha, so quickly that the Ukraine just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=747.3s	747.3	 on Twitter today for everybody to tell at Russia how they feel about what they're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=753.0s	753.0	 And the Ukraine, this is happening in real time, is tweeting memes now about Putin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=761.9s	761.9	 This seems almost surreal and is getting very strange in terms of how we're interpreting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=767.2s	767.2	 it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=768.2s	768.2	 I mean, is there an off ramp here or are we just going to have to deal with Putin doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=771.3s	771.3	 this every number of years?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=773.5s	773.5	 This is just going to be a year or two of conflict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=778.0s	778.0	 I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=779.0s	779.0	 But here's what's important to two points.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=782.0s	782.0	 One is the economic sanctions have begun and the economic damage to Russia has been starting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=787.0s	787.0	 to be infected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=788.0s	788.0	 I think Germany basically suspended the certification of Nord Stream 2.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=790.9s	790.9	 That has a huge economic impact on Russia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=793.5s	793.5	 I think the ruble against the dollar was off 9 or 10% this morning when I woke up here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=798.7s	798.7	 in Europe, so it's down even more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=802.3s	802.3	 Now, the interesting thing about that was that I read an article in the Wall Street
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=805.4s	805.4	 Journal, maybe Nick, you can think it's up, but this was a few years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=809.2s	809.2	 Preceding this, Russia had built massive amounts of US dollar reserves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=812.2s	812.2	 In fact, they had been depleted over the last little crisis that they went through and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=816.4s	816.4	 they had rebuilt all these dollar reserves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=818.0s	818.0	 So in some ways, it may have been the case that these guys had this plan all along and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=821.8s	821.8	 they built up their bank accounts just in case because they knew that this would happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=826.2s	826.2	 The other thing is there's a quote from H.R. McMaster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=828.7s	828.7	 He said that deterrence is a simple equation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=831.5s	831.5	 It's the product of will and capability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=834.8s	834.8	 Will times capability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=836.6s	836.6	 And so if you're going to be a deterrent on the world stage militarily, not only do you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=841.7s	841.7	 have to have an incredible military capability, you also have to have the will to go to war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=847.0s	847.0	 And I think in America, what Friedberg said is, I think if you polled a lot of people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=852.4s	852.4	 people are pretty exhausted after all of these different conflicts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=856.4s	856.4	 And so I'm not sure that the will is there to go to war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=859.0s	859.0	 And so the best off-ramp is to try to find some amount of economic pressure points and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=864.8s	864.8	 then to negotiate some sort of release valve from all of that economic pressure in return
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=870.6s	870.6	 for some normalization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=872.9s	872.9	 I think that's really the best chance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=874.5s	874.5	 I have to be honest with you, when I was thinking about the odds of this, just from a financial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=879.0s	879.0	 perspective and whether I should be doing something different or putting something on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=882.9s	882.9	 I thought that there was zero chance that this would happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=885.8s	885.8	 Hopefully I put it as close to zero as possible because I thought in 2022, it just didn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=890.5s	890.5	 seem like this could be possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=891.9s	891.9	 And here we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=893.5s	893.5	 And it seems like it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=895.7s	895.7	 I hope everybody will claim a safe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=899.6s	899.6	 But I think that Biden's going to announce some pretty crippling sanctions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=902.1s	902.1	 And I think the West is going to be very punitive financially.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=905.8s	905.8	 And that's probably off-ramp.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=907.0s	907.0	 But it depends on how long that stuff will last.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=909.3s	909.3	 Because again, like I said, I think Russia's foreign currency reserves are pretty strong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=914.5s	914.5	 going into this country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=916.3s	916.3	 Let me then pass the ball to you, Sax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=920.6s	920.6	 There's going to be a lot of people who are going to die, both Russians and Ukrainians,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=923.8s	923.8	 sadly, if this thing keeps escalating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=926.3s	926.3	 There's 190,000 Russian troops on the border or making their way into the Ukraine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=932.5s	932.5	 Is there an off-ramp here in your mind in any way?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=935.8s	935.8	 Do you think the sanctions will work?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=938.0s	938.0	 And God, the poor citizens of Russia, I mean, are they going to crack at some point?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=943.8s	943.8	 Is this going to blow back onto Putin?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=947.8s	947.8	 Because what do they seem to get out of this, I guess, is a question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=952.3s	952.3	 Do the Russian people support this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=954.2s	954.2	 And will they support it on an extended basis?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=957.0s	957.0	 Well, OK, so there's a few questions there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=960.1s	960.1	 OK, so the fact of the matter is so I think you're right that Putin has bought himself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=964.8s	964.8	 a headache here, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=965.9s	965.9	 I mean, the eastern parts of Ukraine that are ethnically Russian, the areas that Don
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=973.5s	973.5	 Bass, those people will support him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=976.1s	976.1	 But the western part of Ukraine that wants to be free, that's not ethnically Russian,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=981.3s	981.3	 that is going to be a headache for him to manage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=983.3s	983.3	 I don't think he wants this problem long term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=986.9s	986.9	 It's probably going to be more like the situation we had in Georgia in 2008.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=991.2s	991.2	 He goes in for a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=992.9s	992.9	 He institutes perhaps some sort of puppet government or some government that's more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=996.9s	996.9	 favorable to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=998.5s	998.5	 And then he gets out, probably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1000.9s	1000.9	 This is if there's no escalation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1002.8s	1002.8	 I think it's very important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1004.0s	1004.0	 I keep making this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1005.4s	1005.4	 The most important thing Biden can do is to make sure that this does not escalate militarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1010.5s	1010.5	 and that we do not get militarily involved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1012.4s	1012.4	 I think sanctions will happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1014.2s	1014.2	 I mean, that's pretty clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1015.6s	1015.6	 Probably we have to move forward with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1017.9s	1017.9	 But at the same time, will sanctions work in terms of being a strong deterrent?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1022.6s	1022.6	 No, I don't think so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1023.6s	1023.6	 There was a very good article by Neil Ferguson and Ken Griffin actually in The Wall Street
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1028.2s	1028.2	 Journal talking about what we should do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1030.1s	1030.1	 They made the point that sanctions don't usually work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1033.2s	1033.2	 However, what we should really be striving for is energy independence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1037.8s	1037.8	 So 100%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1038.8s	1038.8	 So yes, but the crazy thing is America, despite having these huge natural gas reserves, 7%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1044.9s	1044.9	 of our natural gas is coming from Russia right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1047.6s	1047.6	 So why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1048.6s	1048.6	 Because we stopped fracking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1050.0s	1050.0	 We stopped the, you know, Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1052.9s	1052.9	 And then in Europe, the situation is even worse, which is they're completely dependent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1057.2s	1057.2	 on Russian natural gas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1060.2s	1060.2	 And the UK, yeah, not France.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1062.5s	1062.5	 The op-ed made the point that we could be investing in liquefying natural gas and exporting

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1071.2s	1071.2	 Putin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1072.2s	1072.2	 That's energy independence here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1073.2s	1073.2	 The problem with energy independence is it takes too long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1075.9s	1075.9	 And we went through a massive capital under investment cycle over the last six or seven
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1079.5s	1079.5	 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1080.5s	1080.5	 And so, you know, in order to start this up, you need to have started actually putting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1084.2s	1084.2	 money in the ground six or seven years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1086.3s	1086.3	 And the problem today is if we put money into the ground now, that's not going to yield
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1090.0s	1090.0	 any sort of return on investment capital for another six or seven years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1093.3s	1093.3	 And so when you look at these natural gas companies, every single one to a name has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1097.4s	1097.4	 basically said we are not going to put any incremental capital into U.S. domestic natural
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1102.1s	1102.1	 gas or shale or even offshore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1104.4s	1104.4	 The real solution is to actually go fully alternative and to go to renewable energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1108.4s	1108.4	 because you can today, right, deploy solar vastly more aggressively in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1115.4s	1115.4	 At the end of the day, the thing that is completely abundant and has the best implications all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1119.6s	1119.6	 around is solar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1120.9s	1120.9	 And it's gotten cheaper than coal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1122.7s	1122.7	 And why are we only 3% penetrated in the United States?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1128.3s	1128.3	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1129.3s	1129.3	 We can manufacture these panels.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1130.3s	1130.3	 We can deploy them broadly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1132.3s	1132.3	 Right now, you know, we're in this situation where California is actually revisiting the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1136.5s	1136.5	 ITC credit or the net metering laws, sorry, rather, which would have huge implications
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1141.6s	1141.6	 for the California solar market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1142.8s	1142.8	 It could actually destroy that whole market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1144.8s	1144.8	 And so, you know, we have to get really organized, David, to your point, but there is a path
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1148.1s	1148.1	 to energy independence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1149.1s	1149.1	 I think it's alternative energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1150.2s	1150.2	 It's wind and solar because we can do it today and you can do it really quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1154.9s	1154.9	 And you can basically leapfrog the entire capital investment cycle that you need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1158.2s	1158.2	 do for net gas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1159.2s	1159.2	 We've already missed the training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1160.2s	1160.2	 Well, and also you could have Germany could start turning back on nuclear power plants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1163.8s	1163.8	 if they could get their citizens to pick nuclear over war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1168.4s	1168.4	 That seems like a pretty easy choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1170.4s	1170.4	 It takes too long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1171.6s	1171.6	 Well, no, no, but they recently turned theirs off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1174.8s	1174.8	 No, they've been doing it for 20 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1177.6s	1177.6	 They've been turning them off for 20 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1179.7s	1179.7	 I know they could.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1180.8s	1180.8	 That means they don't have to rebuild them, Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1182.4s	1182.4	 They could just turn them back on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1184.1s	1184.1	 It's not a light switch, Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1186.1s	1186.1	 No, but that's not how it works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1187.8s	1187.8	 It's not a light switch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1188.8s	1188.8	 I know, but it's not the same as building a new one in the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1191.7s	1191.7	 That's the point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1192.7s	1192.7	 They could put them back on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1193.7s	1193.7	 It's still years to turn these things back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1195.7s	1195.7	 But the threat of doing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1197.5s	1197.5	 But you got to think, Chamath, the threat of doing it would terrorize the Saudis and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1203.2s	1203.2	 the Russians if all of a sudden the EU said we are going to go massive solar, massive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1208.4s	1208.4	 nuclear, and we're going to be energy independent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1210.4s	1210.4	 Just the threat of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1211.4s	1211.4	 I'm not sure any country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1212.4s	1212.4	 I think it would have a dramatic effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1214.8s	1214.8	 I'm not sure any country is going to really have a massive reaction to any other country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1220.0s	1220.0	 talking about a multi-year investment cycle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1222.3s	1222.3	 I do think, Jason, to your point, solar is not a multi-year investment cycle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1225.8s	1225.8	 It can literally happen in bucks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1228.2s	1228.2	 That is much more disruptive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1229.7s	1229.7	 So, for example, if you took $3 trillion of build back better and instead said, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1234.0s	1234.0	 what, we're just going to actually put solar everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1236.6s	1236.6	 That would be, you take $3 trillion of solar and you put it literally everywhere in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1240.8s	1240.8	 United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1241.8s	1241.8	 I think everybody would support it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1243.2s	1243.2	 You would have domestic job creation like nobody's business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1246.6s	1246.6	 You would take so much carbon out of it there and you would have this enormous energy dependence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1251.2s	1251.2	 Well, it would give you a degree of freedom so that the next time you're pushed to war,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1255.2s	1255.2	 you can actually evaluate it under very different risk calculus than if you actually need the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1260.3s	1260.3	 energy from the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1261.3s	1261.3	 That's the point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1262.3s	1262.3	 Yeah, that's the point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1263.3s	1263.3	 And just for a fact check here, nuclear power in Germany accounted for 13.3% of German electrical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1268.6s	1268.6	 supply in 2021.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1269.6s	1269.6	 France, by the way, 70, 80%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1273.1s	1273.1	 And that was generated by six power plant, of which three were switched off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1276.2s	1276.2	 At the end of 2021, they literally just turned these off, Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1281.3s	1281.3	 And the other three.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1282.4s	1282.4	 I know, but the decision was not made yesterday, Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1285.1s	1285.1	 My point is this is a 20 year decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1287.4s	1287.4	 No, it was Fukushima that pushed them actually in the sentiment of, and they also had 70%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1293.1s	1293.1	 of their electricity on a couple of weeks come from renewable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1296.6s	1296.6	 So the Germans suddenly thought that they didn't live in a shady area and they could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1300.2s	1300.2	 get by with just solar, which was a big mistake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1303.6s	1303.6	 This turning these off Germany, if they didn't turn these off, they would have a different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1307.0s	1307.0	 approach here too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1308.0s	1308.0	 You can be sure of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1309.2s	1309.2	 So look, I'm a fan of solar, but I'll just make the point that natural gas burns from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1313.0s	1313.0	 a climate standpoint, it burns much cleaner than oil and oil burns much cleaner than coal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1318.1s	1318.1	 So natural gas is a way better than a lot of the alternatives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1321.6s	1321.6	 And the main problem with it is that when you frack, you can get the release of methane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1327.2s	1327.2	 Well that's in the ground, but in terms of the release of methane, which is a greenhouse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1331.8s	1331.8	 gas that's actually worse than CO2.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1334.4s	1334.4	 And so you can actually get methane release.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1338.2s	1338.2	 In the US we have techniques for recapture of it, whereas I don't think Russia cares
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1341.8s	1341.8	 about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1342.8s	1342.8	 So we'd be a lot better off, I think solar is part of the answer, but I don't think we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1347.3s	1347.3	 should be turning our backs on the enormous reserves of natural gas that we have here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1351.6s	1351.6	 in this country.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1379.7s	1379.7	 of countries in that bucket are close to zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1383.3s	1383.3	 You know, Saudi Arabia took Saudi Aramco public specifically so that they under kind of MBS's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1391.2s	1391.2	 strategic direction diversify away from the fossil fuel dependency of their economy and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1397.2s	1397.2	 diversify into other assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1398.2s	1398.2	 So they are going to sell down their equity interest in Saudi Aramco over time and invest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1402.6s	1402.6	 in things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1403.6s	1403.6	 They probably made their first bet and regret it with SoftBank, but they'll probably make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1407.3s	1407.3	 other bets to try and invest in kind of next gen industries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1412.2s	1412.2	 And so if you look at the money that's going from even Exxon, and there's a guy locally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1418.7s	1418.7	 here in San Francisco who ran a very significant board proxy fight to get on the board of Exxon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1425.4s	1425.4	 and he won and he's jockeying for continued and increased investment from an R&D perspective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1431.2s	1431.2	 in renewables and alternatives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1433.8s	1433.8	 And we're seeing this across the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1435.8s	1435.8	 There's going to be in the next couple of years, if not already, many of these fossil

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1446.3s	1446.3	 renewable sources of energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1448.0s	1448.0	 So I don't think that there's any enemy here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1449.5s	1449.5	 There's no evil.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1450.5s	1450.5	 Like all the folks that have been dependent on in the past are aware of the fact that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1453.1s	1453.1	 this is not where the future is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1454.8s	1454.8	 We do have to transition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1456.6s	1456.6	 So the reason I bought energy stocks in December and the reason I made this point was threefold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1461.2s	1461.2	 One is because we have, as a result of this general consensus view, under invested in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1466.7s	1466.7	 energy infrastructure and the demands that are going to come out of the ex-COVID economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1473.9s	1473.9	 growth cycle cannot be met with the current energy infrastructure and you are going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1477.5s	1477.5	 see energy prices continue to climb coupled with the fact that when war or conflict arises,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1482.2s	1482.2	 typically you see stockpiling and you see trade routes being shut down and you see energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1487.7s	1487.7	 prices climb.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1489.7s	1489.7	 And so I think generally we're in a little bit of a transitionary state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1493.3s	1493.3	 Everyone knows where the puck needs to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1495.4s	1495.4	 Everyone's headed there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1497.2s	1497.2	 But for now, I think everyone's trying to navigate how do we get through the next couple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1501.1s	1501.1	 of years and in this particular year, get through the season of uncertainty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1507.1s	1507.1	 How fast is the economy growing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1508.4s	1508.4	 How much have we actually under invested in infrastructure and how much renewables do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1511.9s	1511.9	 we have coming online?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1512.9s	1512.9	 Now, I think the right answer, if I were to be president of the world, I would immediately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1518.1s	1518.1	 deregulate nuclear and make nuclear fission reactors a mainstay of energy production here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1526.8s	1526.8	 in the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1527.8s	1527.8	 And I think that there are a number of techniques we can undertake for safer building without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1536.9s	1536.9	 all the regulatory cycles and process needed to get these things stood up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1541.3s	1541.3	 China as I've mentioned in the past is over the next 30 years committed to building.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1546.5s	1546.5	 Check this number out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1547.5s	1547.5	 I think we talked about this 140 nuclear power stations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1551.2s	1551.2	 Their estimated cost, I believe, is on the $3 billion per station range.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1556.1s	1556.1	 They are going to increase their total energy production capacity with these nuclear power
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1563.5s	1563.5	 stations on the order of 15 to 20%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1566.7s	1566.7	 So they will take coal offline as they bring those online or they will start to have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1572.0s	1572.0	 cleaner mix of energy rather than building a next-gen infrastructure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1575.6s	1575.6	 So if we as the United States intend to be an economic challenge to China this century,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1583.0s	1583.0	 if we intend to compete effectively with them, we are going to have a really hard time with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1588.3s	1588.3	 energy prices being what they are here in this country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1591.5s	1591.5	 China is already 30 to 40% cheaper than us on an industrial scale basis with their current
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1595.4s	1595.4	 energy infrastructure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1596.8s	1596.8	 When their nuclear comes online over the next decade, their prices are going to drop even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1600.7s	1600.7	 further.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1601.7s	1601.7	 Nuclear should be in the 4 to 5 cent per kilowatt hour range.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1605.4s	1605.4	 Today China is in the 7 to 8 cent per kilowatt hour range.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1610.0s	1610.0	 The US for industrial, I think, is in a 9 cent, 10 cent range, 8 to 10 cent depending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1615.6s	1615.6	 on where you look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1616.8s	1616.8	 So they are already cheaper.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1618.1s	1618.1	 They are going to get even cheaper.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1619.8s	1619.8	 So not just from what's the right transition from a security point of view, but energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1624.3s	1624.3	 is going to be so critical in this next century for us to maintain our footing as a competitor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1629.6s	1629.6	 to China, particularly as...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1632.1s	1632.1	 Think about this for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1633.4s	1633.4	 If automation is the future of manufacturing, then electricity and energy ends up being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1638.7s	1638.7	 the biggest cost driver for those systems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1641.3s	1641.3	 And if everything is on parity, everyone's got the same automation systems, whoever's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1645.1s	1645.1	 got the cheaper energy wins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1646.8s	1646.8	 And to dovetail you and Chamath's both positions, a friend of ours said, hey, you know, nobody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1652.3s	1652.3	 wants to live near nuclear power plants and they've already got the grid going there because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1658.1s	1658.1	 it has to be there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1659.1s	1659.1	 Surround the nuclear power plant with a solar farm because it's the most efficient way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1664.5s	1664.5	 So actually pairing these two things, perhaps even with some batteries, solves the entire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1669.0s	1669.0	 problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1670.0s	1670.0	 And what do we think, Sax, is the eventuality here in terms of the relationship between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1678.9s	1678.9	 Russia and China now that we've wrapped up the energy and then, you know, all of us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1684.2s	1684.2	 I think, don't want to go to war here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1686.7s	1686.7	 So I guess there's two questions here of escalation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1689.1s	1689.1	 And I'll let you pick which one you want to go for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1691.8s	1691.8	 Escalation with Taiwan or does...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1695.1s	1695.1	 If Putin is not held, if we don't hold the line here, you know, Putin picks another country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1699.8s	1699.8	 to or another region to go after in 2023, 2024.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1704.1s	1704.1	 At what point do you say we've got to hold the line?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1706.8s	1706.8	 Well, I mean, I think the line is we have existing NATO treaty obligations to protect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1712.1s	1712.1	 the members of NATO under Article 5.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1713.8s	1713.8	 We have to come to their defense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1715.3s	1715.3	 Ukraine is not one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1716.3s	1716.3	 Georgia is not one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1717.3s	1717.3	 So to me, that's the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1718.7s	1718.7	 There is our existing treaty obligations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1721.2s	1721.2	 And this is why we should not want to add some of these countries to NATO is because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1725.9s	1725.9	 it involves us in their disputes and drags us into war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1729.6s	1729.6	 You know, on Twitter, all I hear is that this is 1938 all over again and we cannot appease
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1735.3s	1735.3	 a dictator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1736.3s	1736.3	 That is one lesson of history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1738.3s	1738.3	 It's an important lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1739.5s	1739.5	 However, there are other lessons of history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1741.2s	1741.2	 And it seems to me that the situation we're in could be more like 1914, which is World
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1745.9s	1745.9	 War I. What happened in World War I?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1749.2s	1749.2	 Basically, conflicts between minor powers drag major powers into wars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1754.1s	1754.1	 And basically, Germany gave Austria the so-called blank check war guarantee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1759.9s	1759.9	 And then that led to a war with Russia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1761.9s	1761.9	 And then that dragged the, you know, Britain and France in and eventually the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1766.5s	1766.5	 So, you know, it was a case where nobody, none of these powers wanted to be in a war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1772.5s	1772.5	 with each other. And yet somehow inertia and threats and escalations and miscalculations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1778.9s	1778.9	 and folly all sort of tumbled their way into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1782.3s	1782.3	 And that, I think, may be the historical precedent here that we want to avoid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1786.3s	1786.3	 I think we need to be very careful not to let, you know, every conflict all over the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1791.7s	1791.7	 world drag us into these types of wars and disputes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1796.3s	1796.3	 Sax, do you think American primacy is coming to an end?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1799.4s	1799.4	 I hope not. But if our goal is to preserve American primacy, which I think it should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1804.0s	1804.0	 be, then we need to be smart about how we use our strength and we don't want to fritter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1809.2s	1809.2	 it away. And what have been doing for the last 20 years?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1811.5s	1811.5	 Frittering away our strength in wars we didn't need to be in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1815.4s	1815.4	 In the Middle East, we spent how many trillions on nation building there that turned out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1820.3s	1820.3	 to be a total folly and waste of money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1823.5s	1823.5	 Look at this. And we have a 30 trillion dollar national debt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1826.3s	1826.3	 If we want this century to be an American century like the last one, we need to preserve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1831.3s	1831.3	 our strength and use it wisely and not involve ourselves in every conflict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1836.8s	1836.8	 And, you know, so look, we need to protect our NATO allies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1840.3s	1840.3	 I agree with that, but we don't need to be creating disputes and involving ourselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1845.7s	1845.7	 in wars that we have no obligation to get involved in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1848.8s	1848.8	 We need energy independence and we need to deliver our balance sheet for American
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1852.7s	1852.7	 primacy. And it's possible, but it's going to require a lot of focus and sacrifice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1857.9s	1857.9	 I really think the thing that I just made up is actually really quite genius, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1861.7s	1861.7	 redirect that three trillion dollar build back better build to just pure solar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1865.5s	1865.5	 everywhere in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1867.1s	1867.1	 It would be so disruptive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1869.4s	1869.4	 I mean, it would just be so disruptive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1871.2s	1871.2	 Could you imagine free electricity for everybody?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1873.6s	1873.6	 It becomes a dividend. It's like it's UBI in a way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1876.7s	1876.7	 Everybody gets no electrical bill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1877.9s	1877.9	 I don't think it would allow people to have free electricity forever, but I do think it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1881.1s	1881.1	 would subsidize basically the deployment of energy infrastructure to every single

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1891.7s	1891.7	 political world order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1893.2s	1893.2	 Because, you know, what you guys said is so true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1895.8s	1895.8	 A lot of this stuff rests on the politics around natural resources.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1900.3s	1900.3	 Right. So, you know, today it's oil, tomorrow it's going to be some rare earth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1905.5s	1905.5	 You know, in 10 years it could be copper and lithium.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1908.4s	1908.4	 And we want to find ourselves with the ability to be clear, eyed and focused in our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1914.3s	1914.3	 response to these issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1915.4s	1915.4	 But if we need critical resources that can only come from one other place or two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1921.1s	1921.1	 other places and we don't have the engineering ingenuity to figure out how to, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1925.6s	1925.6	 know, deliver our reliance, then we're going to get dragged into not just this conflict,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1929.5s	1929.5	 but a whole bunch of other conflicts going forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1931.5s	1931.5	 I'd say yes. And we could be energy independent for free right now if we were just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1937.3s	1937.3	 to repeal some of these executive orders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1938.9s	1938.9	 I mean, we were energy independent, like a year or two ago until we banned fracking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1944.9s	1944.9	 Why do the fracking when solar is available?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1947.5s	1947.5	 It seems to me like we want to actually preserve the environment, stop global warming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1952.5s	1952.5	 So if solar is available and nuclear is available, why would you advocate for fracking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1956.8s	1956.8	 and ripping up the earth and, you know, polluting it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1959.6s	1959.6	 I'm a fan of solar. It's really just about costs and time to deployment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1963.3s	1963.3	 Got it. OK, so you see it as a bridge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1964.9s	1964.9	 Hey, maybe we do it for five years, 10 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1966.7s	1966.7	 Long term, I think solar is the answer, but I think that's a long term strategy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1970.7s	1970.7	 The other thing that is confounding is like Americans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1974.1s	1974.1	 And this is another thing. I was just watching the media and I did exactly what you did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1977.3s	1977.3	 David, as I put on Fox. I was like, let me get their interpretation of this, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1980.6s	1980.6	 the Trump folks are praising Putin and then these guys are wanting to go to war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1984.4s	1984.4	 So it feels like there's some inner conflict or some war going on in the Republican
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1988.9s	1988.9	 side of things. But even on the.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1989.9s	1989.9	 There is. Yeah. And then on the left, you have this craziness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1993.8s	1993.8	 They were, I mean, Wolf Blitzer and everybody was so excited about this war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=1998.1s	1998.1	 They were like, stay tuned. And oh, my God, we're going to be 24 hour coverage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2001.9s	2001.9	 They were like orgasmic in their coverage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2005.1s	2005.1	 Remember, CNN got their got their big start for the Gulf War.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2008.9s	2008.9	 That was it. Wolf Blitzer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2009.8s	2009.8	 That was their chance to shine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2010.8s	2010.8	 I remember being a kid watching that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2012.3s	2012.3	 That is the language, Freeburg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2014.3s	2014.3	 That was the language they were using.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2016.1s	2016.1	 So Don Lem was saying, and we have the full resources to give you blow by blow coverage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2021.3s	2021.3	 of everything happening. Stick with CNN.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2023.3s	2023.3	 This is where we do our best work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2025.5s	2025.5	 And it was literally like war porn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2027.3s	2027.3	 And it was really uncomfortable to watch combined with Saks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2030.4s	2030.4	 And this is what I wanted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2031.6s	2031.6	 Well, maybe Freeburg, I'll throw this one to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2034.4s	2034.4	 They kept talking about how Americans were going to suffer at the pump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2040.2s	2040.2	 And I just thought this is so crazy and disturbing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2042.5s	2042.5	 There's one hundred ninety thousand young Russian men who are going to die.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2046.3s	2046.3	 Countless Ukrainian civilians, civilians who are going to die potentially.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2050.6s	2050.6	 And this thing could escalate, as Saks said, you know, you can't play games with war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2054.2s	2054.2	 It could the dominoes can fall in all directions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2056.8s	2056.8	 You have no idea when you light off these grenades.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2060.0s	2060.0	 And we're talking about our pain at the pump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2063.2s	2063.2	 Very weird. Very weird times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2067.1s	2067.1	 Freeburg, any thoughts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2067.9s	2067.9	 America's weird. It's weird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2069.8s	2069.8	 I want to if Freeburg doesn't want to respond to that, I want to I want to talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2073.1s	2073.1	 with the media coverage. I'll add to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2075.0s	2075.0	 I mean, you flip over to MSNBC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2077.2s	2077.2	 John Bolton is on MSNBC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2079.7s	2079.7	 And one of the weirdest things happening in our politics now is that all the neocons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2083.7s	2083.7	 who used to be members of the Republican Party, who worked for George W.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2086.6s	2086.6	 Bush and got us into the Iraq War, have now all become Democrats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2090.5s	2090.5	 And they're all over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2091.5s	2091.5	 They're supposedly the conscience of the country over on CNN and MSNBC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2096.9s	2096.9	 and beating the drums of war. It's absolutely unbelievable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2100.0s	2100.0	 And one of the the one of the tactics they use that I think we should talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2105.3s	2105.3	 is and this goes all the way back to the Vietnam War, is that anybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2109.1s	2109.1	 who merely tries to, let's say, understand the other side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2112.6s	2112.6	 or wants to deescalate or get out of a conflict, they try to portray as unpatriotic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2118.1s	2118.1	 I mean, this again, this goes all the way back to the Vietnam War, where the Vietnam
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2120.9s	2120.9	 protesters were portrayed as un-American and unpatriotic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2124.1s	2124.1	 Well, it turns out they were right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2125.3s	2125.3	 That was a mistake for us to get embroiled in Vietnam.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2128.4s	2128.4	 And similarly, the Iraq War, it turns out that was a gigantic mistake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2132.0s	2132.0	 But in 2003, David Frum, who's like one of the leaders of this group,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2135.5s	2135.5	 wrote an article called Unpatriotic Conservatives, in which he attacked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2139.8s	2139.8	 and sort of maumau the there were, you know, conservatives like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2143.3s	2143.3	 Pap Ucant and Robert Novak who were against the Iraq War.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2146.7s	2146.7	 And he called them unpatriotic and implied that they were un-American
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2150.8s	2150.8	 and somehow in the pocket of Saddam Hussein
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2153.5s	2153.5	 because they were against us, our involvement in the Iraq War.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2155.9s	2155.9	 Well, they were right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2157.0s	2157.0	 They turned out to be right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2158.1s	2158.1	 And yet they were demonized and called unpatriotic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2160.9s	2160.9	 And where are we today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2161.8s	2161.8	 Those same people I'm seeing David Frum on Twitter now impugn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2166.6s	2166.6	 the patriotism of people who merely want us not to escalate this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2171.0s	2171.0	 not to get involved and maybe to try and understand our enemy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2175.1s	2175.1	 Because I mean, this is one of the problems with Twitterizing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2177.7s	2177.7	 our foreign policy is, look, we can see Putin as an aggressor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2180.9s	2180.9	 We can see him as a thug or an authoritarian or as a dictator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2184.5s	2184.5	 But nonetheless, we should still try and understand our enemy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2187.6s	2187.6	 And anybody who tries to promote a greater degree of understanding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2191.3s	2191.3	 or diplomacy gets attacked by these people as being Putin apologists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2195.8s	2195.8	 Chamath, you said you didn't see this coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2197.7s	2197.7	 You thought this is a very small probability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2199.2s	2199.2	 I think we all felt it was a pretty small probability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2201.7s	2201.7	 that Russia would actually go through this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2203.7s	2203.7	 You thought it was actually something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2205.4s	2205.4	 Actually, I do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2205.9s	2205.9	 Freiburg, you did think it was going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2207.4s	2207.4	 It's a certainty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2208.5s	2208.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2208.8s	2208.8	 Well, wait, you thought it was a certainty that America would get involved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2211.3s	2211.3	 because of the dog scenario or that Putin would do it because.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2215.5s	2215.5	 Both.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2216.1s	2216.1	 Both. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2217.2s	2217.2	 Yeah. This is not like a surprise that Putin did this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2219.7s	2219.7	 I mean, this has been a long time coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2221.4s	2221.4	 Yeah. I mean, it just felt like I thought that he would saber
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2225.2s	2225.2	 rattle and we come to some resolution here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2227.1s	2227.1	 But what does he want?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2229.1s	2229.1	 It seems like nobody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2230.5s	2230.5	 And this is what everybody keeps saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2232.1s	2232.1	 I think that's really by the way, I think that's a really complicated question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2234.8s	2234.8	 I feel like there's decades of and layers of like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2239.8s	2239.8	 to the story, it's like, you know, war and peace.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2241.9s	2241.9	 And then you read like one half of the final chapter and you're like, oh, yeah, OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2245.0s	2245.0	 Like there's a lot to the story that's going to be really hard for us to unpack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2249.7s	2249.7	 So, you know, I'm not sure there's a very simple like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2252.1s	2252.1	 what does Putin want as much as there is a significant narrative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2255.4s	2255.4	 that that that backs the history, you know, post-Soviet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2259.9s	2259.9	 history with Ukraine and the relationships.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2262.2s	2262.2	 I mean, you guys may remember that there was a president,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2265.2s	2265.2	 a presidential candidate or president that was poisoned by Putin at some point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2269.2s	2269.2	 I mean, there's been like a long history to this that I don't think is something that we can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2272.6s	2272.6	 Well, reunification is what most people would put that under.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2276.8s	2276.8	 Is this concept of economic, there are social, you know, there are individuals,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2281.1s	2281.1	 cultural motives. I mean, there's a lot driving this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2284.7s	2284.7	 There's a lot of influence within that country that I don't think we really fully grasp.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2289.2s	2289.2	 Within the country of Russia, I mean, that we don't fully grasp.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2292.3s	2292.3	 Related to some of the cultural relationships with some of the population
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2296.2s	2296.2	 in the Ukraine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2298.2s	2298.2	 And so, you know, it's a very difficult question to simply answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2301.5s	2301.5	 Can I take a shot at it? Yeah, sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2303.8s	2303.8	 OK, what does Putin want?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2304.9s	2304.9	 So I want to there's an article by Peter Beinart, who was an editor of the New Republic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2309.4s	2309.4	 He's not, you know, some far right conservative or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2312.8s	2312.8	 He published this quotes from a memo that was written by Bill Burns back in 2008.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2318.2s	2318.2	 So Bill Burns is the current DCI, the director of central intelligence, the head of the CIA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2322.9s	2322.9	 He is also a Russian expert. He speaks Russian fluently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2326.4s	2326.4	 He is the and he spent many years over there in our government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2331.5s	2331.5	 And he works for Biden. He's Biden's head of the CIA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2333.7s	2333.7	 So he is the highest ranking Russian expert in our government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2337.0s	2337.0	 In 2008, he wrote a memo to Condoleezza Rice, who was then the secretary of state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2342.2s	2342.2	 And what he said is this is about Ukrainian entry into NATO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2345.3s	2345.3	 He said, Ukrainian entry into NATO is the brightest of all red lines for the Russian elite, not just Putin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2351.8s	2351.8	 He says, in more than two and a half years of conversations with key Russian players,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2356.1s	2356.1	 from knuckle-draggers in the dark recesses of the Kremlin to Putin's sharpest liberal critics,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2360.7s	2360.7	 I've yet to find anyone who views Ukraine and NATO as anything other than a direct challenge to Russian interests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2368.6s	2368.6	 So Burns pointed out to the then secretary of state that this was a huge red line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2375.4s	2375.4	 And since then, since 2008, Putin has been very consistent that Ukrainian entry into NATO has been a red line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2382.6s	2382.6	 And even in the speech that he gave last week, he talked about he talked about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2388.3s	2388.3	 And he said that I'm quoting Putin from his speech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2391.5s	2391.5	 He says, if Ukraine was to join NATO, it would serve as a direct threat to the security of Russia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2397.7s	2397.7	 So, you know, in response to Putin's speech and on Twitter, I keep hearing that Putin is this madman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2403.5s	2403.5	 We can't understand what he wants, that the only possible explanation for his behavior is either senility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2410.4s	2410.4	 He's gone crazy. He's gone mad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2412.8s	2412.8	 And, you know, I'm looking at this and I'm like, OK, maybe those things are true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2416.7s	2416.7	 But you can't say that he hasn't been clear about what his red lines are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2421.3s	2421.3	 He's been saying this for 20 years, that Ukraine joining the NATO alliance is an absolute red line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2427.3s	2427.3	 And, you know, I mentioned before on this pod that imagine if the Cold War is still going on and the Warsaw Pact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2433.1s	2433.1	 still existed and, you know, Justin Trudeau was going to lead Canada into the Warsaw Pact,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2439.1s	2439.1	 we would absolutely be up in arms about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2441.1s	2441.1	 We would not let that happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2443.0s	2443.0	 It is that kind of issue for Putin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2445.9s	2445.9	 And we just act like this guy is insane, has no point of view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2450.7s	2450.7	 I'm not we don't have to believe he's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2452.8s	2452.8	 But to basically say that he has no interest in Russian security that we need to give any weight to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2461.6s	2461.6	 that we just need to dismiss all of his concerns out of hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2465.5s	2465.5	 It just, you know, this is not the history of the situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2468.7s	2468.7	 Yeah. Did you read anybody read Madeleine Albright's New York Times piece?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2473.0s	2473.0	 It was pretty interesting because she was in the position when they first met him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2477.7s	2477.7	 And he's been talking about the Ukraine and reunification for 20 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2482.1s	2482.1	 And it's probably a good lesson for the entire planet that dictators are going to, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2488.7s	2488.7	 they have a certain, to your point, your mouth of like having will and capabilities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2493.8s	2493.8	 A lot of people have capabilities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2495.1s	2495.1	 A lot of people don't have will to start wars anymore on this planet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2497.7s	2497.7	 And he clearly is in that group, I think as hard as it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2501.2s	2501.2	 But Jason, we don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2502.6s	2502.6	 Here's the thing. By not taking NATO off the table is an issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2506.6s	2506.6	 We don't know whether his true aim here is the restoration of the Russian empire or merely to avoid,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2514.3s	2514.3	 you know, this border country being part of a military alliance that he views as a threat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2519.2s	2519.2	 So I don't know what the answer is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2520.7s	2520.7	 Or part or door number three.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2522.5s	2522.5	 He wants more attention. He wants to be more globally relevant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2525.1s	2525.1	 Right. But we made the mistake of not taking this issue off the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2528.9s	2528.9	 And so if we had taken the issue off the table, then we could get to the real heart of the issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2533.4s	2533.4	 Maybe it would have diffused the situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2535.2s	2535.2	 Or if the EU and NATO had done it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2537.0s	2537.0	 Right. It's not just us in this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2538.2s	2538.2	 Like the people in Europe have a big say here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2540.2s	2540.2	 As we're discussing this on a on a Thursday, February 24th,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2544.9s	2544.9	 Biden has announced a coalition of partners, EU or Australia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2548.4s	2548.4	 Others are doing pretty significant sanctions, it seems,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2554.2s	2554.2	 limiting Russia's ability to do business in dollars, euros and yen, imposing major sanctions on the Russian banks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2559.7s	2559.7	 trying to cripple the ruble, blocking for major Russian banks, freezing all of their assets in America,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2565.1s	2565.1	 adding sanctions to Russian elites.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2566.9s	2566.9	 I guess that's the oligarch class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2569.5s	2569.5	 And Russia's largest state-owned enterprises will no longer be able to raise money from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2576.0s	2576.0	 Coalition of governments, Biden assumes this will degrade their military advancement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2580.1s	2580.1	 And I have a funny Russian story to tell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2582.5s	2582.5	 So when I was when I was still running, when I was managing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2587.2s	2587.2	 not just my money, but other people's money and I was raising funds, eventually, you know, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2593.3s	2593.3	 you get LP commitments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2596.3s	2596.3	 from all kinds of people interested in investing with you if you're generating great returns, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2600.2s	2600.2	 Meaning, you know, rich family offices all around the world want to give you capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2604.3s	2604.3	 And there's a very strict process in America where when you get capital in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2608.6s	2608.6	 you have to make sure that those folks basically pass,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2613.0s	2613.0	 you know, an anti-money laundering check and a know your customer kind of check.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2616.7s	2616.7	 KYC checks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2618.5s	2618.5	 And one of these checks is actually a gray list and a blacklist that Treasury and the DOJ kind of manage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2625.6s	2625.6	 And every now and then they'll put people on or off the list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2628.3s	2628.3	 And there's a very famous person in Russia, who I will not say, when I was raising money for my last fund,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2635.1s	2635.1	 this was probably in 2014 or 15, he was on the he was not on the list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2640.3s	2640.3	 You know, very well known person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2642.3s	2642.3	 And I thought, wow, this is a great opportunity to get somebody who seems to be doing a lot of really interesting, good work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2647.5s	2647.5	 And not less than two or three weeks after we had signed our LP agreement, I think it was DOJ or Treasury.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2654.4s	2654.4	 Put them on this list and we get a we get a you know, an email basically saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2658.5s	2658.5	 hey, tear up the LPA and you can't take the capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2662.2s	2662.2	 And we had to undo the entire limited partner agreement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2667.1s	2667.1	 Crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2667.9s	2667.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2668.5s	2668.5	 What percentage of the fund would that person have been, Volpar?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2671.4s	2671.4	 I don't remember, but he was he's a significant person investing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2676.3s	2676.3	 Five, 10% or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2677.5s	2677.5	 So I guess, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2678.8s	2678.8	 Hey, Jason, I just want to going back on a point I made about energy and energy independence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2683.7s	2683.7	 Earlier, because I actually pulled up the numbers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2685.9s	2685.9	 So, you know, the average cost per kilowatt hour in the.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2693.5s	2693.5	 In China right now is about nine cents for for energy production.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2699.1s	2699.1	 It is estimated that nuclear power production should drop to about four cents,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2705.0s	2705.0	 but could be as low as one cent per kilowatt hour if operated at scale with perfect efficiency,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2710.2s	2710.2	 just to give everyone a sense of where not just security risk and kind of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2714.7s	2714.7	 you know, the green opportunity lies, but also where economic advantage lies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2719.7s	2719.7	 in investing in nuclear infrastructure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2721.5s	2721.5	 And so as China builds out 140 nuclear plants here over the next two to three decades,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2725.9s	2725.9	 they are going to see their energy cost decline from about nine cents for industrial use,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2730.7s	2730.7	 potentially, you know, into the sub five cent per kilowatt hour range,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2734.9s	2734.9	 which makes them tremendously competitive on a manufacturing point of view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2738.5s	2738.5	 It's a lot of Bitcoin servers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2739.8s	2739.8	 That's a lot of hash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2741.5s	2741.5	 I think it's never going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2743.7s	2743.7	 I'm not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2744.4s	2744.4	 I love nuclear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2745.5s	2745.5	 You think what's not going to happen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2747.0s	2747.0	 Nuclear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2747.5s	2747.5	 I think America's America's ability to scale nuclear, I think, is a very difficult proposition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2752.6s	2752.6	 And I think our real solution is solar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2754.5s	2754.5	 Is solar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2755.1s	2755.1	 It's practical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2755.8s	2755.8	 It can be done today and it can be done right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2758.2s	2758.2	 And just to look at the EU versus the US in terms of gas mileage, which is just stunning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2765.1s	2765.1	 The EU has mandated America doesn't have to resolve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2770.3s	2770.3	 It's like it's like we have to we have to cross so many bridges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2774.1s	2774.1	 And, you know, we have to really confront a bunch of issues that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2778.3s	2778.3	 that have been riddled with so much inaccuracy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2781.3s	2781.3	 You know, for example, the environmental impact, the understanding of how nuclear energy works,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2786.3s	2786.3	 you know, the NIMBY is adjacent that you referred to about not being able to build these things all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2790.3s	2790.3	 around the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2791.5s	2791.5	 And so reducing the form factor, in my opinion, is a technical challenge that I think we can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2795.5s	2795.5	 overcome, but it still leaves the policy and the societal level challenges that I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2800.8s	2800.8	 are very difficult to overcome, because you're talking about rewriting history in many ways and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2805.5s	2805.5	 and convincing, you know, hundreds of millions of people that things that they had thought
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2809.2s	2809.2	 were true were no longer true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2810.4s	2810.4	 And I think that's much, much harder than we give it credit for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2813.6s	2813.6	 And cars is a perfect example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2815.1s	2815.1	 Americans now we're averaging 24 miles to the gallon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2817.7s	2817.7	 The EU is mandated 57 miles per gallon in 2021.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2822.1s	2822.1	 They're getting it done in the EU.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2823.9s	2823.9	 They're twice as effective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2825.1s	2825.1	 I tweeted, hey, listen, Americans, we need to buy better gas mileage cars and move to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2829.9s	2829.9	 EVs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2830.3s	2830.3	 And I was faced with quite a backlash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2833.1s	2833.1	 I mean, it was insane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2834.7s	2834.7	 That's not entirely true, because California did pass their own legislation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2838.1s	2838.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2838.3s	2838.3	 And there was this issue because the car companies pushed back and said, you know, it's too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2841.5s	2841.5	 expensive for us to build two different skews, one for California and one for the rest of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2845.4s	2845.4	 America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2846.7s	2846.7	 They're already building one for the EU.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2848.5s	2848.5	 Just to give you one counterpoint to your statement about energy independence arising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2852.6s	2852.6	 potentially from solar to generate a gigawatt of capacity and industrial scale solar farm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2857.7s	2857.7	 would take about 7,500 acres.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2860.8s	2860.8	 You know, so that's about 30.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2862.3s	2862.3	 I don't think that's how it's I don't think that's how it's done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2864.5s	2864.5	 I think a very simple solar installation and everybody's home with a simple battery is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2869.4s	2869.4	 more than enough to basically give people the power they need.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2872.3s	2872.3	 And then these big CNI installations of happening on top of all these big buildings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2876.7s	2876.7	 will cover the rest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2877.5s	2877.5	 And I think that you'll still have some amount of net gas peakers usage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2881.6s	2881.6	 And maybe you can have some amount of solar or hydro or wind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2885.7s	2885.7	 But people are experimenting and figuring out the battery storage capability to supplement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2890.3s	2890.3	 this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2890.6s	2890.6	 I think what we don't have is that at 3% residue solar, we don't have a credible alternative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2895.6s	2895.6	 But, you know, 80% residue solar with battery systems in everybody's home, which is a track
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2902.2s	2902.2	 double solution that costs thousands of dollars per home, which the government could subsidize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2907.0s	2907.0	 would be a great use of capital, I think would be transformational for energy, it would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2910.7s	2910.7	 completely rewrite the energy calculus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2912.7s	2912.7	 So again, to do that today would cost because when you do something on a residential roof,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2918.2s	2918.2	 it costs a lot more than doing it on an industrial scale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2920.3s	2920.3	 So when you build out a 7,500 acre solar facility, you get economies of scale, you get single
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2925.2s	2925.2	 tubes, everything can run off one wire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2926.8s	2926.8	 When you build it on a roof, you need contractors to come in, you got to wire the home, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2930.4s	2930.4	 got to put batteries in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2931.7s	2931.7	 So the actual amortized cost over the lifetime of that solar installation works out to something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2936.3s	2936.3	 on the order of 15 cents a kilowatt hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2938.4s	2938.4	 Whereas if you do it on an industrial scale, it works out to about three cents a kilowatt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2941.5s	2941.5	 hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2942.2s	2942.2	 So, you know, your point makes sense, but it makes things more expensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2946.1s	2946.1	 So then the question is, who's going to fund the delta?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2948.4s	2948.4	 And is someone actually going to pay for that delta to make this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2952.0s	2952.0	 I'm sure over the next few years, we're going to spend trillions and trillions of dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2955.4s	2955.4	 on nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2956.7s	2956.7	 Those trillions and trillions of dollars could probably whatever your gap is, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2960.3s	2960.3	 know whether your math is right or wrong, but whatever the gap is that gets us to China,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2964.1s	2964.1	 as an example, in terms of the cost per kilowatt hour, the government could substance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2968.8s	2968.8	 And there is a quantifiable number.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2970.7s	2970.7	 And if we had, if we decided whether it was worth it or not, we could decide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2974.7s	2974.7	 But all I'm saying is it's something that we need to put on the table because every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2978.9s	2978.9	 time a new president comes into town and gets elected, they generally get this one big shot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2984.9s	2984.9	 on goal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2985.7s	2985.7	 You know, the last few presidents have tried to either, you know, cut taxes or basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2989.7s	2989.7	 give these massive economic stimulus packages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2993.9s	2993.9	 And the net dollar effect of these things is now measured in trillions of dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=2997.7s	2997.7	 And I suspect that the net, you know, cost of subsidizing enough solar energy that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3002.2s	3002.2	 get a broadly deployed is also in the trillions of dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3004.3s	3004.3	 And we should just decide whether that is in a better use of the money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3006.7s	3006.7	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3007.0s	3007.0	 Just to do some quick math here to booster Trimalt's point, he almost nailed it exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3013.5s	3013.5	 There are 85 million standalone homes in the U.S., Chauvin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3017.6s	3017.6	 I'm just going to assume none of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3019.7s	3019.7	 For the sake of this argument, have solar on them, but 3% do, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3024.1s	3024.1	 Average cost of putting solar on homes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3027.0s	3027.0	 20 to 35,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3028.4s	3028.4	 I picked the number 30,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3029.9s	3029.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3031.1s	3031.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3031.3s	3031.3	 Hold on a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3032.3s	3032.3	 But in Australia, it costs 5,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3034.3s	3034.3	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3034.6s	3034.6	 They have a cheaper system or something?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3036.1s	3036.1	 No, it's because of all the nonsense that exists in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3038.9s	3038.9	 Subsidized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3039.4s	3039.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3040.0s	3040.0	 So but just to give the raw cost here, if it was $30,000 to put on 85 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3045.1s	3045.1	 You can do it for $5,000 a home because Australia would just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3050.1s	3050.1	 the size of America is able to do it with no subsidies direct to the consumer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3054.4s	3054.4	 for $5,000 in installation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3056.5s	3056.5	 So that price is possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3057.9s	3057.9	 I'm going to pick the $30,000 crazy price in America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3061.5s	3061.5	 $2.5 trillion to put solar on every home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3064.6s	3064.6	 The end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3066.0s	3066.0	 Like we're $30 trillion in debt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3069.6s	3069.6	 10% of our debt would make us energy independent forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3073.5s	3073.5	 The plan gets better when you do math.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3075.4s	3075.4	 Sorry, and think of the amount of savings you do to the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3080.2s	3080.2	 Think of the lack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3080.9s	3080.9	 I don't know if you saw this, but there was a UN report about the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3083.4s	3083.4	 criticality and importance of emerging wildfire threats to our ecosystem and our ecology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3089.7s	3089.7	 For all of us that lived in California, do you guys remember how the sky was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3093.0s	3093.0	 orange and red two years ago or those crazy pictures from Los Angeles?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3097.2s	3097.2	 So if you have less of a reliance on these aging utilities and these utilities infrastructure,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3103.0s	3103.0	 there'll be less forest fires.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3104.8s	3104.8	 The air will be cleaner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3106.9s	3106.9	 People will be more resilient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3108.2s	3108.2	 Think of the times that, for example, in Texas, where there was that massive freeze,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3112.4s	3112.4	 where people were shut out of, they couldn't have power because the actual
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3115.8s	3115.8	 traditional utilities were shut down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3118.0s	3118.0	 If it's only $2.5 trillion, I think we should have done this yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3121.1s	3121.1	 I can't believe the number is that low actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3123.7s	3123.7	 Considering the things that when we put $2.5 trillion price tags on things and spend it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3127.4s	3127.4	 The cost of upgrading, I'm just pulling some numbers here off of the internet, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3133.0s	3133.0	 replacing our electrical grid would be $5 trillion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3136.7s	3136.7	 So if you think about the replacement cost of the actual grid, which we're going to have to do at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3140.1s	3140.1	 some point, and the upgrade cost of $500 billion a year, or the maintenance of $500 billion a year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3145.1s	3145.1	 this actually starts to seem very reasonable and achievable if we had the will, which means we need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3150.5s	3150.5	 to have some politicians who actually aren't in the pocket of big oil.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3154.3s	3154.3	 The number of jobs that Biden would create if he actually ran with this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3158.4s	3158.4	 and because you do need a lot of local installation capability and other jobs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3163.7s	3163.7	 you would create hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of jobs in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3167.9s	3167.9	 They would be really well paying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3171.0s	3171.0	 You would be pushing us towards a completely energy independent clean energy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3175.9s	3175.9	 zero carbon future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3177.3s	3177.3	 That'd be transformation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3178.3s	3178.3	 Yeah. I wonder how many hours of work it is to install.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3181.7s	3181.7	 You could actually do that math as well and figure out how many jobs you create,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3184.9s	3184.9	 and then how much tax those people pay, and then how much they spend of that money to put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3191.1s	3191.1	 back into the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3192.3s	3192.3	 You're probably getting a 30, 40% rebate on that $2.5 trillion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3195.8s	3195.8	 So it becomes even better because of the high paying jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3199.5s	3199.5	 The markets are tanking, obviously, over the last couple of months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3205.6s	3205.6	 Dow is down 11% year to date.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3209.3s	3209.3	 Of course, a lot of the growth socks, we've talked about this over and over again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3212.3s	3212.3	 from Zoom to Netflix, Facebook, Spotify, Coinbase, Twilio, all down over 50%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3218.3s	3218.3	 Today, the market went down 5%, 6% on the news and then rebounded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3223.9s	3223.9	 Is this all priced in and is this the bottom of the market?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3228.2s	3228.2	 Cathie Wood is supposedly buying, and I don't know if it's net buying or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3234.2s	3234.2	 she's just reallocating, but are we now in the bargain hunting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3238.7s	3238.7	 period of the market and we've bottomed out?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3241.1s	3241.1	 The smart folks that I talk to, who I really look up to and respect, think that the bottom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3248.3s	3248.3	 in the S&P is around $3,800 and that what we still need to do is one last flush,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3255.1s	3255.1	 and that last flush will really touch the big cap companies, but that growth is largely done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3265.1s	3265.1	 sort of getting taken to the woodshed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3266.8s	3266.8	 In general, I think that generally buyers have broke down, sellers have value, and waiting for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3275.2s	3275.2	 this one last 400 point move down the S&P, and I think people think it's roughly the bottom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3280.3s	3280.3	 Now, if there's a world war, obviously, who knows all that's wrong, but yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3285.1s	3285.1	 So, Sax, what's more shocking that we're almost at the bottom or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3287.9s	3287.9	 there's people in the markets that Tramath really respects?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3290.9s	3290.9	 Which is well, speaking of people that we respect, so I think Brad Gerstner has a really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3296.8s	3296.8	 interesting take on this, which is that- Sorry, I should also be clear that I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3300.2s	3300.2	 recruiting this one person who I really respect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3302.1s	3302.1	 Okay, so they're both.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3305.8s	3305.8	 So, Brad Gerstner has published a couple of charts showing basically multiples in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3311.5s	3311.5	 internet index and among SaaS companies over the last whatever dozen years or so,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3316.1s	3316.1	 and what you can see is that over the last two years during COVID, there was a huge spike in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3321.1s	3321.1	 multiples for internet companies and for SaaS companies, and that over the last, really since
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3326.3s	3326.3	 November, the last three, four months, has now come down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3329.9s	3329.9	 And as of I would say last week, it was right at about the historical trend and now it's starting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3335.5s	3335.5	 to go under the historical trends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3337.8s	3337.8	 So, from a bargain hunting standpoint, you'd have to say that this is the first time that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3343.1s	3343.1	 we've been below the average for a few years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3348.1s	3348.1	 Now, that's not to say it can't go down even more because in the same way that you can be above
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3352.5s	3352.5	 trend, you can also be below trend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3354.4s	3354.4	 And if this war escalates and metastasizes, it will go down more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3358.7s	3358.7	 But if this conflict can stay localized and the economy doesn't go into a recession because of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3365.2s	3365.2	 everything that's happened, then yes, this might be bargain hunting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3369.0s	3369.0	 Here's the chart for everybody to take a look at from January 20 to January 22, the two years of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3375.4s	3375.4	 the pandemic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3376.4s	3376.4	 And I think this is times forward-looking sales.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3378.9s	3378.9	 If I'm reading it correct, I don't have the full chart here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3381.3s	3381.3	 I just have a screenshot of it, a portion of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3383.8s	3383.8	 Yeah, I think it's enterprise value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3385.5s	3385.5	 Yeah, it's enterprise value divided by like forward-looking revenue, which is you kind of say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3391.1s	3391.1	 is like ARR.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3392.2s	3392.2	 Yeah, it's sort of like ARR.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3393.5s	3393.5	 It's like recurring revenue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3395.5s	3395.5	 And so, yeah, we had this 15X, we went up to 40, 50X, private market deals going at 100, 200X.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3403.1s	3403.1	 Those days are over big time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3405.9s	3405.9	 And we've talked about that ad nauseum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3408.2s	3408.2	 One of the interesting things that I'm seeing is I think people are looking at businesses that have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3412.1s	3412.1	 been corrected and saying, hey, what is the true value of this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3416.6s	3416.6	 And I think the best example is Peloton, new CFO, the CFO of Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3422.1s	3422.1	 I got to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3422.7s	3422.7	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3422.9s	3422.9	 I got to go, Jay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3423.5s	3423.5	 I love you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3424.1s	3424.1	 I love you, guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3425.2s	3425.2	 I love you, Jamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3425.9s	3425.9	 And stay safe and enjoy your vacation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3428.3s	3428.3	 Cheers now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3428.8s	3428.8	 So I just, without Jamath here, I just want to talk a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3431.2s	3431.2	 Have you guys watched what happened with Peloton and the CFO coming in and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3434.8s	3434.8	 just really revitalizing that business very quickly?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3437.5s	3437.5	 By the way, Jason, I'll say one thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3438.7s	3438.7	 I think two weeks ago, if you pulled the market, they would probably have, or if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3445.9s	3445.9	 looked at the trading prices of bonds, you probably would have assumed a 95% chance of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3453.5s	3453.5	 a half point rate hike in March.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3456.2s	3456.2	 And as of today, my guess is that the probability of that is below 5%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3463.0s	3463.0	 And you're probably assuming a quarter point rate hike or maybe even a deferral at this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3470.7s	3470.7	 point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3471.1s	3471.1	 And I think that's one of the things that's keeping the market up instead of tanking so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3474.6s	3474.6	 much this morning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3475.7s	3475.7	 People are predicting that it's been such bad news that they'll push it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3479.8s	3479.8	 Yeah, they're assuming that under the conditions of great uncertainty like this, the Fed cannot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3484.1s	3484.1	 act as aggressively as they were planning to act.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3486.3s	3486.3	 Interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3486.7s	3486.7	 And as a result, that rate hike would be pushed out and it would continue to keep prices
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3492.6s	3492.6	 somewhat inflated and continue to support the market with cheaper capital and liquidity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3498.1s	3498.1	 So a lot of capital around the world is going to get locked up as armed conflict comes to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3503.3s	3503.3	 bear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3504.3s	3504.3	 And when that happens, markets will tighten up and prices will be affected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3508.7s	3508.7	 And so the Fed in traditional and typical times would want to have an incentive or would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3513.5s	3513.5	 have a motivation to inject liquidity into the markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3518.3s	3518.3	 And so this is not a great time to do a half point rate hike.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3521.3s	3521.3	 And so it's almost certain at this point that they're not going to do a half point rate hike.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3524.7s	3524.7	 Feels to me like huge setup right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3526.9s	3526.9	 People have capitulated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3527.9s	3527.9	 The markets gotten demolished.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3530.2s	3530.2	 I just think these companies are still great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3532.3s	3532.3	 Like Zoom is still a great company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3533.4s	3533.4	 There's some great businesses out there and some great companies to invest in, some great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3537.3s	3537.3	 stocks to buy all the way from technology through to industrials through to even some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3543.1s	3543.1	 of the energy companies that are going to benefit greatly from this commodity cycle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3546.1s	3546.1	 we're kind of in the middle of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3548.7s	3548.7	 And so there's going to be, I think, an opportunity to move away from speculative behavior into real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3557.9s	3557.9	 kind of cherry picking, productive, cash generating businesses in the next, or even growth businesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3566.4s	3566.4	 that are actual value craters versus being like 10 year speculative kind of bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3572.6s	3572.6	 So this is a great time to kind of be looking for businesses you really like to own,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3577.0s	3577.0	 to identify them, to make investments and to hold those investments for a very long period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3582.2s	3582.2	 You're not going to find a lot of market conditions like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3584.1s	3584.1	 I mean, if we all went back to March of 2020 and you remember the S&P was at 2300.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3590.3s	3590.3	 Yeah, I was going to buy Disney.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3591.4s	3591.4	 I never got around to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3592.3s	3592.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3592.5s	3592.5	 So like if at that point you pick businesses that you knew were going to be durable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3596.3s	3596.3	 businesses and that you loved and you thought were going to have legs to them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3598.9s	3598.9	 you bought everything from Alphabet to Disney to Lockheed Martin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3603.3s	3603.3	 You know, you could have done tremendously well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3605.6s	3605.6	 So now's a great time to kind of be looking for businesses that you really like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3609.2s	3609.2	 and to buy a stake in them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3611.3s	3611.3	 Forget about trying to time the bottom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3612.7s	3612.7	 That's a fool's errand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3613.6s	3613.6	 Right. No, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3614.7s	3614.7	 If you want to buy stuff you want to hold for 10 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3617.0s	3617.0	 Things are relatively cheap relative to a time horizon, as Sax pointed out and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3622.3s	3622.3	 Gertzner pointed out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3623.1s	3623.1	 So things are relatively cheap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3624.7s	3624.7	 Find businesses you like to own and buy them cheap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3627.7s	3627.7	 They could get cheaper, but they're kind of at the bottom end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3631.0s	3631.0	 I think the whole time frame around like speculative stuff is kind of wiped out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3634.3s	3634.3	 Like I think that that that era is gone now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3636.4s	3636.4	 What are you saying?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3637.5s	3637.5	 Well, it's that plus I think one of the things that happened is that people are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3641.6s	3641.6	 realizing now that the burst of activity, especially like in e-commerce type
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3646.8s	3646.8	 companies that happened during the pandemic, that was not ongoing sustainable growth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3652.3s	3652.3	 It was one time growth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3654.2s	3654.2	 In fact, in many cases it was sort of worse than one time growth, which is it was pull
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3658.4s	3658.4	 forward growth, meaning that growth in the future will be lower because you pulled forward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3662.1s	3662.1	 all of that revenue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3663.4s	3663.4	 Well, I think Peloton might be a good example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3665.1s	3665.1	 I mean, everyone bought them during the pandemic, but then after the pandemic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3669.4s	3669.4	 everyone who needs one has got one already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3671.5s	3671.5	 So it could also be cars, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3672.9s	3672.9	 Like people were desperate to buy cars and now there's none available.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3675.9s	3675.9	 Right. So what happened is not only have multiples gone down, but these companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3679.8s	3679.8	 were being comped based on growth rates that were unsustainable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3682.7s	3682.7	 And so now they're all revising their forecast down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3685.7s	3685.7	 So it's a double whammy and Brad's made this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3688.5s	3688.5	 But what's interesting right now is the markets are actually rallying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3691.8s	3691.8	 And I think it might be because of this latest Biden news at this press conference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3697.8s	3697.8	 So the important point here is that Biden did not sanction Putin directly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3702.7s	3702.7	 There was talk about sanctioning him personally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3706.0s	3706.0	 And he also did not remove Russia from the Swift system, which is like sort of the key
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3710.6s	3710.6	 banking system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3711.9s	3711.9	 And I don't know if this is because Biden doesn't want to do it or because Europe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3715.5s	3715.5	 won't support the move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3716.3s	3716.3	 Pretty clear Europe doesn't want to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3718.6s	3718.6	 So no one is willing to suffer too much economic loss here to defend Ukraine, never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3724.4s	3724.4	 mind sending troops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3725.8s	3725.8	 So it seems to me that the signal here is that both militarily and in terms of economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3733.2s	3733.2	 interest, Europe does not want further escalation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3736.9s	3736.9	 And that may be why the market is rallying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3739.7s	3739.7	 Also, the Fed may hold off on interest rate increases while this is all going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3745.0s	3745.0	 So, you know, sometimes markets can act in funny ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3749.1s	3749.1	 Well, they're forward looking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3750.8s	3750.8	 People are putting money at stake so they have skin in the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3754.7s	3754.7	 So it's, you know, they people can talk all they want about what's going to happen with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3761.1s	3761.1	 the markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3761.5s	3761.5	 But unless they're placing bets, that's kind of cheap talk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3764.5s	3764.5	 And here people are actually placing bets on stocks they think will do well in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3769.8s	3769.8	 Skin in the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3770.7s	3770.7	 People look, their economic interests are skin to the game, having people's sons and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3775.5s	3775.5	 daughters go off to fight and die in some foreign war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3779.5s	3779.5	 That is real skin to the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3781.1s	3781.1	 What is not skin to the game is people tweeting, you know, their more outrage and condemnation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3786.1s	3786.1	 and whipping things up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3787.7s	3787.7	 And, you know, we should not be listening to that and calling everyone who disagrees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3791.4s	3791.4	 them traitors because that's happening too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3794.1s	3794.1	 You know, this is a time for cooler heads to prevail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3796.3s	3796.3	 You and I are going to actually agree on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3800.3s	3800.3	 And we're both going to agree that Trump and Pompeo should not be fawning over Putin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3806.1s	3806.1	 Yeah, but you never commented on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3807.9s	3807.9	 Let's get people want to hear us get into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3810.1s	3810.1	 Well, I mean, you can't support them fawning over Putin like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3814.3s	3814.3	 Do you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3815.0s	3815.0	 I can't imagine you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3815.9s	3815.9	 Look, I heard what Trump said when he was saying I didn't hear the Pompeo quote, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3821.5s	3821.5	 I can't speak to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3822.2s	3822.2	 The saying is a genius.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3823.9s	3823.9	 Look, listen, you know, sometimes Trump is being sarcastic when he says things like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3829.5s	3829.5	 oh, what a beauty, you know, he means the opposite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3832.5s	3832.5	 And I think the point Trump was making wasn't really about Putin being so great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3836.1s	3836.1	 The point I heard Trump making was that if he were president, this wouldn't be happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3840.2s	3840.2	 Now, you can disagree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3841.5s	3841.5	 It may be true or untrue, but that was the real point he was making.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3845.0s	3845.0	 I think that you're letting, you know, the political partisans try to whip this thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3851.5s	3851.5	 up and as part again, as part of this meme of anybody who doesn't support what I want,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3857.1s	3857.1	 must be a traitor and must be in the pocket of truth of Putin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3860.3s	3860.3	 We have to use this meme warfare to get people free bird to shame these politicians into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3869.4s	3869.4	 backing like the solar plan and doing something meaningful like this, like and backing nuclear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3874.6s	3874.6	 How do we get the politicians to reflect energy independence as a priority?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3879.9s	3879.9	 It feels like it's not a priority for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3882.3s	3882.3	 Well, I mean, one of the good things about American democracy is that politicians are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3888.7s	3888.7	 generally pretty responsive to what their constituents want to believe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3893.1s	3893.1	 So they use polling data and that polling data drives, you know, if they want to get reelected,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3899.2s	3899.2	 they better do what the polls are telling them people want them to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3903.4s	3903.4	 And so ultimately, if you can kind of influence people broadly in the United States,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3908.7s	3908.7	 and that can go both ways, by the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3910.6s	3910.6	 We have special interests too and you have people with weird ideas, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3914.3s	3914.3	 Yeah, but generally, like if something is deeply unpopular,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3917.5s	3917.5	 politician risks not getting reelected, they're not going to kind of run to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3921.6s	3921.6	 And if something is very popular, even though it may not be the right thing by some objective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3925.7s	3925.7	 framework, you know, they would still run to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3928.7s	3928.7	 So, you know, I do think that there's, you know, some degree of work to be done around,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3934.7s	3934.7	 you know, framing for people broadly, you know, via the work maybe that we do on our podcast,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3940.3s	3940.3	 but I think more importantly, on a repeated way and in a way that's kind of inspiring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3947.1s	3947.1	 and inclusive, will drive people to kind of want to see these changes happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3951.1s	3951.1	 And ultimately, politicians should respond.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3953.1s	3953.1	 Can I make one other point to your thing about, you know, who today would be considered,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3958.6s	3958.6	 you know, in the words of Jeb Pesachy, parroting Russian talking points, Barack Obama.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3963.6s	3963.6	 If Obama today were out there saying exactly what he told the Atlantic magazine back in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3970.2s	3970.2	 I think it was 2012 or 14, if he was saying that today, he'd be accused of being in Putin's pocket
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3978.6s	3978.6	 and being a Putin apologist and a traitor and all this kind of stuff, because he said that in that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3984.1s	3984.1	 interview, he said, listen, Putin was always very businesslike, he was punctual, he showed up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3988.5s	3988.5	 he wanted to negotiate and deal. Basically, he sounded like a guy who, look, we may disagree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3993.4s	3993.4	 with him about everything, but he wasn't a madman. He was someone you could talk to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3997.5s	3997.5	 A rational actor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=3999.0s	3999.0	 He was a coldly ruthless, but rational actor. And that's basically what Obama said. He's someone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4005.1s	4005.1	 you could talk Turkey with. And if you say that today, that, hey, maybe we could negotiate our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4010.8s	4010.8	 way out of this with Putin, you're accused of being, you know, a puppet of his.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4016.7s	4016.7	 Yeah. The concept of starting a war in this day and age is just, it's crazy. Like, it is crazy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4024.4s	4024.4	 that he's starting this war and putting all these people at risk, and we don't even know what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4028.7s	4028.7	 goal is. He's not even asked for anything. Like, what is he exactly asking for? So he may not be,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4035.1s	4035.1	 he may have been rational then, or maybe Obama was trying to steer him towards rationality and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4040.0s	4040.0	 praising him publicly to get that more rational Putin to show up. This feels like irrational,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4044.7s	4044.7	 that we don't know what his goal is. Like the fact that the world can't say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4048.8s	4048.8	 if we gave him X, he would do Y is I think his strategy. Putin's always like to be this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4054.7s	4054.7	 like unpredictable madman, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4057.1s	4057.1	 No, I mean, we just said that he's a coldly ruthless, rational actor. That's sort of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4060.9s	4060.9	 opposite of a madman. I mean, his red lines have been clear. He's been stating them for years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4066.8s	4066.8	 The problem is that again, we're conducting-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4068.7s	4068.7	 I'm referring him to murdering opponents of his and-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4071.5s	4071.5	 Oh, there's no question that he's ruthless. He's an authoritarian. Call him a dictator if you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4076.3s	4076.3	 I've tweeted in support of Alexei Navalny. So I get it, but that doesn't mean he's a madman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4083.0s	4083.0	 He has desires and interests, and it's the job of diplomats to figure out how to conduct
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4090.2s	4090.2	 diplomacy and negotiation with people you disagree with. And one of the problems we have today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4094.9s	4094.9	 is again, we've Twitterized everything. So, you know, we basically figure out the first step is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4100.0s	4100.0	 who are the people who should be canceled? You know, who's wearing the white hat? Who's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4103.1s	4103.1	 wearing the black hat? Let's all rise up in virtue signal and moral denunciation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4107.4s	4107.4	 and, you know, stick our fingers in our ears and not listen to the other side. And listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4113.9s	4113.9	 that is a way to find yourself in greater conflicts, not avoid them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4119.1s	4119.1	 Yeah. All right. So just wrapping up here, let's wrap with Saxe's favorite part of the show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4125.2s	4125.2	 Saxe's favorite moment where he's super engaged in learning. He's got his thinking cap on. He's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4131.0s	4131.0	 taking notes. And that is the science corner. No, not there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4137.9s	4137.9	 What about Vendetta Corner? I thought you were going to say Vendetta Corner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4140.6s	4140.6	 Yeah. What about, is there anything on your Vendetta Corner this week?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4143.3s	4143.3	 Vendetta Corner is actually my favorite part of the show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4145.2s	4145.2	 It is. Now, people love Vendetta Corner in the Twitter community spaces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4149.0s	4149.0	 Yeah, they already do. Well, of course, Twitter loves it because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4151.3s	4151.3	 Twitter is all about Vendettas, but I have no Vendettas this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42_znM48aE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=66&t=4154.5s	4154.5	 Vendetta free week? What are you doing with your time?
