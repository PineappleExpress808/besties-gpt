https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=19.2s	19.2	 What is the vibe in Italy post pandemic? Obviously they had the roughest of any nation I think

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=34.7s	34.7	 Decided that they don't ever want to go through it again. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=37.8s	37.8	 Everybody wore a mask and um people socially distanced. There's a lots of dinners outside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=42.9s	42.9	 No restaurants were really seating people indoors. You'd walk into a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=46.9s	46.9	 store and you'd have to put some you know, puro on your hands and wear a mask and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=92.3s	92.3	 was uh was mexico specifically cabo and that was it was a great place to be for a couple of months nobody cares

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=100.7s	100.7	 um, but actually um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=103.0s	103.0	 It was great. It was a great place to be in the early stages of the pandemic because everyone was wearing masks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=107.8s	107.8	 You know, they did take it really seriously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=110.0s	110.0	 And uh, there were very few cases and seemed like it was under control at least in the area I was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=115.5s	115.5	 and then um, you know, we came back to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=118.6s	118.6	 san francisco for for school for for the kids school, which um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=122.9s	122.9	 you know, i'm not sure we have to be here, but um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=125.4s	125.4	 But that's that's that's what we came back for actually open
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=128.4s	128.4	 Are they going to school or they keep pushing it out two weeks like my kids are yeah

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=134.4s	134.4	 But I think they keep trying to figure out when they're gonna be able to start doing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=138.1s	138.1	 So it's all zoom based right now

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=145.7s	145.7	 Glorified a little bit. I mean a little bit. I think it's it's it's difficult

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=167.9s	167.9	 Here in california moving from the outer layer of covet to the middle layer of california's proposed wealth tax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=175.6s	175.6	 to the uh inner layers of uh extreme heat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=179.4s	179.4	 Smoke and the absolute central layer of pain. Uh more recently my three-year-old daughter decided 34 nights ago to not sleep anymore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=187.7s	187.7	 so, um, yeah, we've been living living the life it's been glorious and um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=193.4s	193.4	 You know, I wear a mask now for covet and then I wear another mask on top of that mask for the smoke
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=198.3s	198.3	 So we're just living the california dream what my parents immigrated here for, you know paradise

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=211.7s	211.7	 Had a great time I guess nobody cares

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=226.6s	226.6	 I can't imagine jcal being sad, but I actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=229.8s	229.8	 had a talk with uh my wife and I said I what are the symptoms of depression because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=235.0s	235.0	 I I think I might have depression and I went through and I was like, I don't have depression. I'm just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=239.1s	239.1	 I have great empathy for all the people suffering and it you know, I just being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=244.5s	244.5	 Isolated you guys know me very well better than anybody like I like to talk to people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=248.9s	248.9	 And it's been really difficult for me to i'll be totally candid to be isolated like this and the podcast is is great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=255.1s	255.1	 And doing this podcast is great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=256.9s	256.9	 But man, I miss people I just miss what are the what are the symptoms of your depression just before you were self-diagnosing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=263.2s	263.2	 I'm just curious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=264.9s	264.9	 I was I I was feeling like um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=268.1s	268.1	 Just sad about watching the riots and watch people shoot each other and then watching
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=273.4s	273.4	 You know the the the wildfires watching people die unnecessarily and then watching the madness for the election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=279.5s	279.5	 It was just all becoming like I wouldn't say overwhelming, but it just made me very sad that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=285.4s	285.4	 You know so many people can't go back to work and then the stock market's ripping and it's a very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=290.2s	290.2	 I don't know how you guys feel but it feels very surreal right because in our world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=295.0s	295.0	 And I don't know how your portfolios and investments are doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=297.9s	297.9	 You know a lot of the companies we've invested in as angel investors, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=302.4s	302.4	 Are doing just wonderfully and we're investing more than ever but then you turn on the television. It's like the doom scrolling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=308.5s	308.5	 Is crazy, so I had to just stop doom scrolling. I think that was the key thing schumath was just looking at twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=313.3s	313.3	 Is that the trending topics?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=316.0s	316.0	 Is so depressing and and just so overwhelming at times that I took three days off this weekend and went camping and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=323.1s	323.1	 I literally didn't pull up twitter and I felt much better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=325.6s	325.6	 So I think it's really twitter related like just opening up the trending topics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=328.8s	328.8	 I don't know if you did that on your holiday in italy, but it really is a quick way to get depressed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=334.1s	334.1	 The best thing is that I was using it in a different time zone. And so I was basically out of the flow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=340.0s	340.0	 and it makes a huge difference because then you're not in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=345.5s	345.5	 emotional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=346.9s	346.9	 turmoil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=348.5s	348.5	 of people's immediate reaction and so you can just kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=353.3s	353.3	 Move on and then also I just had a really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=356.7s	356.7	 Fun summer because I really tried to detach and not use my phone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=359.8s	359.8	 I had I had you know, I kept my meetings to a few hours a day and then otherwise I was doing things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=365.3s	365.3	 Yeah, you want to know you want to know my phone call to jacob?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=369.4s	369.4	 Yeah, hey jacob. I I saw on twitter that you're you're sad and lonely. It's like yeah. Yeah, it's like are you suicidal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=376.2s	376.2	 It's like no. Okay. Goodbye
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=380.1s	380.1	 I'm too much of a narco. I'm too much of a narcissist never considered that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=383.0s	383.0	 Distribution but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=385.8s	385.8	 But I do I do want to thank you david for having me down to cabo and we got to have some good times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=390.3s	390.3	 You watch some good movies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=391.8s	391.8	 Uh gladiator extended cut was great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=395.0s	395.0	 Some other movies that we watched could get us cancelled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=397.1s	397.1	 So we won't admit that we watched history of the world or any other mal brooks movies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=400.6s	400.6	 But we had a good time played a couple rounds of golf and that was good times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=403.9s	403.9	 But let's talk about california because I think you know, we're all residents currently of california
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=409.7s	409.7	 But let me just put it out there how many people on the call are considering, uh leaving california
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=417.9s	417.9	 Anybody is that going through anybody's mind right now because it's going through my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=421.0s	421.0	 um for well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=422.8s	422.8	 It's not for me. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=426.3s	426.3	 But uh, I think that california is sort of emblematic of what could happen if you actually have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=432.9s	432.9	 um, you know the legislative bodies plus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=436.9s	436.9	 You know the the top sort of political leader up and down on one ticket
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=442.1s	442.1	 I mean, you know you you basically have like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=445.9s	445.9	 Massive rife incompetence and it's been compounded you never I mean, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=450.8s	450.8	 If people who are democrats would have said oh the best thing that can happen for democrats is if you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=455.7s	455.7	 You know local cities plus an assembly plus the state senate plus the governor as a democrat republicans would have said the same thing for republicans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=465.0s	465.0	 But as it turns out, uh, it basically creates the worst outcomes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=469.7s	469.7	 And so instead what you need is a little diversity of ideas and a little push and pull
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=474.2s	474.2	 Um, but california is like a bunch of clowns in a clown car right now. It's a joke
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=480.3s	480.3	 but i'm not gonna move now a part of an i1 not gonna move is I I you know my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=485.6s	485.6	 Taxes i've set up in such a way where california can't get access to most of my assets. Anyway, so, you know they can pound cent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=494.4s	494.4	 Yeah, yeah david how are you uh, uh sax how are you feeling about california right now, um, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=502.7s	502.7	 Just the craziness in san francisco the homelessness problem in san francisco has become acute during this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=508.3s	508.3	 It's it's really well, it's a it's a disaster and the wealth task on top of it and it's it's a disaster
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=513.6s	513.6	 It's a disaster. Um, I mean i'm not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=516.1s	516.1	 Uh, i'm not leaving or anything, but it's certainly a topic of conversation that's come up a lot and I do know people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=521.2s	521.2	 Who have left?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=522.7s	522.7	 Um, I know a couple of people who you know prominent people in the venture community who've recently moved to austin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=530.0s	530.0	 and it's a horrible time for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=532.7s	532.7	 The the city and state to be proposing all these new taxes as just take one example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=538.6s	538.6	 because people are already realizing that because of covid and and this new sort of work from home and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=545.1s	545.1	 And zoom business culture where you can kind of work from anywhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=549.1s	549.1	 That people are realizing they don't need to be in san francisco or in silicon valley anymore to be you know in the technology industry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=556.0s	556.0	 And so at precisely the time that people were reevaluating where they wanted to be realizing that they could be anywhere california is now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=563.9s	563.9	 You know proposing to massively increase the cost of being here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=567.3s	567.3	 Um, so it's it's horrible timing and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=570.0s	570.0	 You know you do have this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=571.7s	571.7	 uh, it's sort of seemingly chronic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=574.3s	574.3	 Uh issue in san francisco, particularly with with the sort of homeless problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=579.0s	579.0	 Uh just seems to keep getting worse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=581.7s	581.7	 And there's there's sort of this weird
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=584.8s	584.8	 hostility to technology and tech workers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=588.0s	588.0	 Um here that I think is somehow used as a scapegoat to prevent the city from dealing with its real problems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=595.2s	595.2	 And what do you perceive those real problems to be in in the city?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=599.1s	599.1	 I mean you use the term homeless. I think most people looking at the problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=603.5s	603.5	 As one person candidly told me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=605.5s	605.5	 You know what we have is not and I wouldn't say who said this but it's a prominent person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=608.7s	608.7	 They said this, you know jason the issue here is this isn't a homeless problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=611.4s	611.4	 This is a junkie problem and they use specifically said i'm using that term because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=615.5s	615.5	 That's the term to refer to people who are addicted to opioids methamphetamine fentanyl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=620.4s	620.4	 And that if you were to actually unpack what we're calling a homeless crisis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=624.3s	624.3	 It's actually a crisis of drug addiction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=626.9s	626.9	 And specifically fentanyl and I don't know if you guys saw we're going to hit something like 500 overdose deaths this year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=631.6s	631.6	 We're like going to double last year and it's all fentanyl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=634.5s	634.5	 Which is a particularly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=636.1s	636.1	 You know deadly drug. So I mean how much do you think that is the problem david?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=641.6s	641.6	 Huge, I mean it's it's you're right that homelessness is not the the the cause of the issue that homelessness is the consequence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=649.4s	649.4	 of long-term drug addiction and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=651.9s	651.9	 Mental illness. I mean this is the it's the end state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=655.4s	655.4	 And uh, you're right. The city is it's not really tackling the underlying issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=660.5s	660.5	 In fact, it's kind of aiding and abetting them. I mean how many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=664.2s	664.2	 Millions of needles does the city give away every year and that it only collects a small fraction of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=669.0s	669.0	 With the remainder ending up on the streets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=671.6s	671.6	 um, it's just it's it's bonkers and I think part of the problem is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=675.6s	675.6	 that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=676.8s	676.8	 we keep saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=678.3s	678.3	 that until we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=681.4s	681.4	 Is that we can't demand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=683.7s	683.7	 any uh improvement in the situation in terms of homeless people, you know, we have this like poop squad in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=689.9s	689.9	 in san francisco, that's literally cleaning poop off the sidewalks because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=694.3s	694.3	 Um homeless people are using our sidewalks as as like a latrine basically as a bathroom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=700.1s	700.1	 And and what you keep hearing is that well, we can't do anything about that problem until we solve the homeless problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=706.4s	706.4	 And that's a it certainly we should try to solve that problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=709.5s	709.5	 But it's a very long-term, you know difficult and tractable problem in the meantime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=713.6s	713.6	 We can certainly do things like demand that homeless people not do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=718.9s	718.9	 Yeah, and the policing seem to there seems to be a distinct issue with policing right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=724.5s	724.5	 I watched the san francisco tenderloin twitter account david freeberg and they've arrested something like 260 meth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=731.1s	731.1	 meth and fentanyl dealers, but we have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=734.7s	734.7	 Da chesa, I believe his name is who doesn't believe in prosecuting any of those crimes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=741.5s	741.5	 Related to drugs or petty crime freeberg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=743.8s	743.8	 What is the city turned into for you as somebody who's been a long-term investor in the bay area?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=750.7s	750.7	 Um, well I moved here after I graduated college in 2001 and I loved san francisco
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=756.7s	756.7	 It was a quieter city and a quainter city. I honestly um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=761.4s	761.4	 Over the years have found uh the traffic and the congestion and the buildup of the city to be frustrating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=766.7s	766.7	 i'm a little bit of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=767.9s	767.9	 Anomaly in this sense because I think a lot of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=770.1s	770.1	 You know think that the city should continue to grow and progress and build housing and so on those are all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=775.0s	775.0	 Uh, you know fine objectives, but I think the quality of life has degraded for some time in the city as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=780.3s	780.3	 infrastructure hasn't kept up with the uh the changing pace of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=785.0s	785.0	 companies growing here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=786.7s	786.7	 Um, and as a result, we've kind of got this ballooning inflating budget that's been poorly managed. You've got um, I forgot the statistic but there's um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=795.0s	795.0	 Some number of thousand people plus that are city government employees in san francisco earning over three hundred thousand dollars a year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=801.5s	801.5	 Um, and so there's a there's a chronic kind of bureaucratic issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=806.1s	806.1	 Um that is the cancer that has caused uh, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=809.4s	809.4	 A lot of the follow-on crises that I think we're now experiencing acutely here in the city now in terms of leaving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=816.1s	816.1	 To your earlier question. I you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=818.5s	818.5	 Um, I was really like i've just been like everyone, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=822.5s	822.5	 Like the icon kind of talk about the dante inferno layers. It's also like for me growing up. It's like a seven layer burrito
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=828.7s	828.7	 It's like one layer of shit after another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=831.4s	831.4	 um start with the beans and in the middle you got the sour cream and um, you know, this city's just gotten um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=837.6s	837.6	 Kind of and the state has gotten more and more difficult to live in and I and I was certainly thinking and talking to my wife
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=842.3s	842.3	 Like we got to leave her family's here. So we're not going to leave the state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=845.7s	845.7	 But then I get a call last week that uh that I think 18 of us were on with governor newsom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=851.1s	851.1	 And um, you know, he made a couple of really interesting points that really did honestly reset my perspective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=856.8s	856.8	 You know, I've tried to take a step back and think a little bit more broadly about the long-term opportunity in california
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=862.1s	862.1	 The way this state operates right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=865.7s	865.7	 It's the fifth largest economy in the world. They ran a surplus their refinance their debt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=869.7s	869.7	 They've done a great job kind of managing kind of the fiscal gap that that's that's being created by the covid crisis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=875.6s	875.6	 Um, and you know governor newsom made a point like we have had the california exodus story that's percolated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=882.2s	882.2	 And cycled really for decades
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=884.3s	884.3	 Uh, he pointed out an article which i've not been able to find but i've been looking forward from time magazine from 1959
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=890.0s	890.0	 That were like declared this is the year everyone's gonna exodus out of the state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=894.2s	894.2	 And we hear it every couple years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=895.5s	895.5	 There's some crisis that precipitates the mass exodus and it hasn't happened because it is a great place to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=901.1s	901.1	 Is diversified industrial base, it's not just tech tech is a lot of the growth but there's a lot of industry here largest ag producer

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=916.8s	916.8	 It's a great diversified cultural base. It's by the oceans. It's by the mountains
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=920.5s	920.5	 it's an incredible place to live and work and I don't think any of us want to give that up and uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=925.8s	925.8	 and the the media has done a great job kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=930.4s	930.4	 Magnifying these these small stories that aren't really a story
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=933.9s	933.9	 Governor newsom made the case that this wealth tax proposal, you know was one assembly member
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=938.5s	938.5	 It didn't even get into committee. It wasn't even really being considered but it kind of created this this press
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=943.7s	943.7	 Flourish and everyone got involved and everyone I know kind of freaked out about it and it became this kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=949.0s	949.0	 Another catalyzing event, but it wasn't really real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=951.0s	951.0	 So if we kind of broaden our perspective a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=953.5s	953.5	 Both in terms of space and time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=955.2s	955.2	 I think we get a little more kind of comfortable with like of all the places to live and all the places to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=959.5s	959.5	 This is the best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=960.9s	960.9	 And you can go save some taxes and move to austin, but I mean then you got to go live in austin, you know, whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=965.9s	965.9	 Well, it's it's it's the best. It's the best you're right that it's the best in terms of climate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=971.8s	971.8	 geography natural beauty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=974.6s	974.6	 Resources and the industries that have developed here and have you know strong network effects, but it's not the best politically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=982.7s	982.7	 I mean, it's among the worst politically and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=985.7s	985.7	 It seems like the politicians are doing everything they can to mess it up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=988.3s	988.3	 I mean, I almost wonder if there's like a resource curse issue, particularly with san francisco where you know, there's this thing and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=994.7s	994.7	 and um, I mean this this observable thing with governments that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=999.3s	999.3	 That sometimes you get a resource curse where if there's like a lot of oil in the country or something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1003.5s	1003.5	 You end up with with a government that's not very good because people just spend all their time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1007.0s	1007.0	 Going to war to try and capture it and I kind of wonder if you know, san francisco has been the beneficiary of being

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1018.2s	1018.2	 Um ecosystem that had nothing to do with creating and uh, I would say two things to build on what you're saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1025.5s	1025.5	 um, the first is I think that when the economies in an environment are really really good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1032.0s	1032.0	 All the really really smart people want to go into those economies and that leaves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1036.8s	1036.8	 generally dumber people to do things like politics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1039.9s	1039.9	 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1041.1s	1041.1	 And that's less true in places that have shittier economies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1045.1s	1045.1	 Uh, yeah fascinating and I and I actually think that that's that's practically true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1048.7s	1048.7	 We may not want to think it and it may not may sound a little harsh, but it's true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1052.0s	1052.0	 And you know the the way that you reverse it is what singapore does which is you make the civil servants the highest paid people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1058.6s	1058.6	 in the economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1060.0s	1060.0	 Right, and you treat them like knowledge workers and you say wow look i'm going to pay this person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1064.3s	1064.3	 250 000 300 000 a year you're shocked at the quality of the person you get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1068.7s	1068.7	 That's the the first comment I want to make the second one though is is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1072.4s	1072.4	 unlike all these other times where I think people have been um, you know sort of uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1078.5s	1078.5	 prognosticating the doom and gloom of california the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1082.4s	1082.4	 The thing that's different now is that because it is such a dominant political environment for the democrats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1089.5s	1089.5	 It's much easier to judge if they actually know what they're doing and if they are going to do things that are aligned with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1097.5s	1097.5	 Sort of like the moral code
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1100.0s	1100.0	 of the party that elected them and so like let's just talk for example about the fact that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1105.9s	1105.9	 We are not going to have police reform of any kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1111.0s	1111.0	 In california, which is where you'd think would be the first state where people got their act together and said, okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1117.5s	1117.5	 If we really believe that we need to reform police
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1121.1s	1121.1	 we can do it in our own backyards, but that legislation is going to get blocked because uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1126.0s	1126.0	 Californians have decided that they care more about the alignment to police unions than they do to the right of law and to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1132.4s	1132.4	 social justice for minorities and blacks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1134.9s	1134.9	 That's crazy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1136.8s	1136.8	 We should be the most progressive is your point on this chamath and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1140.4s	1140.4	 The point is to say it explicitly is the politicians are in the pocket of the unions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1145.4s	1145.4	 And because they're in the pocket of the police unions and the education unions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1148.5s	1148.5	 We cannot make forward progress even though we're supposed to be the most liberal of all locations, correct? That's in summary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1155.5s	1155.5	 Yeah, exactly. We we we actually if we believe that we have, you know up and down the ticket the ability to implement justice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1163.5s	1163.5	 Right at least justice in the vein of the democratic party and what that platform represents or for example, all of the people that were out protesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1172.2s	1172.2	 Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1173.0s	1173.0	 Uh during black lives matter during that entire movement. I suspect the overwhelming majority are democrats slash progressives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1180.6s	1180.6	 Or you know, let's just say the majority or at a minimum plurality, okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1184.8s	1184.8	 But then the idea that then you have a state the most populous and the richest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1190.6s	1190.6	 Filled up and down the ticket with people who are theoretically aligned with those political values
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1196.1s	1196.1	 But then when push comes to shove and the legislation hits the floor, it basically gets mothballed to me is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1202.2s	1202.2	 Inexcusable and disgusting. Yeah. I mean look at the housing issue. We we just had a bill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1207.0s	1207.0	 That was incredibly simple bill. I think it was 11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1210.7s	1210.7	 Yeah, sp 11 20. I don't know if you followed this one, but i've been following it on the twitter and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1215.6s	1215.6	 It was a very simple piece of legislation any single family home lot could have a duplex on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1221.2s	1221.2	 So you could have two homes on a single lot and they couldn't even pass that in a city where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1226.2s	1226.2	 You know a firefighter a teacher etc cannot live within 90 minutes of where they work and they couldn't even pass that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1233.6s	1233.6	 Also, there's there's also ab5 right? I mean jason has uber's third or fourth investor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1239.6s	1239.6	 Yeah, something to say about that, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1242.4s	1242.4	 Okay, tell me what is it exactly?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1245.2s	1245.2	 I think third or fourth, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1247.9s	1247.9	 Here we go to the bc bragg's controversy. We just yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1250.4s	1250.4	 Could we just can we just pin down exactly which one it is so you could just say you're the fourth investor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1254.6s	1254.6	 Something like that. It's so much better to say third or fourth and that was my snap obviously, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1259.2s	1259.2	 You know ab ab5 is another one look at all the careers in which you can be david sachs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1265.0s	1265.0	 A freelancer and the high the more money you make the more you get to dictate your schedule
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1269.6s	1269.6	 But if you are poor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1271.6s	1271.6	 And if you are in an entry-level job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1274.1s	1274.1	 The california government will not let you even though 70 percent of drivers for these services want to be freelancers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1280.6s	1280.6	 And the services themselves said they will put into a fund for health care like they literally uber
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1286.3s	1286.3	 You know dar is like hey, we're gonna put money into this lift is gonna put money into it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1289.4s	1289.4	 They still will not let people decide for themselves what shift they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1294.0s	1294.0	 It makes no sense. I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1296.8s	1296.8	 And and it trickled into like journalists, too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1299.2s	1299.2	 I mean there's they said now journalists if you write if you if you write 30 articles a year for a single outlet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1306.1s	1306.1	 You're technically considered an employee even though you're writing the articles on your own time with your own research
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1310.8s	1310.8	 And you're getting paid for successful articles for 30 hours a year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1313.9s	1313.9	 Research and you're getting paid for successful articles for good articles that are accepted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1318.1s	1318.1	 And then there was this follow-on controversy about translators. It's like well translators takes five minutes to translate an article
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1323.9s	1323.9	 So why would 30 articles?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1325.9s	1325.9	 Apply to a translator and obviously when you have that degree of confusion and complexity something's off, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1331.7s	1331.7	 Yeah, and it's such a it feels like virtue signaling. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1335.2s	1335.2	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1335.7s	1335.7	 Well, I think well, I mean the reason why ab5 happened is it was at the behest of the teamsters, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1341.4s	1341.4	 They're trying to unionize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1343.2s	1343.2	 The uber and lift drivers and they can't do it unless they're employees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1346.3s	1346.3	 And so, you know the the author of the the bill lorina gonzalez who's sort of in their back pocket
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1353.4s	1353.4	 um, you know that that's why she put forward the bill and then the absurdity of it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1358.0s	1358.0	 That you know, they realized after introducing it that it would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1361.2s	1361.2	 ensnare all these other occupations like the writers and journalists and photographers and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1366.0s	1366.0	 real estate owners
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1367.9s	1367.9	 Yeah, even like people like manicurists and so on right and so what they've been doing is they've been now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1373.6s	1373.6	 Modifying the legislation to exclude all of these categories and in the process they're kind of laying bare
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1379.9s	1379.9	 What's really happening here, which is this is all about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1383.0s	1383.0	 um either basically shutting down or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1386.4s	1386.4	 forcing uber and lyft to comply with um with the will of the teamsters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1392.0s	1392.0	 And it seems like the legislation blinked when uber and lyft said well, we'll just shut the service down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1396.5s	1396.5	 So what were your thoughts on when that happened sax dude? What do you think will happen? Who will win this ab5 shutdown showdown?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1403.0s	1403.0	 Well, the what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1405.0s	1405.0	 Yeah, they threatened to basically stop service and they got a stay I think from a judge. Um, yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1410.5s	1410.5	 So so ab5 doesn't go into effect until november when and there's a ballot initiative that they're sponsoring to get ab5 overturned. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1419.5s	1419.5	 I think you know, I don't I don't it's hard to predict whether it's going to win or not, but that to me is like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1424.8s	1424.8	 Whether if ab5 were defeated by a ballot initiative in november, that'd be a really positive sign for the state of california
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1431.5s	1431.5	 I'll say there was um on this call with governor newson last week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1435.0s	1435.0	 He did point out that ab5 was more of kind of a law of inevitability as a result of that whole dynamex
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1443.6s	1443.6	 uh state supreme court decision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1446.1s	1446.1	 Where the uh, you know, the supreme court basically said look here's the criteria that defines an employee versus an independent contractor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1454.1s	1454.1	 You know, they get to decide what work they do or what hours or whatever and there's like some set of criteria
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1458.4s	1458.4	 And they said look uber drivers and all these other kind of technically independent contractors don't meet those criteria fully
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1463.7s	1463.7	 Therefore they are employees and as a result california
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1467.6s	1467.6	 Assembly tried to and had to effectively codify what it means to be an employee versus an independent contractor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1473.3s	1473.3	 And i'm not arguing for the case
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1474.3s	1474.3	 I'm just saying what was conveyed by a governor last week on why this ended up coming to bear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1479.3s	1479.3	 Now if they strike it down there's going to be some other law that's going to pop up because this of the state supreme the dynamex
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1485.2s	1485.2	 Decision and that's kind of you know, something's going to have to get written down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1488.2s	1488.2	 So sax don't you think it ultimately ends up just being some sort of negotiated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1492.0s	1492.0	 Point between all of these industry leaders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1494.8s	1494.8	 And you know the state to kind of figure out. Okay, what's everyone going to compromise on to to get something written down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1500.4s	1500.4	 That's law. I mean possibly. I mean dynamex is not like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1504.5s	1504.5	 Constitutional it's not a constitutional decision. So the legislature can do whatever it wants here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1510.1s	1510.1	 You know, and so if you were going to respond to dynamex, you don't have to kind of enshrine it. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1517.0s	1517.0	 So and I guess there there was certainly some question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1520.4s	1520.4	 Whether dynamex would apply to uber and lift in in this way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1526.2s	1526.2	 You know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1527.7s	1527.7	 They could have made they could have made their arguments. Um in front of a court, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1531.4s	1531.4	 The okay look the problem is now and whatever applies to california applies to every state legislature
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1538.0s	1538.0	 How are these people supposed to figure this out?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1541.1s	1541.1	 i'm sorry, but like you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1542.8s	1542.8	 Who are we entrusting here to go and then all of a sudden understand the nuances of lift and uber and really understand?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1550.1s	1550.1	 The job that they do versus the translators versus the this person versus the that person versus the dynamex decision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1557.2s	1557.2	 Again, I think 20 years ago. I kind of would have believed that politicians were generally some of the smartest people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1563.7s	1563.7	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1564.7s	1564.7	 You know frankly amongst us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1568.0s	1568.0	 And it really did attract a certain level of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1571.3s	1571.3	 Intellectual person who cared about legislating but you know now basically you just have like, you know, jerry fall wall juniors running around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1578.7s	1578.7	 I mean these these are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1580.8s	1580.8	 They're all just running around until they get caught on instagram and get fired
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1583.6s	1583.6	 I mean, they're just uh, they're not the smartest people that we're dealing with and so what was what was gavin newson's answer to that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1591.2s	1591.2	 It's really what I would you know, the jerry fallwall jr. Point didn't come up tomorrow, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1595.8s	1595.8	 We can we can follow up. I'm sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1598.6s	1598.6	 Right. It does seem to me that if they do become full time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1605.0s	1605.0	 This would be a tragedy for the people who are trying to just do 10 to 20 to 30 hours of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1611.5s	1611.5	 Gig work like what happens to those poor people who wanted to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1615.0s	1615.0	 Fill in between when they dropped their kids off of school and picked them up and just grab a couple hours here there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1619.6s	1619.6	 as a second gig like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1622.1s	1622.1	 If this actually does pass in their full time honestly guys, honestly, you guys are such you you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1627.9s	1627.9	 You're you're honestly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1630.0s	1630.0	 look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1631.3s	1631.3	 It won't affect them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1632.4s	1632.4	 It'll affect the long-term profitability in the margins of the companies that have to hire them as full-time employees and they'll have to like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1638.3s	1638.3	 You know make a bunch of rules and blah blah blah, but it has huge operational implications and it has really terrible op-x implications for a company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1647.2s	1647.2	 But for the person that wants to work 10 hours jason, they'll still be able to work 10 hours
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1650.8s	1650.8	 So I think I think the point is that on a specific shift
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1654.4s	1654.4	 Like they're going to have to come in at a certain shift time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1656.4s	1656.4	 I think the point is like the entire public markets who all of a sudden think that a business looks one way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1662.1s	1662.1	 Has to figure out that it's really a cost plus business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1665.5s	1665.5	 And what it really means is you if you were comfortable with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1669.0s	1669.0	 A 60 or 70 reduction in the market cap of some of these companies you'd be okay with ab5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1674.9s	1674.9	 And I think that's where the tension is where the people that made the law don't care about the market cap because they don't own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1679.5s	1679.5	 The stock anyways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1681.0s	1681.0	 And the people that are reacting to ab5 are the ones that own the stock and are really thinking about the market cap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1687.3s	1687.3	 Well, but the drivers the drivers don't necessarily own the stock and they're against it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1691.2s	1691.2	 No, the drivers own eight shares david, I mean come on no, no, no, that's what i'm saying is they're not shareholders for the most part
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1697.2s	1697.2	 But this really does reduce their flexibility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1701.4s	1701.4	 to contract for their labor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1703.9s	1703.9	 No, but I think what you're saying will happen, which is that they will create a you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1708.5s	1708.5	 ab5 prime which is a modification that's neither this nor what it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1714.6s	1714.6	 uh, but it seems that the tailwinds are pretty clear which is that we're moving to a place where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1720.1s	1720.1	 These companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1721.6s	1721.6	 Have to get built in a very clever way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1724.2s	1724.2	 And even if they are super clever and capturing consumer demand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1728.0s	1728.0	 The unit economics are going to be pretty shitty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1731.1s	1731.1	 And I just think we have to own that and and probably what it means more than anything else is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1735.4s	1735.4	 It's not a real venture kind of business. And so you may be deficit financing it or building it in a very different way than we used
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1742.2s	1742.2	 Right, but it doesn't have to be that way. What you're saying is is I think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1746.7s	1746.7	 This law will have very adverse consequences for their business. Okay, I mean I grant you that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1752.5s	1752.5	 But it's it's what why is the the state interfering?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1756.0s	1756.0	 In the relationship between uber and its drivers in this way when everyone's happy with it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1759.5s	1759.5	 No, but it's not I think what actually is happening is the state is effectively capturing the excess return
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1765.2s	1765.2	 of uber and lift
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1766.9s	1766.9	 Meaning I think if you just take a pure unemotional economic view at this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1771.2s	1771.2	 It's like any other market if there's a huge amount of margin available and there are not many competitors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1776.6s	1776.6	 What happens is somebody comes in to take the excess margin?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1780.7s	1780.7	 So you think that's the government that wants to take it and the unions want to take it? Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1787.2s	1787.2	 Should we let them then dictate what hours people work the thought exercise that I would ask guys if there was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1793.6s	1793.6	 In a market 90 different competitors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1796.8s	1796.8	 for transportation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1798.8s	1798.8	 Would ab5 have been written?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1802.4s	1802.4	 Past adopted and my answer to you would be that it would not have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1806.9s	1806.9	 So uber and lifts and door dashes success is what leads to people wanting to get a cut and get a slice the oligopolist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1813.7s	1813.7	 Model of success where not enough other companies are pulled through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1817.3s	1817.3	 Got it. Well, that gives us a good segue into by the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1819.9s	1819.9	 Sorry last point on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1821.5s	1821.5	 And the funny thing is the people who created the problem are the ones that hate it the most which are the investors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1826.1s	1826.1	 Because they pile in the incremental dollars into the winners trying to king make a winner through capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1832.4s	1832.4	 And now what's happening is their rate of returns are basically getting taken away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1836.0s	1836.0	 And I think that in in in a weird way, that's also kind of fair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1841.9s	1841.9	 Well, I I would just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1844.4s	1844.4	 disagree slightly in the sense that just because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1847.2s	1847.2	 This has big distributional consequences like basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1851.5s	1851.5	 Who who makes the the surplus?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1853.8s	1853.8	 Uh doesn't mean it also doesn't have a huge deadweight loss associated with it and whenever you prohibit people from engaging in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1860.8s	1860.8	 The type of economic contracts relationship that they want to engage in you're reducing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1866.0s	1866.0	 Um surplus and so I I so I hear what you're saying but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1869.8s	1869.8	 And I think there is I think this is all about regulatory capture, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1873.0s	1873.0	 This is the teamsters trying to capture a big piece of the value of uber through their politicians the legislature
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1879.6s	1879.6	 So you're right about that, but I also think that we should care about it not just as uber shareholders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1885.2s	1885.2	 But as consumers of the product because it's going to get worse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1889.2s	1889.2	 Well, and also the product's going to go away in certain jurisdictions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1892.0s	1892.0	 I mean if freeburg wants to get an uber north of the golden gate bridge or in the east bay somewhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1898.7s	1898.7	 They're just not going to have the economics or I got some communities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1903.0s	1903.0	 Yeah to even operate the service
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1904.8s	1904.8	 So just like uber eats and postmates stopped delivering to treasure island
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1908.4s	1908.4	 A lot of the drivers were in their local communities at home with uber turned on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1913.1s	1913.1	 And when they or door dash and when they got a call they would leave their house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1916.5s	1916.5	 And that was part of the magic of it is you can just be sitting there, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1919.6s	1919.6	 Netflixing or hanging out with your kids and then a good call comes in and then you leave your house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1923.2s	1923.2	 That's why you would have that like one minute pause if you ever saw it, you know at an uber ride where it's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1927.3s	1927.3	 Why why isn't the car moving? It's because that person's at home and they were capturing the the one ride every hour
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1933.2s	1933.2	 In their local, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1935.6s	1935.6	 Suburban area, but if you force them to be hourly we were going to say you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1939.2s	1939.2	 It's not worth having an eight-hour shift in you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1941.9s	1941.9	 Whatever a suburb and and the service will go away and then guess who's going to not have service and transportation. I think for people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1949.4s	1949.4	 Okay, so I was saying it was like sax's point like, you know from a consumer perspective or chamath's point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1954.0s	1954.0	 if you end up with 90 of these service providers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1956.8s	1956.8	 and um, i'm a consumer i'm less likely to order a cab or order a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1962.3s	1962.3	 Rideshare service or i'm less likely to order food for delivery. I don't want to deal with 50 fucking apps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1967.0s	1967.0	 I don't want to have to like go find the one app that has the contract with the one restaurant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1971.8s	1971.8	 Then the natural market dynamics the the way that the market naturally evolves is I want simplicity as a consumer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1978.0s	1978.0	 I want efficiency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1979.4s	1979.4	 That's what makes me want to use it more and when you take that away because you're interfering from a regulatory perspective and how that market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1985.5s	1985.5	 Operates the product sucks for me and the shareholders ultimately suffer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1990.4s	1990.4	 I think to your point the way that that would probably get solved is you have people that are higher order in the consumer behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=1996.9s	1996.9	 that own these relationships that enforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2000.0s	2000.0	 basically, uh a user experience for example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2003.8s	2003.8	 Facebook and google and apple essentially say we're abstracting all these services because there's 90 of you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2010.8s	2010.8	 Google says i'm going to put all of you guys on the map view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2014.2s	2014.2	 Um, you know yelp says the same thing and essentially what opens what happens is there's some like open way where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2021.0s	2021.0	 essentially, uh a service provider can turn themselves on and broadcast into a network that says i'm available to do a for b
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2029.1s	2029.1	 And it all gets fixed now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2031.3s	2031.3	 That's a future state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2033.2s	2033.2	 Which was the original idea of uber by the way was to make a marketplace like that and now uber is talking about doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2038.0s	2038.0	 A franchise exactly what you're saying. Chamath is let some franchisee take the east bay and then provide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2043.6s	2043.6	 Their inventory to the uber network. I think franchising is a really really smart business idea and I think that particularly in transportation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2051.8s	2051.8	 And a lot of these services that have this natural dynamic to be local
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2057.7s	2057.7	 Where there there are an infinite sum of many local markets. I think it's it's like a burger king
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2063.1s	2063.1	 It's like a mcdonald's and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2065.2s	2065.2	 The the company that moves to a franchising model and then figures it out. I think will be a huge winner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2071.6s	2071.6	 Um, and that will be and that will be a very asset light
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2075.2s	2075.2	 really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2076.3s	2076.3	 operationally, uh sophisticated very well-run highly profitable business, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2083.3s	2083.3	 Let's talk about the public markets. Um, wait jason, can we just talk about the police brutality thing in california?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2088.2s	2088.2	 I just want to get your guys's take like it really it really bothers me that california
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2093.2s	2093.2	 like I bet you there's going to be states that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2095.8s	2095.8	 Um diverse in its democratic and republican composition and some republican states, uh that passed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2104.5s	2104.5	 comprehensive police reform and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2107.2s	2107.2	 California will be one of the laggards. What do you think if you could wave a magic wand chamath?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2111.9s	2111.9	 What are the one two and three things take a minute to think it through and everybody on the call can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2116.5s	2116.5	 What are the one two and three things you would do to change policing in the united states?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2121.3s	2121.3	 I have my own list, but i'm curious what you guys think and I and I actually put a tweet storm out about my number one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2126.4s	2126.4	 thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2127.2s	2127.2	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2128.4s	2128.4	 What are the specific tactical things? Let's get tactical first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2131.6s	2131.6	 I mean the first one that i've always been a big fan of as i've studied it at least from 10 000 feet is ending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2136.7s	2136.7	 qualified immunity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2138.1s	2138.1	 Um explain why and what that is?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2140.4s	2140.4	 you know qualified immunity is essentially that there there there is this immunity that uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2144.8s	2144.8	 certain individuals have and that they uh that they're not subject to prosecution and so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2150.7s	2150.7	 um, you know, they essentially have a carte blanche to behave in ways that can be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2155.4s	2155.4	 Good in some cases very very bad in other cases gray in other cases yet. There's no adjudication of their behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2162.8s	2162.8	 And so you have to allow people with solid dispassionate detached judgment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2168.4s	2168.4	 To be able to enter and say hey listen you were way out of line here and there are consequences for it and people coming in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2176.4s	2176.4	 Doing those jobs need to understand those consequences versus you have a carte blanche to basically do whatever you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2182.4s	2182.4	 And I think let's talk specifically about the murder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2185.6s	2185.6	 The shooting involving I would say murder right now, um, because I think all the facts are not in but jacob blake was shot in the back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2192.2s	2192.2	 Um, he was obviously not listening to the police the police then followed him to his car
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2197.7s	2197.7	 There's a discussion of if there was a knife on the floorboard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2200.8s	2200.8	 um and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2202.1s	2202.1	 Point-blank they shot him in the back multiple times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2205.1s	2205.1	 And i've heard both sides of this, you know, this person is not listening to the police
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2209.0s	2209.0	 This person's going into the car. They're reaching potentially for a weapon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2212.9s	2212.9	 And the cops had no choice. It seemed to me that you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2216.8s	2216.8	 The training of a police officer might actually be that that was a legitimate shooting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2221.0s	2221.0	 um, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2222.5s	2222.5	 That means maybe they have to rethink policing because you could have easily taken that person down with even the most modest of a chokehold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2228.8s	2228.8	 Or a tackle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2230.1s	2230.1	 And when we see that it feels like that's the raw shock test right there of like how you look at shootings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2234.9s	2234.9	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2235.9s	2235.9	 In police when you saw that shooting I take it tremoth of jacob blake and I I saw it and I I just like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2242.7s	2242.7	 I I can't see these anymore. They they send me off the rails for days. Uh, but yeah, I did see it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2247.6s	2247.6	 I did see it. Yeah, and so I mean when you when you look at something like that, that's clearly training has to change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2252.4s	2252.4	 because I I believe that based on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2256.3s	2256.3	 Police training and qualified immunity this is going to be considered even though it's shocking to see it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2262.4s	2262.4	 I think it's going to be considered
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2264.3s	2264.3	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2265.6s	2265.6	 You know an allowed shooting or yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2267.7s	2267.7	 And there's not going to the person's not going to be prosecuted because the person was clearly not listening and there was a knife
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2272.1s	2272.1	 On the floor and he was going for it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2273.6s	2273.6	 You know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2274.1s	2274.1	 It seems to me like we really need to change the actual training the average is six months of training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2279.2s	2279.2	 So I think that's one of the top things that has to change is that these these police officers have to be trained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2284.9s	2284.9	 Not to fire first but to to use other tactics. So so for me the first one is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2291.2s	2291.2	 the second one for me, which i'm a really big fan of is that there needs to be a new way to actually intercept
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2297.1s	2297.1	 911 calls and instead of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2299.9s	2299.9	 um deploying police officers we have a separate branch of people that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2304.7s	2304.7	 You know massively pay and train that are effectively, you know social workers plus plus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2310.4s	2310.4	 Negotiators, yeah, and and they should be deployed in all kinds of situations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2315.2s	2315.2	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2316.4s	2316.4	 Where I think that what what people want is a de-escalation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2321.4s	2321.4	 And I think that sometimes the words
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2324.7s	2324.7	 De-escalation and police don't really sync up and in most a lot of people's minds they think of escalation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2330.7s	2330.7	 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2331.6s	2331.6	 people who are trained to de-escalate I think uh, and so for example like, you know all of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2337.6s	2337.6	 Mental health checks all of the mental health issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2340.8s	2340.8	 Could probably be dealing with folks like this domestic disturbances would probably go into that category
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2345.9s	2345.9	 The third one is I would very much rationalize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2348.8s	2348.8	 drug use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2350.0s	2350.0	 um, just because I think the amount of low level offenses and arrests around drug use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2355.5s	2355.5	 Is antiquated for people's general views on drugs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2359.5s	2359.5	 and I think that it needs to sort of correlate to how society views it and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2363.6s	2363.6	 Um, you know the the last two that I would give you is that there's a concept of no knock warrants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2368.7s	2368.7	 That's how bryanna taylor was killed insane
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2372.1s	2372.1	 It's it's kind of really scary the idea that we could all be sitting in our houses right now as we are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2377.1s	2377.1	 And literally the police
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2379.0s	2379.0	 Can just charge in I mean totally unnecessarily. I mean she was being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2384.0s	2384.0	 For some like low level drug idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2385.6s	2385.6	 They're going to knock the doors in and of course the person is going to try to protect themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2389.8s	2389.8	 That's the domain house sax what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2391.8s	2391.8	 Are they not they knocked the doors in and they were plain clothes wearing police officers?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2397.1s	2397.1	 So people are coming and they did it at like midnight when she was asleep. So yeah people busting into her house at midnight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2405.0s	2405.0	 Screaming making noise and not dressed as cops. That's that's what are we?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2409.8s	2409.8	 Yeah, and then the last one I would give you is militarization of police
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2413.6s	2413.6	 A lot of these ideas by the way are justin amush's ideas. I i've retweeted and I followed but he was the one that put me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2419.1s	2419.1	 onto these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2420.2s	2420.2	 Um, but you know like you have all this excess military equipment in the army that gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2424.5s	2424.5	 Basically passed through and now directly sold into police departments, especially post 9 11. We we basically militarized them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2430.0s	2430.0	 So those are what are your ideas around policing and how we should change it? You've heard jamans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2435.6s	2435.6	 I I don't have more detailed ideas than than chamath. I think he's given some good ones. Um for sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2441.0s	2441.0	 I mean, I think we definitely need better training and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2444.4s	2444.4	 I think better oversight over the use of force. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2447.7s	2447.7	 The the body cam idea jason i've seen you you tweet about I think that's pretty interesting, too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2452.5s	2452.5	 Um, I think you're right. I'll just explain that for a minute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2455.6s	2455.6	 The body cam idea I had was I asked does anybody know and you know, does black live matter or another organization track?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2462.3s	2462.3	 Which police departments because we could get a list of every police department that exists in some database somewhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2467.1s	2467.1	 Do we actually know what percentage actually have body cams and what model they use and what percentage are working?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2472.6s	2472.6	 because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2473.6s	2473.6	 one of the things that I think has happened this year is you know, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2477.5s	2477.5	 live streaming and the live video and the number of smartphones out there has resulted in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2482.6s	2482.6	 us being able to see what black and brown people have been telling us for decades, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2487.2s	2487.2	 They're murdered by cops and now we get to see it and you know when you see george floyd get murdered
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2492.8s	2492.8	 It's fairly obvious that that's what happened. We don't have a video or they have the video of reanna taylor getting murdered
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2497.5s	2497.5	 So that's from a cop webcam
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2500.1s	2500.1	 I'm sorry body cam
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2501.0s	2501.0	 So I was thinking we should just start with that as a basic which is every single cop car should have a 360 camera
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2506.4s	2506.4	 Every cop it should be a federal mandate and I don't exactly know how federal mandates work sacks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2510.9s	2510.9	 But don't you think there should be a federal mandate for just cameras and car cameras?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2516.4s	2516.4	 I think it's a good idea. I think the use of cameras is a good idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2519.0s	2519.0	 um, I mean maybe not recording the police officers when they're sitting in their car, but every time there's like uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2525.0s	2525.0	 A call, you know like yeah, they pull somebody over sort of you know, like fourth amendment type search and seizure seizure type situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2532.5s	2532.5	 Yeah, I think it would make sense to have that on video. Why not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2536.0s	2536.0	 Yeah, I mean, I think every police will behave better go ahead free bird
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2540.4s	2540.4	 Um, there was a case the other day, uh, uh young, um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2545.2s	2545.2	 Guy, I think he was 19 years old was shot in dc named dion k. I don't know if any of you guys watched the body cam footage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2551.6s	2551.6	 Um, and so he was a 19 year old black man. He was shot died
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2555.8s	2555.8	 Um, but in the body cam footage, you can see that he pulls out this gun and throws it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2560.3s	2560.3	 And when he pulls out the gun and flings his hand around he's got the gun in his hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2563.2s	2563.2	 That's when the cop shot him and so there was about 100 protesters that showed up, but it's largely become a non-story
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2569.6s	2569.6	 As a result of the facts associated with the body cam footage, but I just want to propose something else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2574.3s	2574.3	 It's a little bit more radical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2576.1s	2576.1	 Maybe my libertarian ideals kind of cross with my socialist ideals and forming this this concept, but perhaps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2583.6s	2583.6	 um, you're a socialist no, yeah, I don't know i've never been accused of that but um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2588.7s	2588.7	 if we uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2590.6s	2590.6	 if we trace back, you know the uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2593.2s	2593.2	 These systems are really chaotic everything you're talking about is layers and layers of bureaucracy and ideas and shit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2597.9s	2597.9	 We should do to manage the problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2599.8s	2599.8	 But there is kind of one common, you know butterfly effect butterflies at the source of all of a lot of what we're talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2606.0s	2606.0	 Which is guns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2607.5s	2607.5	 If there weren't any guns in the united states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2610.5s	2610.5	 I would not feel threatened as a police officer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2612.8s	2612.8	 I would never have any reason to feel threatened and I would never have any reason to pull a gun
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2616.8s	2616.8	 The reason I always make to pull a gun as a police officer is my life is threatened and in the absence of firearms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2623.2s	2623.2	 I have no right to pull a gun and that's the case in like the uk for example where there are like no police officer shootings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2629.6s	2629.6	 Of civilians because they're never under threat of being killed by a gun
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2634.4s	2634.4	 So there's a simple answer which is get rid of the guns, but you know a little too controversial and um, obviously many layers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2640.7s	2640.7	 Uh to that argument
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2642.7s	2642.7	 um, especially from kind of both sides, but I I would say um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2648.5s	2648.5	 You know much much of what's going to go on now and in the future. It's just chaos theory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2652.1s	2652.1	 It's going to be building more layers of complexity. It's more entropy. It's more kind of associated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2656.9s	2656.9	 Complexity to try and resolve the underlying problem of all of this which is that we've got guns on the streets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2661.4s	2661.4	 We've got guns in people's hands and therefore, you know, there's always this threat against every individual that their life might be taken by another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2669.2s	2669.2	 Well, let me make a prediction right now. There's not going to be any new gun control legislation for a generation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2675.8s	2675.8	 Because of the the looting and writing that's going on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2678.9s	2678.9	 On gun sales are at an all-time high. I mean every single gun store that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2684.4s	2684.4	 You can't you can't get guns you can't get ammo and there are more first-time gun buyers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2689.0s	2689.0	 In the united states in the last several months than there's ever been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2691.8s	2691.8	 Um, I mean the the ranks of the nra must just be swelling right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2696.0s	2696.0	 Um, and so this idea that you're going to get gun reform. I don't think it's going to happen people aren't going to support it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2702.9s	2702.9	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2703.7s	2703.7	 you know, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2706.1s	2706.1	 You know use the word I think idealistic, I mean I I think it's like a little bit naive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2711.2s	2711.2	 To assume that you're going to be able to get rid of all the guns in the hands of bad actors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2716.3s	2716.3	 There are a lot of people in this country who feel the need to have a gun to protect themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2721.8s	2721.8	 And you know, the cops can't always get there quickly enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2725.2s	2725.2	 Um, and a lot of people feel the need to to have that for self-defense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2729.1s	2729.1	 I also think the minimum amount of training for a police officer should not be six months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2732.6s	2732.6	 I think they have to re I mean if we really want to have the society move forward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2737.4s	2737.4	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2738.5s	2738.5	 You know to solve our issue of race, which is you know, like the original sydney of america
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2743.6s	2743.6	 We're going to really need to start thinking about making
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2747.1s	2747.1	 you know police go back to school for 18 months 12 months and rethink how we how we address the situation because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2753.6s	2753.6	 It's it's just tragically unfair that one group of people's children
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2757.6s	2757.6	 Has to worry when they're driving in a car and you know other people on this call don't have to worry, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2762.5s	2762.5	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2763.5s	2763.5	 You know, uh, that is just crazy. Let's um, take a hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2768.6s	2768.6	 Shift to the economy and then we'll go into um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2772.0s	2772.0	 The election what do you think trumoff? You've been talking a little bit about the economy and the stock market ripping again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2777.8s	2777.8	 And we seem to have hit a pause
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2780.2s	2780.2	 But we did have like a massive rip with tesla and amazon tesla and apple. I guess doing a stock split
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2786.3s	2786.3	 And we hit all-time records. Why are we hitting all-time records trumoff?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2789.8s	2789.8	 We have the most important thing that's happened I think in economics in the last 10 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2795.6s	2795.6	 Um the federal reserve jaron powell gave this landmark speech and he basically said we are going to keep rates at zero for the next half decade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2803.9s	2803.9	 Uh basically and quite a few years at zero. Yeah, I mean quite honestly it's could it could be a decade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2809.7s	2809.7	 But they're gonna let inflation run
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2812.7s	2812.7	 Before they basically match it with rates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2814.9s	2814.9	 I mean match it with rates. There's no path to any near-term inflation of any kind whatsoever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2821.1s	2821.1	 um, and so jason my my honest perspective is you know, uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2826.2s	2826.2	 you're basically going to get paid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2828.8s	2828.8	 to be long equities because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2831.8s	2831.8	 Uh, your risk-free rate is zero and will soon be negative and what are you supposed to do if you're an asset manager?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2838.4s	2838.4	 What are you supposed to do with you know, your take california back to using california?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2842.7s	2842.7	 Let's just say you're calpers. You're the california pension
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2846.0s	2846.0	 system and you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2847.6s	2847.6	 Hundreds of billions of dollars then you need to generate five or six percent a year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2853.2s	2853.2	 To make sure that your pension isn't insolvent and the government is paying you zero
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2859.6s	2859.6	 Okay, so that eliminates that option. No treasuries for you your long equities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2864.4s	2864.4	 Um, and when everybody is in that situation your overwhelmingly long equities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2869.6s	2869.6	 And you know the you cannot fight the fed and so you cannot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2874.3s	2874.3	 Wait them out. It's not like you can say oh don't worry. They're going to change their mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2877.9s	2877.9	 uh, they will change their mind but in reaction to market conditions that are out of your control, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2882.4s	2882.4	 uh all of these opportunities in my opinion are generally buying opportunities and uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2888.8s	2888.8	 I'm generally bullish. I'm more bullish now than I was before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2892.5s	2892.5	 So you can't put your money into treasuries. You can't put it into a savings account. Obviously you can't put it you you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2898.4s	2898.4	 It doesn't seem like real estate or commercial real estate. It's a great bet right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2904.0s	2904.0	 So your options are private companies or public companies, correct? Jemma
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2909.2s	2909.2	 I think it really is just public companies and I don't even think it's private companies. So meaning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2914.4s	2914.4	 Wherever capital is constrained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2917.5s	2917.5	 The returns, um again, these excess returns are getting eaten up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2921.6s	2921.6	 Um, and so the the most unimpeded market for gains right now is the public markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2926.6s	2926.6	 I mean like no offense, but I think that if you were a very good stock picker in the public markets, you're generating better returns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2932.5s	2932.5	 then uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2933.4s	2933.4	 Sequoia benchmark name your best venture fund, you know, I see all these people spouting off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2938.7s	2938.7	 Uh on twitter about how good they are in the early stage markets. It's all kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2942.9s	2942.9	 Small dollars and not that meaningful, you know, i'm on the call, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2949.6s	2949.6	 I'm on the call. I mean you're literally talking to the guy spouting off about hitting over us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2955.0s	2955.0	 Sax what are your thoughts on this like private markets obviously is the op where we operate both david's freiburg and sax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2961.3s	2961.3	 Um, and you're seeing great deals. I think i'm i've invested in twice as many companies during the pandemic as I did before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2967.2s	2967.2	 In the same six-month period what are you seeing in the private markets? And what do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2970.6s	2970.6	 What is your take on bestie sees public markets?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2973.6s	2973.6	 you know, we saw some of the best deals that we've seen during covet and um, you know, i'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2979.4s	2979.4	 I'm very bullish about the state of entrepreneurship in the u.s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2983.6s	2983.6	 I mean just the the number of interesting companies doing interesting things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2987.8s	2987.8	 And the the infrastructure that makes it so easy for founders to get started and create new companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2993.3s	2993.3	 It's so much easier now to create a to create a company than it was 10 years or 20 years ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=2999.2s	2999.2	 and of course, it's easy to point to all the ones that don't work or that don't seem like good ideas, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3003.4s	3003.4	 Uh, but there's so many more experiments that are happening and I think that's gonna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3007.2s	3007.2	 You know, i'm very bullish about that part of the the american economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3011.0s	3011.0	 Uh and freeberg, what are your thoughts on private markets and obviously you're building private companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3016.0s	3016.0	 You have unlimited capital to build them. I take it, uh given your track record
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3020.8s	3020.8	 I spend most of my time accepting rejections from my very close investor friends in my various projects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3026.6s	3026.6	 So, um, I wouldn't say that that ever becomes true. I'll tell you the truth. Uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3031.1s	3031.1	 i'm still selling every day dialing for dollars, but um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3035.1s	3035.1	 No, there are certainly more investors more capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3038.3s	3038.3	 Uh more risk taking um more kind of valuation extending than I think has um, it was the case
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3045.2s	3045.2	 Pre-covid I think chamath's point is right though. There is uh, so so much more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3051.3s	3051.3	 liquidity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3052.6s	3052.6	 Available through access to retail and international market participants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3057.6s	3057.6	 Um in in a public setting than there is in a private setting and it is because of this liquidity premium and the easy access to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3063.8s	3063.8	 putting capital in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3065.3s	3065.3	 Um, it's just extraordinary how much as i've watched close friends and companies and companies i've invested in i'm sure you guys have done the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3072.3s	3072.3	 transition from private to public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3074.5s	3074.5	 Uh, the valuation jump is extraordinary like uh on on a metric basis, right? So whatever the metric might be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3081.2s	3081.2	 You get public there is this flurry of of market participation as a result. It drives up. There's a multiple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3087.6s	3087.6	 Your beast sorry, can I just say something that's such a such an important smart thing that freeberg said so jason for example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3094.4s	3094.4	 Like all of us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3095.8s	3095.8	 We're all still in the private markets and i'm not trying to take away from the private markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3099.4s	3099.4	 But what david said is so important if you used to look at a sas deal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3102.9s	3102.9	 You'd price that sas deal 10 times arr, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3106.1s	3106.1	 Then there's a little bit of inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3108.2s	3108.2	 You know, uh the rates go up. Um, the prices that people pay go up now all of a sudden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3113.1s	3113.1	 We're paying 12 times 15 times now. It's 20 times if you're growing 100 rate over year. So what's happened?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3119.1s	3119.1	 The market has become more efficient and the excess return is getting eaten up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3123.6s	3123.6	 And so you're like, okay. Well, that's still really good and you wait four five six years and you think you're gonna get paid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3129.6s	3129.6	 The crazy thing is like once that company transitions to the public markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3134.0s	3134.0	 I mean all of a sudden if you actually turn the investor base over and you actually create a float so that public market guys can buy it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3141.1s	3141.1	 They'll pay 30 times. That's right 35 times 40 times. So there's a massive multiple expansion. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3147.3s	3147.3	 Companies should be going public sooner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3150.0s	3150.0	 If you think about this like if i'm trying to raise money for one of my companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3153.7s	3153.7	 I'm going to call on my 10 20 30 friends that I know that are investors in private markets and say hey guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3158.8s	3158.8	 Do you want to look at this company?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3160.4s	3160.4	 And maybe i'll get two or three interested parties and maybe we'll kind of agree on what a fair valuation would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3165.3s	3165.3	 If I could take that same company and instantly make it available to a million investors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3169.6s	3169.6	 And all I need to do by the way is raise 10 million dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3172.4s	3172.4	 All I need is some small number of them to write a couple hundred dollar check
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3176.2s	3176.2	 And i'm able to fill that that round out the valuation as a result of the liquidity available in that market is so much higher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3183.1s	3183.1	 Because everyone's gonna there's gonna be much more participation in bidding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3186.4s	3186.4	 and so, you know what I think chamath has tapped into with the spat vehicle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3191.0s	3191.0	 And um what robin hood is realizing and and I don't think that we all talk about this enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3195.7s	3195.7	 But there's this massive massive massive market of international investors of small of international retail investors who are now rushing into u.s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3204.5s	3204.5	 equities freeburg didn't we see that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3207.2s	3207.2	 In the ico craze as well where you you I think if we took anything from the ico craze
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3212.4s	3212.4	 It was and the global appetite for risk and the dot-com boom before that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3216.4s	3216.4	 And I think we have to give bestie see a lot of credit here for leading the spack movement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3219.8s	3219.8	 I mean, what's your take on everybody copying you down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3222.7s	3222.7	 The spack path chamath at this point. I had desktop metal as an early angel investment that just spacked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3227.7s	3227.7	 Um, and then I've been I let I co-led the play. Thank you. Yeah, and then they told me that thank you for the markup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3232.8s	3232.8	 Um, and i've been hearing like i'm i'm getting if i'm getting inbound as an angel investor from I literally got a cold email
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3239.4s	3239.4	 From some high profile people and they're like, hey, can you do you have anything for us to spack?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3243.6s	3243.6	 I mean, this is like the third or fourth time people are coming down to my dipshit level of angel investing saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3248.0s	3248.0	 Can you introduce us to the calm guys? Can you choose to rob it? I'm like, I think you can go direct to them, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3253.8s	3253.8	 What is your take on how many spacks have been created since you like literally single-handedly restarted the spack movement?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3260.8s	3260.8	 I think because you don't think you've ever gone on record about this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3263.9s	3263.9	 Uh, i'm really proud of what we did when we created this thing two years ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3267.6s	3267.6	 I said I want to basically create a new way of doing ipos. I called it ipo 2.0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3272.1s	3272.1	 I reserved ipo a through z on the nyse. I I hope um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3278.0s	3278.0	 Uh to fulfill that um, and I think I will um, but taking a step back for a second
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3283.9s	3283.9	 In the year 2000 there were 8 000 public companies in america on the american stock exchanges
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3290.3s	3290.3	 And in the year 2020 there are 4 000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3293.5s	3293.5	 So we've shrunk in half the number of public companies while at the same time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3298.9s	3298.9	 We've you know 10 x the amount of the amount of capital and the number of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3304.2s	3304.2	 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3305.3s	3305.3	 We don't have a large enough surface area in the public markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3308.9s	3308.9	 That's why companies are better off going public because they're going to have a much more receptive audience of people that are dying to own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3316.9s	3316.9	 Growth of any kind what's the earliest and the median that people should go public?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3321.0s	3321.0	 Well, so so here's the thing so like if you're like one of 30 companies in a venture portfolio that's growing at 50 plus percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3329.2s	3329.2	 You're one of 30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3330.8s	3330.8	 But when you go public you're one of one, you know when you're growing 50 60 percent you you become very unique
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3337.6s	3337.6	 All of a sudden you're a sort of a one percent kind of a company. You're an outlier and so you get treated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3343.6s	3343.6	 You know incredibly well, so that's the backdrop I think a company should be going public around year five year six
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3351.1s	3351.1	 Um, what revenue footprint about 50 million, you know at 50 million and what they're doubling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3356.4s	3356.4	 I think that they should be going up and you know, it allows them to build capital slowly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3360.8s	3360.8	 It allows them to basically contain control. It minimizes dilution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3365.2s	3365.2	 Um, I think it's a really powerful model and then on on the number of SPACs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3369.3s	3369.3	 What I would say is I think it's really good that the market is getting diversified
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3373.2s	3373.2	 I think what's going to happen is like the the thing with SPACs is it's going to be no different than in some ways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3379.8s	3379.8	 The banks that preceded us which is that there's going to be a distribution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3383.6s	3383.6	 You can go to Goldman Sachs and that'll mean some one thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3387.6s	3387.6	 You can go to meryl lynch or b of a or ubs or jeffries. It'll mean other things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3392.4s	3392.4	 You can go to alan and company. It'll mean yet another different set of things and i'm sure there's going to be a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3397.7s	3397.7	 You know an organization that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3399.9s	3399.9	 Uh is all about cost that some is going to be all about relationships some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3404.7s	3404.7	 So I just think that's going to be the distribution my personal perspective. It's probably us and maybe one or two other people who really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3412.3s	3412.3	 Dominate the space and i'll and i'll tell you the only reason why I say that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3416.0s	3416.0	 I think it's going to be really important when these people try to get these SPACs done what they're going to realize is it's really hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3421.6s	3421.6	 And it's hard for a couple reasons. Number one is you have to marry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3425.9s	3425.9	 operational insight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3428.1s	3428.1	 and public market sophistication
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3430.4s	3430.4	 And the founder will get really smart about being able to figure out whether this person is just a financial arbitrager
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3436.1s	3436.1	 Or if the person has enough operational experience to deeply understand the business why you have to translate it to the public markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3443.4s	3443.4	 Well, that's one huge thing that I think that people will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3447.2s	3447.2	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3448.4s	3448.4	 We'll start to we'll start to hone in on. Um, anyways, there's a bunch of other things but um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3453.5s	3453.5	 Are you now competing with I want to hear for the sex does sax agree with the 50 million?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3458.4s	3458.4	 Yeah, sure. Um, i'm i'm cool with that, you know, I invest well before that so i'd be i'd be happy for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3463.8s	3463.8	 You probably have a bigger portfolio of 50 million dollar. Yeah, it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3467.7s	3467.7	 It's great for for for me and jason and I you know, I I think jamoth deserves a ton of credit on on this whole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3473.2s	3473.2	 SPAC thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3474.1s	3474.1	 It is I don't know if all the listeners are aware of this but the SPAC things become a huge wave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3479.3s	3479.3	 Um, there's a ton of people creating them kevin hearts has a new one reed hoffman has a new one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3484.4s	3484.4	 They're you know, the east coast hedge fund guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3486.8s	3486.8	 Pinkus and um, and then the east coast hedge funds like bill ackman, wherever they're all creating them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3491.6s	3491.6	 So tramatha has really started a wave here and I think the appeal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3495.5s	3495.5	 Of a SPAC to a founder i'll put in a plug of why I think it's a good idea for a founder to consider this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3500.8s	3500.8	 Is because you essentially what what founders are used to is doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3505.6s	3505.6	 You know private rounds right you agree on a on an amount raise and evaluation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3510.3s	3510.3	 And it's a percent dilution and you're done. That's it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3513.2s	3513.2	 And that's simple right and and when you ipo and need to raise money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3517.4s	3517.4	 It's not like that. You have to then work with an investment bank
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3520.1s	3520.1	 They'll put together a book you do like a road show you do this whole dog and pony thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3524.4s	3524.4	 You don't know how much money you're going to get at the end of that process or what the valuation is going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3528.8s	3528.8	 And then on top of that, we know statistically bill girly's published all the stats the investment banks are going to rip you off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3535.4s	3535.4	 So, you know so that what a SPAC does is it prices like a late stage private round you just agree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3542.5s	3542.5	 With the SPAC motor on evaluation and amount raised and then on top of it you get kind of a direct listing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3549.2s	3549.2	 Along with it. Now all of a sudden you start trading as a public company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3552.8s	3552.8	 And so a SPAC is like a combination direct listing plus private round
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3557.4s	3557.4	 And I think that's going to be appealing to a lot of founders as they start to discover this more and more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3562.5s	3562.5	 Sax in a way you're saying it's going to feel more like doing a series d
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3565.7s	3565.7	 Than it does a road show and I think that comfort level
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3569.7s	3569.7	 For somebody like robin hood or com or data stacks or thumbtack or any of these companies that you and I are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3576.2s	3576.2	 Every company in your portfolio. I'm just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3579.1s	3579.1	 Listen, I got two ipos in two years. This is I think this is going to be the new thing for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3585.1s	3585.1	 Early stage investors is we're not going to count unicorns anymore. We're going to count SPACs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3588.8s	3588.8	 We're going to count public listings right and and I think that's probably better by the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3592.7s	3592.7	 The other the other thing that i'll say to founders is one is I think you need to you need to think about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3598.7s	3598.7	 Do these people have?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3601.3s	3601.3	 The combination of operational and financial acumen in the public markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3606.3s	3606.3	 um and investing experience in the public markets and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3611.6s	3611.6	 Operational credibility to describe the business and I think you can trade off one for the other if one is so deep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3617.3s	3617.3	 Meaning if oren buffett was doing his back, you'd say well, he has no operational experience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3621.6s	3621.6	 But he's so credible in the public markets then you know, that's all that matters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3626.5s	3626.5	 But you need to be super super deep in one or have a really brilliant and thoughtful level of credibility in the publics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3632.7s	3632.7	 Meaning an early stage investor who isn't married to somebody who can basically say I know how hedge funds work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3638.4s	3638.4	 I've made them money and i'm going to make them more money and mutual funds, etc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3642.6s	3642.6	 Is troublesome the second thing is for founders you have to really make sure you understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3647.6s	3647.6	 What is in it for the person that's doing this back?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3650.7s	3650.7	 I mean in every deal I write a minimum of a hundred million dollars personally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3656.1s	3656.1	 And that's a lot and so I skim in the game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3658.9s	3658.9	 I feel very much at risk and so I take a lot of time to make sure these things go well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3663.5s	3663.5	 And then the third is that for the SPAC person what i'll tell them is they are going to find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3668.4s	3668.4	 That there's a bunch of landmines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3670.4s	3670.4	 Um, and i'm not gonna, you know say it up front because I think it'll be fun for them to find out themselves along the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3676.9s	3676.9	 Uh, but they're but these things are hard. The first one took me two and a half years. Uh, they're hard. Yeah, they're hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3682.9s	3682.9	 They're hard. Hey, let's uh swing to the election now. Um and uh talk a little bit about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3689.1s	3689.1	 The flip-flopping we're all doing because we've gone from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3693.0s	3693.0	 Trump's a lock to trump's not a lock, you know, and we've had many different theories, but here we are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3698.2s	3698.2	 Uh, are we 60 days out now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3700.4s	3700.4	 How many days till the election is it exactly 60 and then the first debate is september 29th? Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3705.2s	3705.2	 Yeah, so we're we're at the 55 or 56 days mark the taping of this and the first debate I think is september 30th
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3711.5s	3711.5	 So we're we're we're but three weeks away from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3714.5s	3714.5	 Joe biden and trump going at it. What's everybody's handicapping now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3719.2s	3719.2	 The the mark the markets seem to be saying even money or a slight edge to joe biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3725.2s	3725.2	 Uh, what are our thoughts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3727.6s	3727.6	 I uh, I think that uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3730.4s	3730.4	 I think biden's looked the crispest he's looked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3735.0s	3735.0	 Okay, so um, is that actually encouraging or not encouraging?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3739.2s	3739.2	 I think it really is because I think he's a really good. Like I said, he doesn't have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3744.4s	3744.4	 Uh be better than donald trump. He just has to not be donald trump for a lot of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3749.3s	3749.3	 And so, you know, he becomes a very good do no harm alternative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3753.9s	3753.9	 Because you know to support donald trump you have to have a view to support joe biden you can have no view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3761.1s	3761.1	 Um, and I think that that in general that's a that's a demand maximizing thing to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3766.5s	3766.5	 So I think he's relatively well positioned. It's the crispest i've ever seen him on television. There's less stuttering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3773.6s	3773.6	 There's less not stuttering but like less like mental gaps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3777.7s	3777.7	 you know the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3779.2s	3779.2	 What do you think of the vp choice kamala?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3782.1s	3782.1	 Make safe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3783.3s	3783.3	 So I I agree with tramath that that was kind of the the take or theory on biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3788.9s	3788.9	 Like a month or two ago is that he could just run as a protest vote against trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3793.2s	3793.2	 um, and um, and and that's why the basement strategy appeared to make sense is that he would say nothing do nothing go nowhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3800.9s	3800.9	 And just and just try to run as a protest vote against trump and I think that was working
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3806.1s	3806.1	 A couple of months ago when you know a covid seemed a lot worse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3810.5s	3810.5	 Be the economy seemed a lot worse. We're now down to about eight percent unemployment. We were at 13 or 14 percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3817.7s	3817.7	 um, and uh c you know trump had seemed to kind of mishandle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3823.5s	3823.5	 The the reaction to to floyd he seemed to be inciting it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3826.6s	3826.6	 But now we have this this issue of the the looting and violence and predominantly democrat-run cities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3832.5s	3832.5	 And I think you know trump has sort of found his sales pitch now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3836.2s	3836.2	 um in opposing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3838.6s	3838.6	 The the basically the the the radical left and these these mobs and protests that seem to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3847.2s	3847.2	 You know causing a tremendous unrest and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3851.7s	3851.7	 Looting and violence in our cities and I think it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3854.7s	3854.7	 I think it's a in combination with the improving conditions of the economy and covid. I think it's a winning pitch for him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3861.3s	3861.3	 Unless biden finds a more compelling way of responding which he has not to date
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3866.7s	3866.7	 Um, I think you know somebody like bill clinton would know exactly how to respond. I think he would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3871.9s	3871.9	 You know in the better instincts. Yeah. Well, I think you know, he would pull a sister soldier to use a term from the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3877.4s	3877.4	 the you know political dictionary where you know, maybe he would take this crazy new book in defense of looting and figure out you know and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3884.1s	3884.1	 Give a speech denouncing that I mean he would find somebody to his left who represents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3889.2s	3889.2	 You know a fringe of the the left that he presumably doesn't support and find a way to distance himself or denounce them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3895.3s	3895.3	 Like and he hasn't maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3897.1s	3897.1	 Like antifa like, you know the anyone, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3900.5s	3900.5	 Any of the left-wing in portland looting in portland. I think there's a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3904.5s	3904.5	 Target, nobody wants to see nobody wants to support that and so biden comes out and says hey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3907.9s	3907.9	 We don't support that and it gives him that law and order vote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3911.2s	3911.2	 But and he hasn't done he hasn't really done that. I mean, so two of my favorite political pundits right now are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3916.1s	3916.1	 andrew sullivan and matt, uh, taibbi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3918.9s	3918.9	 Who are you know very?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3921.2s	3921.2	 Uh, they're they're strong supporters of biden. They're very anti trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3924.8s	3924.8	 But they think he's failing on sort of this these issues because he's not he's not figuring out the right way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3931.8s	3931.8	 to uh to denounce what's happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3934.5s	3934.5	 I think a lot of this has to do with when kids go back to school and the death rate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3938.2s	3938.2	 uh of covid and as I was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3941.6s	3941.6	 Tweeting and I got a lot of people angry at me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3945.3s	3945.3	 About tweeting this but I said, I think this is a setup for trump to go into the first debate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3949.8s	3949.8	 With you know, well under you know, six seven hundred deaths a day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3953.8s	3953.8	 And then the next debate in october with you know, call it three or four hundred deaths a day and basically declare that he did solve covid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3960.4s	3960.4	 Um, because we've been trending down for five weeks now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3963.6s	3963.6	 And he started wearing a mask five six weeks ago seven weeks ago july 11th was the first day he wore a mask a cynic would say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3969.7s	3969.7	 He almost timed mask wearing which is obviously what we talked about in the first episode or two of all in podcast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3976.6s	3976.6	 Was our discussion about why is wearing a mask so difficult for him?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3980.2s	3980.2	 And it seems like he slow played it. He you know, he set he he slow played
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3985.0s	3985.0	 He hit his set on the turn and here he is like he wore the mask on july 11th
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3989.2s	3989.2	 He wore it four months late
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3990.3s	3990.3	 But guess what as chumoth was saying everybody wears a mask and every and and these things go down in italy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=3996.7s	3996.7	 We're going to come into the first debate. What if it's 400 deaths a day and then the second debate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4000.7s	4000.7	 It's 200 deaths a day and then our kids are back in school in october
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4004.3s	4004.3	 Which it seems to be the case, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4006.1s	4006.1	 All the schools are saying, you know be ready for october to open
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4008.8s	4008.8	 And what if he actually does have a vaccine that has somewhat of credibility or any of these high speed testing machines come on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4014.8s	4014.8	 I mean this could be a setup of all setups for him to just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4018.0s	4018.0	 You know drop the microphone. Hey, look the economy has had an all-time high and covid deaths are at an all-time low
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4024.2s	4024.2	 Well, I mean, yeah, I think democratic cities are on fire that to me seems like the the trajectory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4029.1s	4029.1	 I mean, um, we spent a long time on this pod talking about what a disaster
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4033.6s	4033.6	 Uh san francisco and california are those are one party states and cities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4039.1s	4039.1	 And I think you know, we're not just electing a person as president
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4042.1s	4042.1	 We're also electing a party and a movement and a governing philosophy and however much uh trump is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4050.1s	4050.1	 You know disliked by a lot of people. I think a lot of people are looking at you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4054.5s	4054.5	 I think they they they may like joe biden personally and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4057.6s	4057.6	 And think that he personally is safe, but they don't like the movement and the party and the governing philosophy that is now associated with biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4064.9s	4064.9	 So if you had to put your entire net worth on it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4071.5s	4071.5	 uh biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4072.5s	4072.5	 I think biden's good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4074.1s	4074.1	 sax entire net worth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4076.5s	4076.5	 I I I would uh, I predict trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4079.5s	4079.5	 At this moment you predict but you but you wouldn't put your entire net worth on if you had to I could see your hesitation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4084.9s	4084.9	 You want trump trump to win sure but you would you wouldn't put you wouldn't put your entire net worth on him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4089.7s	4089.7	 Oh, yeah, of course not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4091.2s	4091.2	 You would put it on this is this is about a 55 percent sort of thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4096.1s	4096.1	 So biden has a 55 chance of winning. So even though you're voting for trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4099.8s	4099.8	 You are not going you would not put your fortune on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4103.5s	4103.5	 Biden you you asked me who I predict right now. I'm predicting trump. You'll remember on the last pod
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4108.3s	4108.3	 I predicted biden so it moves depending on what I see happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4112.4s	4112.4	 Yeah, and I i'm gonna go with biden by the way jason jason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4115.6s	4115.6	 I think I think a better way to get a better answer is not to force somebody to put their entire net worth on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4119.8s	4119.8	 The line is just to say who do you think is gonna win? Who do you think is gonna win sax?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4125.5s	4125.5	 How many times I have to answer this question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4127.5s	4127.5	 You think trump's gonna win you actually yes. Yes, I do actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4131.5s	4131.5	 Really?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4132.4s	4132.4	 Yeah, it's fascinating. Huh? And it's free remember. Remember it's the first time i've said this here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4136.8s	4136.8	 I think it's I think it's the same as it was last time for me and it has been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4140.8s	4140.8	 Most of this process is it's a coin flip and it still is a coin flip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4145.2s	4145.2	 And uh, there's a lot of noise between here and 60 days from here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4149.3s	4149.3	 All right. Well, then if we if we do think it's a coin flip freeburg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4152.3s	4152.3	 What happens if trump is elected again? Some people think this is all institutions are broken forever america's broken forever hyperbolic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4159.7s	4159.7	 That's that's the perception on both sides, right? So the perception and the motivation on both sides is democracy is crumbling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4166.5s	4166.5	 And the resultant action is to elect the the person you think will restore democracy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4172.1s	4172.1	 the reality is both candidates to some degree might move us a little bit further away from democracy and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4178.7s	4178.7	 Some might argue that trump makes us feel a little bit more like an autocratic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4183.3s	4183.3	 Dictatorial regime and some might say that biden makes us feel a little bit more like an aoc socialist regime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4188.8s	4188.8	 it's not all the way as if we have bernie in the seat, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4191.4s	4191.4	 Um, you know the the reaction uh, isn't necessarily let's go back to the middle. Let's become a centrist government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4197.5s	4197.5	 Let's uh, let's have good political debate and a good by the way the one show i've been watching a lot of lately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4202.7s	4202.7	 Just to nostalgia to chamath's tweet earlier today and make me feel better about life is west wing where you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4208.9s	4208.9	 Jed bartlett is the president and he wants a great national debate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4212.5s	4212.5	 We all want to have this intellectual exercise of coming to the truth and coming to the best decision for the nation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4217.6s	4217.6	 And I don't think anyone feels like that's the case today nor will that be the case tomorrow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4222.1s	4222.1	 With either of these guys in the seat and I think the the point then becomes well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4225.9s	4225.9	 Who's gonna better align with my values?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4228.5s	4228.5	 And you know, um, it is really a crumbling democracy kind of motivation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4232.4s	4232.4	 I would guess if you were to survey people as to how they're making their choice if trump is elected freberg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4237.6s	4237.6	 Do you feel it is an acute, you know existential crisis for america as a democracy you personally?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4243.2s	4243.2	 I don't I don't think democracies and um with a bang
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4246.5s	4246.5	 I think they end with a whimper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4248.5s	4248.5	 And I think that's been the case historically and you know, no democracy has uh has lasted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4255.4s	4255.4	 Our democracy in the u.s. Has has lasted longer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4259.3s	4259.3	 uh than many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4260.6s	4260.6	 um, but democracies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4262.6s	4262.6	 I'll just tell you my my point of view on this democracies ultimately enable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4266.6s	4266.6	 uh freedom of operation and free markets that um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4269.6s	4269.6	 That result in in greater progress than any other governing system. The problem with progress is that progress is asymmetric
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4276.4s	4276.4	 You have some people who progress at a much greater rate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4279.4s	4279.4	 Than than than most and and it is that delta that motivates the end of that system ultimately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4286.3s	4286.3	 um while everyone in the united states or the average and even the bottom quartile of the population in the u.s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4291.7s	4291.7	 Is better off than they were 50 years ago in terms of income and health care and shelter and access to food and access to all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4296.8s	4296.8	 these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4297.9s	4297.9	 There the top one percent of the u.s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4299.7s	4299.7	 Is further ahead than the median and it is that delta that motivates the end of democracy and it is that is which is then perceived
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4305.7s	4305.7	 To be unfair about this governing system and that ultimately results in fascism or socialism and then fascism results socialism ultimately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4313.7s	4313.7	 Restricts anyone from progression and that's why fascism and socialism ultimately end up in in in some sort of you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4320.0s	4320.0	 Democratic outcome and it is a cycle and you know, we're kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4323.7s	4323.7	 In this, you know awkward phase of trying to figure out what the hell we're going to be next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4327.5s	4327.5	 And I don't think that awkward phase. Um, it's realized in the next presidential term, but it is going to be realized in our lifetime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4332.8s	4332.8	 I think that that's a really good point. I completely agree with that

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4356.2s	4356.2	 I've been subscribing to a lot of newsletters on sub stack. Yeah, and I found that to be pretty interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4362.0s	4362.0	 And like I mentioned two of my favorite writers, especially around, um, you know politics and election time andrew solvent

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4384.5s	4384.5	 All all my favorite writers seem to have been canceled at some previous publication and now they've set themselves up on sub stack. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4391.0s	4391.0	 It is amazing how the overton window has closed

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4406.8s	4406.8	 Of american capitalism told in chapters for every call it like, you know five to seven or ten year a decade period

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4432.5s	4432.5	 I also watched one of my favorite top five films of all time. There will be blood by um, paul tony sandson
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4438.9s	4438.9	 Such a good film that opening scene is just crazy every opening scene. It's just such a beautiful film
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4444.7s	4444.7	 I got me down. Yeah, it got me down this research path on the standard oil company and I ended up um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4450.9s	4450.9	 First off I ended up reading all mario putz's godfather
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4454.5s	4454.5	 Which is very graphic and interesting, but if you've seen the movie, I don't think you get much more from the book
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4458.7s	4458.7	 um

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4472.4s	4472.4	 It's detailed so it's not you know, it's it's not probably um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4475.7s	4475.7	 You won't gain as much from it as perhaps reading a wikipedia article
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4479.4s	4479.4	 But uh the standard oil the the era if you think about what technology is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uf-F0ssFP0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=137&t=4483.9s	4483.9	 What we call technology in the u.s today in our world and and it's mostly software and now
