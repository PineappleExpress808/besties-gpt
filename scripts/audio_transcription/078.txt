https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=276.0s	276.0	 I saw your comment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=277.0s	277.0	 No, that's a no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=278.6s	278.6	 I get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=279.4s	279.4	 I reviewed the table where you listed all your results and I actually sent it to my team.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=283.6s	283.6	 I was like, this is a really nice way of summarizing a firm's results over a long period of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=289.4s	289.4	 because you had every fund and your totals and all the key metrics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=295.8s	295.8	 Well, can I talk about that for a second?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=297.3s	297.3	 Yes, please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=298.2s	298.2	 What's incredible about what you're saying, Sax, is I was interested in a bunch of other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=302.8s	302.8	 funds that I'm invested in and their returns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=305.6s	305.6	 And then I've also seen a bunch of leaked fundraising decks of all kinds of other firms,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=310.0s	310.0	 from growth stage to crossover to PE.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=312.9s	312.9	 And it's incredible that they are not standardized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=316.7s	316.7	 Some people only show gross IRR.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=319.1s	319.1	 Some people show net IRR.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=321.0s	321.0	 Some people don't show the total value of the paid in capital, which means
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=325.4s	325.4	 if you have a hundred dollar fund, what is the total value of all of its holdings?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=329.4s	329.4	 Some people don't show DPI, which is distributions of paid in capital, which means,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=334.2s	334.2	 okay, for every dollar you've taken in, how many dollars have you sent up?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=337.1s	337.1	 If you don't show all of them, what was shocking to me is how much you can kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=342.7s	342.7	 hide and play and manipulate the numbers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=346.1s	346.1	 And one of the most crazy things that I saw is that there are these late stage funds that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=351.0s	351.0	 right into their fundraising decks, that what they actually use are lines of credit to juice IRR.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=358.2s	358.2	 So what they do is if they're about to do a deal, they'll actually get a loan from a bank,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=364.2s	364.2	 put that money into a company, wait until it's about to get marked up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=369.1s	369.1	 And then what they do is they actually call that original money from their LPs and pay back their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=373.3s	373.3	 capital call line of credit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=374.4s	374.4	 So what does it do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=375.1s	375.1	 It inflates IRR.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=377.3s	377.3	 But this is why if you see the other numbers, it still shows that it's kind of like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=382.4s	382.4	 not doing much of anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=383.4s	383.4	 So if you ever see multi hundred percent IRRs or high huge IRRs with zero DPI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=391.0s	391.0	 and a marginal TVPI, it's folks that are playing games to trick LPs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=396.8s	396.8	 Just a heads up to everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=397.6s	397.6	 That is so weird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=398.6s	398.6	 So what you're saying is just to summarize for people in the audience who don't understand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=401.8s	401.8	 hey, we get judged on the rate of return each year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=404.6s	404.6	 So if the stock market does seven or eight percent, we're expected to do triple that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=407.8s	407.8	 So we've got to hit 20, 25 percent each year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=410.6s	410.6	 Now the clock starts ticking when the money gets called from the LPs, the partners,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=415.7s	415.7	 and gets put into the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=417.2s	417.2	 So if you invest in your tour of your fund, you pull the money down from the LPs, you put it into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=422.4s	422.4	 YouTube, whatever it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=423.8s	423.8	 What you're saying is they will take a loan against that future money from a bank at an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=427.9s	427.9	 absurdly low interest rate, let's say one percent or two percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=431.3s	431.3	 They make the YouTube investment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=433.3s	433.3	 Two years later, YouTube has a price round that marks it up 20 X.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=437.4s	437.4	 Then they put your cash in in year three of the fund, your back and pay back the loan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=442.6s	442.6	 Now they've paid two percent two years in a row, but the thing's gone up 20 X.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=447.2s	447.2	 Correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=448.3s	448.3	 What?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=449.8s	449.8	 That's dirty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=450.8s	450.8	 Well, so it's dirty enough that the SEC has actually now introduced legislation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=455.4s	455.4	 It was in February that basically is going to try to uncover all of this nonsense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=460.4s	460.4	 And so you'll have to be much more transparent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=462.5s	462.5	 So the format that I used, in my opinion, is the most transparent way of not being able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=467.0s	467.0	 hide the cheese.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=468.2s	468.2	 You show all the critical elements together in a simple table that will make it very obvious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=473.8s	473.8	 who's playing games and who can actually make money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=476.6s	476.6	 So there is a semi-legitimate version of the loan thing, which is where this comes from is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=483.4s	483.4	 a capital call loan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=484.8s	484.8	 So we're making a bunch of investments throughout the quarter, a million dollars here for a C deal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=489.1s	489.1	 10 million for a Series A.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=491.0s	491.0	 That's happening all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=491.8s	491.8	 You don't necessarily want to hit your LPs with capital calls for every single little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=495.3s	495.3	 small investment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=496.3s	496.3	 So what we do is you get a capital call line from SVB or something like that, and then you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=503.0s	503.0	 do one capital call per quarter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=505.9s	505.9	 And so they will loan you the money for one, two, three months, but it's not for a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=511.1s	511.1	 But the reality is if you have a reasonably well-developed infrastructure, you have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=515.1s	515.1	 cash forecast of what deals you may or may not close with probabilities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=518.7s	518.7	 And so you know what the weighted amount of capital you need to have on your balance sheet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=522.3s	522.3	 is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=522.4s	522.4	 So I agree with you to have a small amount at the edges to pay for expenses, to pay for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=527.0s	527.0	 salaries while you clean up at the end of a quarter, completely reasonable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=531.1s	531.1	 But if you're making five or 10% commitments into a company and you're using this as a way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=536.6s	536.6	 to basically create subterfuge and hide, I think that that should not be allowed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=541.4s	541.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=542.1s	542.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=542.2s	542.2	 The number of capital calls is annoying for people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=544.6s	544.6	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=545.1s	545.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=545.4s	545.4	 Anyway, I did share that table with our team too, because I did like the format quite a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=549.1s	549.1	 I booked one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=549.8s	549.8	 I think we'll start reading it this weekend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=551.7s	551.7	 It's very hard for funds who are not performant to use that format.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=556.0s	556.0	 You are very highly performant, so you can use that format.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=558.6s	558.6	 But I don't think people that have not returned money or have fake paper markups can use that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=563.1s	563.1	 format because it is too simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=565.4s	565.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=566.4s	566.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=567.3s	567.3	 At the end of the day, what metric do we all look at when we are LPs in a fund?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=574.1s	574.1	 Well, this is what I put down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=575.1s	575.1	 I put down the ones that I look at for everybody else that I'm an LP in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=578.6s	578.6	 So what one is that for you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=581.2s	581.2	 Multiple on cash investment?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=582.9s	582.9	 I need to look at the totality of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=584.8s	584.8	 I need to understand what is your gross and your net IRRs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=588.7s	588.7	 Those are important things to understand because it shows how efficiently you put the money to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=592.8s	592.8	 Of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=593.6s	593.6	 But then ultimately, then the other two things that really matter is what is the total value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=598.1s	598.1	 you've created and then what percentage of that have you given back to me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=602.5s	602.5	 Because that allows you to understand how much paper value this for example, today,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=609.2s	609.2	 let's just say you had a fund that had a TVPI total value of paid in capital of a 5x,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=615.0s	615.0	 a 5x on a fund is incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=617.6s	617.6	 But if you've distributed none of that, well, guess what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=620.6s	620.6	 If we're sitting here in May of 2023 or 2022, rather, the total value of your paid in capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=627.0s	627.0	 is not really 5x.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=628.2s	628.2	 It may be only 3x and it may be actually two and a half x considering what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=633.4s	633.4	 markets have done to these companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=635.8s	635.8	 And so it allows me to really understand how performant funds are in not just being a part
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=642.6s	642.6	 of the game, but actually generating realizations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=646.0s	646.0	 And this is the hardest part, as I told you, Jason, like this past quarter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=650.5s	650.5	 I think I passed 2x across my funds when I was managing outside capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=655.8s	655.8	 And I think my gosh, it took me 11 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=658.7s	658.7	 It's hard to return 2x the money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=660.9s	660.9	 And that means I've returned two and a half billion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=664.2s	664.2	 You know how hard that was?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=666.2s	666.2	 Yeah, I mean, you got to time the exit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=667.7s	667.7	 You have to have the ability to exit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=669.3s	669.3	 You can't even time the exit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=670.6s	670.6	 You have to you have to be constantly managing and working your portfolio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=674.1s	674.1	 Sometimes you're selling in secondary transactions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=677.0s	677.0	 Sometimes you're actually trading up in private markets where you help this company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=680.7s	680.7	 merge with another private company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=682.5s	682.5	 Other times, you know, if I think about it, the number of IPOs I've had is relatively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=686.6s	686.6	 diminutive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=687.0s	687.0	 So how do you make two billion dollars where I've only had one IPO, which has been slack?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=692.6s	692.6	 So this is a really, really hard business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=694.9s	694.9	 And it was just a reminder that, you know, in the last four or five years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=698.8s	698.8	 managing capital has seemed relatively easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=701.8s	701.8	 But in these next few years, you're going to see who's really, really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=704.4s	704.4	 It's kind of that old Warren Buffett quote, you know, you really,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=707.1s	707.1	 you know, you can see who's naked when the tide goes out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=709.7s	709.7	 I mean, said another way, the last five years, raising a fund has been really easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=714.1s	714.1	 And writing checks has been really easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=715.8s	715.8	 And now comes, you know, Act 3, which is returning a multiple on the money you easily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=721.1s	721.1	 collected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=721.6s	721.6	 And boy is that hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=722.6s	722.6	 And, you know, all of these new LPs, the other thing that I want to say is one thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=728.2s	728.2	 all these LPs send me even if I'm not an LP and a potential, they send potential
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=731.8s	731.8	 LPs their performance because they're so proud of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=733.8s	733.8	 Like quarterly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=735.0s	735.0	 I'm like, not even in this fund.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=736.3s	736.3	 And they have these crazy markups, crypto investments, this, whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=740.4s	740.4	 But they've returned no capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=741.8s	741.8	 And so it's like, just to give you a sense of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=744.7s	744.7	 If you, if you look at the most fantastic organization in the world, if it were an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=749.2s	749.2	 investment manager, which is Berkshire, their long run 50 year track record is, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=754.8s	754.8	 around 20%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=756.3s	756.3	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=757.0s	757.0	 Gross.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=757.9s	757.9	 If you look at the most successful asset manager in the world, and I would put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=761.3s	761.3	 Blackstone at that just incredibly good and best in class and probably three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=766.6s	766.6	 enormous parts of the worldwide economy, real estate, credit, and private equity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=773.0s	773.0	 you know, their long run track record is that on 200 and some odd billion dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=777.0s	777.0	 of private equity and another hundred billion dollars of, of, of real estate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=782.5s	782.5	 they've returned to X.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=784.1s	784.1	 So that's what the upper bound is, you know, doubling people's money and generating 15 to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=790.2s	790.2	 20% is the best you can expect if you are really excellent and long lived.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=796.2s	796.2	 That's the best.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=796.9s	796.9	 What do you look at Freeberg when you're an LP?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=799.0s	799.0	 What number do you care about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=800.3s	800.3	 Cause you LP other funds and I think all of us do at times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=803.5s	803.5	 I made my first venture fund investment in 2006 and I, I am still getting distributions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=814.3s	814.3	 from that fund and I'm looking at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=816.6s	816.6	 I'm like, this is a 2.4 X over that period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=820.2s	820.2	 I'm like, what the hell?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=821.4s	821.4	 Why did I even put this money into this fund?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=823.7s	823.7	 I guess this makes sense for pension funds and, you know, very large balance sheet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=828.5s	828.5	 long range investors that need to kind of diversify.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=831.4s	831.4	 But as an individual, I should have put my money and have had liquidity on it for 16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=837.2s	837.2	 years rather than have it locked up and a bunch of private companies sloshing around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=841.4s	841.4	 and make, you know, kind of dribble out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=842.7s	842.7	 And at the end of all this, I only get two and a half times my money back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=845.7s	845.7	 Two and a half times your money in 16 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=847.7s	847.7	 What's that IRR?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=848.6s	848.6	 It's like low teens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=850.0s	850.0	 Yeah. Not a great deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=850.9s	850.9	 No, it's lower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=852.7s	852.7	 You would have been better owning the S&P 500.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=854.7s	854.7	 That's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=855.6s	855.6	 And so for me, I think the key, the metric, the only metric that matters,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=859.8s	859.8	 which I think you're saying Chamath is how much cash I got out relative to cash I put in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=865.6s	865.6	 And so initially my IRR is negative 97%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=869.8s	869.8	 And then it goes up to negative 80 and then negative 60 and negative 30 and negative 20.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=874.4s	874.4	 And now it's 14% because I finally got more money out than I put in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=878.5s	878.5	 And so it doesn't feel to me like, you know, just generally private investing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=884.6s	884.6	 everyone gets excited because we all get sold stories and individuals all get sold stories of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=888.8s	888.8	 you put a dollar in, you get a hundred bucks in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=890.3s	890.3	 I mean, J Cal wrote a book called How I Made 100 Million Bucks from whatever you invested in Uber.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=895.9s	895.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=896.4s	896.4	 And that story, I think, gets everyone kind of excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=899.0s	899.0	 But the reality is the vast majority of the time, and if you diversify your bets like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=904.8s	904.8	 you're going to end up waiting a long time to get your money back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=908.0s	908.0	 You're going to be locked up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=909.4s	909.4	 And a top performing fund is returning two and a half X after 15 years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=914.2s	914.2	 which is not much better than kind of investing in the S&P,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=917.2s	917.2	 where you could sell that anytime you want and use that cash for any purpose you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=921.1s	921.1	 Well, if you did a hundred thousand dollar investment and you returned 260,000 in 15 years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=927.2s	927.2	 on an IRR calculator right now, internal rate of return, it's 6.58%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=931.6s	931.6	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=932.2s	932.2	 Better off than the S&P.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=934.3s	934.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=934.6s	934.6	 I mean, and if you did QQQQ, depending on, yeah, how hot the market was then.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=939.4s	939.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=940.0s	940.0	 And you get to sell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=940.7s	940.7	 It's really, really, really hard to actually make money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=944.4s	944.4	 There are always going to be periods where people look like geniuses and have markups,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=948.7s	948.7	 but you can really see when people have skill after a decade and a couple of up and down cycles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=953.6s	953.6	 Same with hedge funds, by the way, right? Hedge funds put up a score every year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=957.3s	957.3	 And in certain macro cycles that can last many, many years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=962.3s	962.3	 everyone looks like they're doing well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=965.1s	965.1	 And then all of a sudden tides go out and you lose more than you made over that period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=970.2s	970.2	 And then you realize, holy crap, I was actually in an insurance business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=973.8s	973.8	 where you get paid some small premium every year, and then you have some massive loss one year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=978.5s	978.5	 And that massive loss, it turns out your underwriting wasn't good because you lose more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=982.3s	982.3	 than the sum of all of the premium you collected over that period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=986.0s	986.0	 And unfortunately, a lot of investing looks like this, which is you have small returns,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=991.1s	991.1	 you have small returns for a long period of time, and then some massive loss.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=995.6s	995.6	 And the whole business makes you look like, along the way, a genius,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=999.8s	999.8	 but the reality is over any long cycle, most folks end up kind of in a bad position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1006.4s	1006.4	 The SEC, by the way, has solved this for mutual funds and ETFs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1014.5s	1014.5	 There's very strict standard reporting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1016.4s	1016.4	 And I do think that as, for example, if you go to the big banks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1020.6s	1020.6	 sorry, sex interrupt, I just want to finish the last thought.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1022.2s	1022.2	 If you go to the big banks, and you have, if you're an individual, like a doctor or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1026.4s	1026.4	 dentist or somebody, and they will aggregate and pool capital and put it into these funds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1031.6s	1031.6	 on your behalf as an example. So, you know, it looks like JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs is a,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1036.6s	1036.6	 you know, 50 or $100 million LP in one of these big funds. But in fact, it's just the sum of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1041.4s	1041.4	 a bunch of folks on their platform. It stands to reason that if the SEC can actually mandate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1047.0s	1047.0	 standardized reporting for private investing, it would actually be a really good thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1050.4s	1050.4	 because all of these games will and probably currently are, as far as I've seen in these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1056.2s	1056.2	 presentations, tricking a lot of folks to put their hard earned money into things that actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1061.1s	1061.1	 will never make money. And it's because if you selectively cherry pick how you present this data,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1066.4s	1066.4	 you can tell a partial truth. So, you know, I would really I would love I'm happy to be compared to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1072.1s	1072.1	 any organization. But every time I hear somebody chirping about how good they are, my only comment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1076.6s	1076.6	 is I just want to see your table in the same format as my table and we can compare it because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1080.7s	1080.7	 it allows me to really understand. Yeah, liquid returns. And by the way, the point I made earlier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1085.0s	1085.0	 about when markets are generally good, hedge fund public market investors generally can look like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1091.4s	1091.4	 they're doing well by having a good marginal return above the benchmark every year, and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1096.6s	1096.6	 one year have a big drawdown. And suddenly they realize that their underwriting wasn't that good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1101.1s	1101.1	 The same can be true in in private investing in the opposite way in the sense that you'll put in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1106.2s	1106.2	 small checks, small checks, and lose money and lose money and lose money and then have one big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1110.6s	1110.6	 banger and you get 100x return and you look like a genius because your whole portfolio looks good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1115.5s	1115.5	 But you fast forward and you keep doing that for another 10 years, all those small checks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1119.0s	1119.0	 may not even add up to the banger. And that's, that's the flip reality that you realize. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1123.9s	1123.9	 by the way, I think that's a good analogy for the difference between public and private investing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1127.7s	1127.7	 You have similar cash flow economics where you can have small returns and then a big loss in public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1131.8s	1131.8	 and you can have small losses and then a big return in private. And the timing of when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1135.9s	1135.9	 present your data can make anyone look good if you catch a good hit at the right time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1140.5s	1140.5	 or you don't have a bad hit at the wrong time. And then the framing over a long enough period of time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1145.9s	1145.9	 I think really becomes the key measure. And the reality is most people don't make it long enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1150.2s	1150.2	 in their career to actually to actually present true results in how they really do underwrite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1155.3s	1155.3	 And by the way, to the extent anybody's listening is able to invest in these private funds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1159.9s	1159.9	 I think Jason mentioned this superficially. So let me just dig into it because I think it's really,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1164.4s	1164.4	 really thoughtful what he said, which you should understand. If you have the option to invest in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1170.9s	1170.9	 private fund, you have to understand that that private fund has two huge negative things working
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1176.6s	1176.6	 against it relative to investing in the S&P 500. So you could put your money into a Vanguard ETF.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1183.4s	1183.4	 Or if you could put your money into a private fund, you need to realize two things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1187.4s	1187.4	 Number one is it is illiquid, not just for 10 years, but it could be illiquid for 12 or 14 or in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1193.0s	1193.0	 you know, Friedberg's case 16 years. So you need to get paid a premium for owning that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1199.8s	1199.8	 And then the second is depending on the business model, you may have very high failure rates,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1204.9s	1204.9	 which means that you need to really hit these outsize Grand Slam home runs. And if you don't,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1211.2s	1211.2	 then you're going to be worse off than if you had invested in the S&P 500. So that deserves a premium.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1216.7s	1216.7	 And so Jason's right, which is the S&P is between seven and 8% over long periods of time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1223.0s	1223.0	 predictable compounding. That's you have to add another seven to 8% for this illiquidity premium,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1230.0s	1230.0	 and another seven to 8% for the business model viability of for example, being in venture,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1235.6s	1235.6	 when you add those three things together, you do need to get paid basically in the low to mid 20s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1242.0s	1242.0	 returns to be justified. Otherwise, you are much better off just owning the S&P 500 much,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1248.8s	1248.8	 much, much better off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1249.8s	1249.8	 Sacks, do you what do you look for when you're L.P.ing? And now that you have many large funds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1256.1s	1256.1	 what do you think LPs are looking for now? What do you advise them to stay focused on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1261.0s	1261.0	 The number one metric that matters is DPI, which is the ratio of distributions to paid in capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1266.4s	1266.4	 It's basically money in versus money out, right? At the end of the day, that's all that matters is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1271.0s	1271.0	 how much money did you put in the fund? How much money did you get out? The issue is that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1274.8s	1274.8	 to Chimass's point, these are 10 to 12 year funds, and it takes a long time to get distributions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1280.2s	1280.2	 All the other metrics are basically triangulations or approximations of what you think the fund's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1285.4s	1285.4	 going to do until you actually get to distributions. I would say in the long term, it's all DPI. In the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1290.5s	1290.5	 short term, you look at TVPI, the total value to paid in capital. So it's basically what's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1295.8s	1295.8	 marked up value of all the positions in the portfolio versus how much cash has gone in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1302.4s	1302.4	 And then the big question is, does the TVPI turn into DPI? Does the total value turn into distributions?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1309.1s	1309.1	 To explain that to people, if Chamath had invested in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1313.7s	1313.7	 Slack, but there hadn't been an outcome, it could be on the books for a billion dollar position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1318.2s	1318.2	 So the TVPI is looking really great, but until that company goes public and the shares are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1324.7s	1324.7	 distributed, the LPs haven't realized it. So it could be ephemeral or it could go down significantly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1331.6s	1331.6	 as we've seen with public markets. Yeah. So in the last four months, we just returned our fund one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1338.5s	1338.5	 in terms of real distributions. I think we have a DPI of 1.1 or 1.2 on that fund now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1343.8s	1343.8	 The TVPI is four to five, but it feels great just to distribute the entire fund out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1350.0s	1350.0	 I literally in my first two funds, I think we did that as well. And it's a really great feeling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1356.2s	1356.2	 Sometimes selling 10% or 20% of a position early and getting over that hurdle and just getting into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1363.6s	1363.6	 the one to two X, that's a pretty great feeling. By the way, just to talk about how difficult it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1368.5s	1368.5	 to convert paper gains into real gains. Let's just say, Jason, in your example, you had a fund that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1374.4s	1374.4	 had these huge paper gains, but haven't distributed anything as coming into this year. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1379.7s	1379.7	 Here's a little interesting data about the ultimate buyer of all of these tech stocks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1384.2s	1384.2	 which is the NASDAQ, right? People that buy stocks in the NASDAQ. Listen to this as of yesterday,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1391.0s	1391.0	 more than 45% of stocks on the NASDAQ are now down 50%. So basically one in two,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1399.4s	1399.4	 more than 22% of stocks on the NASDAQ are down 75%. So almost one in four and more than one in five.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1409.3s	1409.3	 And then more than 5% of stocks. So one in 20 on the NASDAQ are down 90%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1416.2s	1416.2	 So you can use this to actually get a blended average. But what it means is that the ultimate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1422.3s	1422.3	 buyers of tech stocks are taking a 60% discount to what they were able to buy even just four months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1431.0s	1431.0	 ago. 60%. So there is no public mark that will support a private mark unless it's also discounted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1441.4s	1441.4	 by at least 60%. Now think about that when you talk about this entire panoply of companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1449.0s	1449.0	 that have been overfunded, many who are under executing and burning enormous amounts of money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1455.0s	1455.0	 who now have to come back out to the market as any sophisticated buyer will have to tell them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1460.1s	1460.1	 the truth, which is, I'm sorry, guys, but the data says there's a 60% discount to this mark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1464.8s	1464.8	 Are you willing to accept it or not? Otherwise, the lights are going to go off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1467.7s	1467.7	 Yeah. And these marks only happen, at least in the private markets and venture funds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1473.5s	1473.5	 when a transaction occurs. So if somebody raised a bunch of money, as we talked about in previous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1477.2s	1477.2	 episodes, at a billion dollars, you know, and they're now worth 500 million, that's only going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1483.3s	1483.3	 to work itself out in fund documents and reports for a year or two later when the next transaction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1489.6s	1489.6	 occurs. So there's a lagging effect. One thing I just want to bring up before we go into maybe GDP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1498.6s	1498.6	 or the bill whining situation is what we talked about on this problem last year about what was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1505.7s	1505.7	 going to happen in private markets. I've been seeing the last two or three weeks and I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1510.0s	1510.0	 know, Sachs and Freberg, what you're seeing in private markets, but really acutely people who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1516.0s	1516.0	 are going out and skipping rounds this like, I'm going to, you know, just skip my seed round and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1520.2s	1520.2	 just do a series a, I don't have product market fit, I'm going to get credit for work that hasn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1525.3s	1525.3	 been done. I'm going to raise 10 million without product market fit. Oh, my Lord, has this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1530.8s	1530.8	 that has the dialogue changed. I've been on many calls with founders who've met with 50 VCs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1536.7s	1536.7	 And the conversations are moving to, you know, how many months to break even? And, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1543.4s	1543.4	 how many customers do you have? And how have they increased? And let's talk about the churn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1545.9s	1545.9	 It is getting super pragmatic out there. If you're a founder, and we said this a year ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1550.9s	1550.9	 but it's worth stating here, this is not the moment I would try to over optimize. If you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1555.9s	1555.9	 a term sheet or money on the table, I would, I would close it. Just, you know, founder to founder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1561.0s	1561.0	 What are you seeing Sachs? Yeah, I mean, it's gotten a lot harder. I think especially at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1565.4s	1565.4	 growth rounds, we actually have signed to growth term sheets recently, and it was much harder for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1572.6s	1572.6	 us to do growth rounds last year, just because you had these huge mega funds come in at crazy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1577.3s	1577.3	 valuations. But now they're kind of licking their wounds. And we're starting to see some really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1581.4s	1581.4	 attractive growth opportunities. Everyone else is backed off. So it's interesting. Yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1587.1s	1587.1	 it's changed quickly. Yeah. Now one thing to, you know, to raise a good point about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1591.9s	1591.9	 you know, private, not only are private valuations sort of sticky, but private marks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1596.3s	1596.3	 are sticky. And, you know, companies only get remarked every couple of years. And so where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1600.3s	1600.3	 it's a public markets get remarked every day. So it is hard to know like, what is the proper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1605.3s	1605.3	 valuation of a company that raised money last year? Because yes, valuation multiples have come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1612.1s	1612.1	 way down, but then also they may have grown and their performance is better. So the analysis that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1617.0s	1617.0	 I saw Jason Lemkin do in his LP newsletter, and we're basically repeating it for our entire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1622.7s	1622.7	 portfolio is to calculate what was the ARR multiple that you paid, basically valuation divided by ARR,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1630.3s	1630.3	 what was that entry multiple and what is it today. And so we're doing that across our whole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1635.3s	1635.3	 portfolio. So what you see is sorry, sorry, stocks, clarification, ltm error or, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1641.5s	1641.5	 ntm error, which one basically you last 12 months, next 12 months. Yeah, no, you just look at their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1647.1s	1647.1	 current error, which is, you know, run rate, their current revenue. Yeah, exactly. January,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1652.6s	1652.6	 you times it by 12. Or in this case, April. Yeah, basically, yes, you take the current month and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1658.3s	1658.3	 multiply by 12, but they have to be annual commitments, right? So if it's not, it has to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1662.8s	1662.8	 be annually recurring revenue. If they're not in, if it's not an annual commitment with an expectation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1667.4s	1667.4	 that's recurring, you can't count it. So for example, you don't count professional services
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1671.1s	1671.1	 revenue in that, in any event. So the point is, you, you basically calculate what was the multiple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1678.7s	1678.7	 that you paid at, you know, entry in the company and what is it today as a function of the current
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1684.5s	1684.5	 valuation. And what we see is, yeah, there's a lot of companies that we got into, I don't know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1689.6s	1689.6	 two years ago at evaluation multiple that you couldn't defend today, 60 times, 80 times, 100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1695.5s	1695.5	 times. But the multiple today is more like 10 or 20 times, because it's actually grown really fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1701.0s	1701.0	 So you need to look at both sides of the equation. And that's the analysis we're running for every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1705.5s	1705.5	 company in our portfolio. And then, you know, LPs can decide how to how to market. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1711.1s	1711.1	 the most important thing is what's the next investor, if they need more capital,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1714.6s	1714.6	 going to market at? Well, the question is, are you growing faster than valuation multiples are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1718.9s	1718.9	 falling? Correct. And then can you that means you could have a down round, a neutral round,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1724.3s	1724.3	 or possibly an up round, but it doesn't. So are you starting to see people or people discussing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1729.8s	1729.8	 on the board level, or in your firm, hey, maybe we take a sideways round, a neutral round, we just go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1736.0s	1736.0	 to last year's price and top off another 10 million. Are you seeing that? I've told some of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1740.7s	1740.7	 boards I'm on just keep fundraising, just keep the round open top off if there's money available,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1744.8s	1744.8	 because you know, especially if you raised around eight months ago, six months ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1751.0s	1751.0	 those prices, like if people are still willing to invest in those terms, that's a good deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1755.1s	1755.1	 I literally had this conversation with the founder this week where they had raised that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1758.8s	1758.8	 in a great valuation. And they turned money away. Because they were like, yeah, that was a mistake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1765.3s	1765.3	 Growing. So why would we take the money now if our valuation is going to be, you know, double in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1769.8s	1769.8	 nine months? And now it looks like yeah, maybe you know, that extra one to $5 million would have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1775.4s	1775.4	 been good to lock up. Okay. So adding to these headwinds, I think we we've been talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1780.8s	1780.8	 the possibility of a recession for those new to the concept of recession, if you're under the age
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1788.0s	1788.0	 of 30, and haven't really lived through one as an adult, it's two quarters, the official definition,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1793.6s	1793.6	 two quarters of negative growth of the GDP. Well, it turns out, US GDP fell 1.4% in q1.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1801.4s	1801.4	 And q4, we had a 6.9% growth rate. q1 was the weakest since the spring of 2020. When COVID hit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1808.3s	1808.3	 Nick, you the clipboard, Saxon, I basically said this may happen in January of this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1815.1s	1815.1	 So the concern is that, you know, with the losses we're seeing, and I mean, every day, it just keeps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1821.1s	1821.1	 like you've seen more red, that this could turn into a recession, you know, popping of bubbles
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1825.4s	1825.4	 is usually followed by, by recessions are. So I think, you know, the fortunes of the economy could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1831.5s	1831.5	 turn really quickly here. And that is that is the marginal risk. The marginal risk is actually for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1837.3s	1837.3	 recession, David is saying something really important. The risk, in my opinion, is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1842.4s	1842.4	 of runaway inflation anymore. The Fed is now in this really delicate situation where China cut
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1848.6s	1848.6	 rates last week, we have an FOMC meeting, the Open Markets Committee that sets rates on Wednesday,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1853.6s	1853.6	 I think of this coming week. What is he supposed to do? The risk is to a recession, because if we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1858.6s	1858.6	 overcorrect, yes, and the leading indicators all around the world tell us that their economies are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1863.9s	1863.9	 weak, then inflation may have actually been much more transitory than we thought. And right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1869.4s	1869.4	 we have to decide, because if we overcorrect, we're going to plunge the United States economy into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1874.9s	1874.9	 a recession. There's a lot of data here. And obviously, this is when this data is always in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1882.5s	1882.5	 the review mirror. So obviously, we're talking about q1, it takes a while to collect this data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1886.5s	1886.5	 And there's a lot of different factors going on at the same time, obviously, COVID, and obviously,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1891.3s	1891.3	 supply chains, consumer spending rose at a 2.7% annual rate in q1, a slight acceleration from q4,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1897.8s	1897.8	 there was also a 9.2% rise in business spending. So we have a lot of spending going on, who knows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1903.9s	1903.9	 if that is spending that actually occurred in the previous quarters. And because of supply chains,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1908.6s	1908.6	 like people's cars are being delivered, people's machines and manufacturing equipment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1912.9s	1912.9	 is being delivered. Now, we had negative GDP in q1, for a whole host of reasons that can effectively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1918.9s	1918.9	 be summarized by the fact that we are still trying to restart an economy at the tail end of a pandemic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1926.1s	1926.1	 and we're doing it in fits and starts. And so we have these small bursts of incredible GDP,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1930.5s	1930.5	 which we had last year, and then contractions in the economy. The thing that's always been true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1936.6s	1936.6	 about the United States is that we are a consumer driven economic engine, which means that as long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1943.1s	1943.1	 as people feel confident, and they're buying things, the economy tends to do well, and we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1948.3s	1948.3	 tend to move forward as a society. When consumer confidence ebbs, and people contract their spending,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1955.1s	1955.1	 we are in a world of hurt. The last couple of years, we've had a lot of consumer savings,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1961.4s	1961.4	 right? We've had a lot of money that's been pent up in the system, whether it's stimulus checks or,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1967.7s	1967.7	 you know, loan forgiveness or all of this stuff has allowed people to feel much richer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1973.8s	1973.8	 And as a result, they've started to spend in dribs and drabs. The problem now is that because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1978.0s	1978.0	 prices are so high, all of those savings have largely been depleted. I just sent you guys a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1984.3s	1984.3	 text in the group chat of what consumer spending looks like and consumer savings rather. And it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1990.6s	1990.6	 tells a really, really scary story, which is that the savings boom is largely over. Personal savings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=1996.6s	1996.6	 rate fell to 6.2% in March, the lowest since 2013. And so what does that mean? Well, it means that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2002.8s	2002.8	 the setup is there for us to sort of really contract what we are able to spend as a society.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2009.4s	2009.4	 So I think now the odds even push further in this direction, that we could have more quarters of

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2022.2s	2022.2	 scenario, where the government or the Fed specifically races forward to tackle inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2030.0s	2030.0	 And in 2018 and 19, it turned out to be a head fake. And by the way, in 2019, the stock market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2035.9s	2035.9	 ended up more than 30% up 32% or something like that crazy numbers here. And by the way, back then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2042.4s	2042.4	 in 2019, China turned over, it looked like it was going to be a fast moving economic recovery for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2049.5s	2049.5	 China. And instead, they sort of slowed down. We have the same thing here. We have a quarter of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2054.7s	2054.7	 negative GDP. We have China in lockdowns. We have every company that's that's in the manufacturing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2060.0s	2060.0	 supply chain ecosystem telling the world that we don't really know what this is going to look like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2064.4s	2064.4	 Intel today actually said there's going to be shortages in chips through 2024. So I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2071.8s	2071.8	 I think it could be a very difficult path ahead for the Fed. How do you raise rates?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2078.3s	2078.3	 400 basis points into into a slowing economy, you could raise basis points 75, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2085.9s	2085.9	 75 bits, maybe 100 bits, but it gives them very little freedom to operate without really tanking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2092.1s	2092.1	 the economy. There's also another point to highlight here, which is in some of this data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2098.2s	2098.2	 that was released, there was a strong indication that there are real in issues right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2104.1s	2104.1	 with inventories, I don't know if you guys have tried to buy an appliance or a car lately,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2110.9s	2110.9	 or a piece of furniture, but like I tried in the Q4 to buy a car and it was absurd. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2116.0s	2116.0	 right now there's like one year delays to get a friggin couch. I mean, like everything in this in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2120.2s	2120.2	 the global supply chain, somewhat related to the kind of big inflationary pressure that hit us at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2126.6s	2126.6	 the end of last year, and then everyone placed orders, all the factories kind of had to produce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2130.5s	2130.5	 a lot, they all couldn't keep up through to what's going on in China right now, where there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2134.9s	2134.9	 lockdowns and factories are shut down. I have several businesses in the hardware space that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2142.1s	2142.1	 actively searching and frantically trying to find components, suppliers, specific parts, even basic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2148.6s	2148.6	 raw materials like aluminum are very hard to get a hold of. And so there's also a very challenging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2154.1s	2154.1	 inventory and supply chain problem. When that happens, I can't actually wire money and buy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2158.7s	2158.7	 aluminum, because I'm waiting for aluminum to show up. I can't wire and buy the microchips I want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2164.6s	2164.6	 I can't wire money to my car dealership and buy money. So that doesn't get credited on the GDP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2169.6s	2169.6	 counter, because those sales didn't close that quarter. And as we saw with Amazon recently,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2173.4s	2173.4	 and others, and Apple just said that they're expecting I think close to a $10 billion hit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2178.1s	2178.1	 this quarter, because of supply chain issues. A lot of folks want to spend the spending interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2184.0s	2184.0	 is there, the capital flows are there. It's just that the supply chain is clogged up, and we're so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2188.3s	2188.3	 dependent on getting atoms and molecules moved around, and they're all kind of held up in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2193.0s	2193.0	 different places, that folks simply can't get their purchases in. And so the revenue triggers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2198.1s	2198.1	 don't get hit. And so the numbers don't look good from a growth perspective. But it doesn't necessarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2203.4s	2203.4	 mean that the demand isn't there. This is a significant inventory problem and supply chain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2207.9s	2207.9	 problem. That's driving a lot of this adversity right now in the market, it seems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2212.8s	2212.8	 And interestingly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2214.2s	2214.2	 And by the way, that doesn't mean that we're not going to have a recession,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2218.2s	2218.2	 because when I'm not able to spend money on Apple, Apple's spending less on their suppliers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2222.4s	2222.4	 and they're spending less on their suppliers. So there is a trickling effect of capital flows,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2226.4s	2226.4	 and the recessionary effect may be hit. But there is capital and there is demand for consumption.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2232.3s	2232.3	 It's just that we're really clogged up right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2234.6s	2234.6	 Well, and the consumer confidence index has been on a bit of a roller coaster. We were at 130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2240.7s	2240.7	 before the pandemic. For the year of the pandemic, we were down in the high 80s, 87, 88, 89.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2247.0s	2247.0	 We rocketed back up. You know, in 2021, people started to feel like, oh, we've got these vaccines,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2253.7s	2253.7	 things are going to go back to normal rocket back up to 128. And it's been a slow tick down to where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2259.4s	2259.4	 we're now at 107. And so I think consumers don't know what to think. They don't know if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2265.0s	2265.0	 you know, inflation is transitory, they don't know if gas is going to be $7 or $4. They don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2270.6s	2270.6	 know if they should spend a big spend on a big vacation or not. And so this, I think in terms of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2277.5s	2277.5	 people's planning, I don't know if people can plan how their own personal budgets, right. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2283.5s	2283.5	 that's on the confidence thing to Trimont's point, we need to have a predictable economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2290.5s	2290.5	 You know, it can't be this schizophrenic, to use a term. Sax, what do you think about what we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2297.3s	2297.3	 seeing here? In terms of we're obviously either in a recession, or dip, you know, dancing around it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2305.4s	2305.4	 we're basically, you know, on the edge of the cliff right now, I think is probably the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2309.7s	2309.7	 accurate. I tweeted in February, Hey, anyone notice that we've just entered a recession,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2314.0s	2314.0	 and I got dunked on by all the professional economists and you know, all these people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2317.8s	2317.8	 but the experts, the experts, the experts, correct. And now it's like the data just came out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2323.8s	2323.8	 negative 1.5% economic growth in q1. So what I wrote at the time was exactly right. And, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2331.4s	2331.4	 I don't know how the thread the Fed threads this needle. I mean, we've got a slowing economy with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2336.4s	2336.4	 negative GDP growth, you've got inflation is still rampant. It's not as I don't think it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2343.0s	2343.0	 gonna be as high as last year, just because we're lapping a much bigger number from last year. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2346.7s	2346.7	 on a year over your basis, the comps are you started a higher price level, but inflation still there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2353.2s	2353.2	 So, you know, I don't know what you do about that. It's a really tough situation. And when you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2359.7s	2359.7	 this kind of wealth destruction in the stock market, I mean, you know, and we there was a good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2365.0s	2365.0	 tweet that Jamoth you shared, we should put it up on the screen. I mean, so much like wealth has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2370.3s	2370.3	 been destroyed. You don't necessarily see it if you just look at the big cap indices, but you look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2375.4s	2375.4	 at all the engines of prosperity, sort of growth and prosperity, the small caps, the recent IPOs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2381.6s	2381.6	 the growth stocks, they've been absolutely hammered. It really hasn't been this bad since
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2386.1s	2386.1	 the dot com crash of 2000, like, and not just the like, April period, but like all the way in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2392.2s	2392.2	 October where it kept going. And then the 2008 real, yeah, the 2008 real estate crash. So we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2398.5s	2398.5	 already like top three worst situations for growth stocks in the last 20 years. And when you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2406.8s	2406.8	 that kind of like wealth destruction, it eventually trickles down into the economy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2410.1s	2410.1	 because people just feel, you know, companies start cutting budgets, people have less money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2415.3s	2415.3	 people, the spending goes down. That dynamic that that we're referring to in this tweet in that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2420.2s	2420.2	 image is called dispersion, which means, you know, people may be confused when you hear why are all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2425.8s	2425.8	 these stocks down so much, but the indices are not down as much. And it's exactly for the reason that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2431.4s	2431.4	 David just said, which is that underneath the surface, the mega cap tax consumes so much of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2439.7s	2439.7	 the market cap of these indices. So, you know, the Google, the Microsoft, the apples and the Teslas,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2445.4s	2445.4	 those four just clog up an enormous percentage, I think it's approaching 40% of these of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2451.3s	2451.3	 indices. And so underneath the surface, you have dispersion, which means you have these tale of two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2456.5s	2456.5	 kinds of stocks, you have these four big mega caps, and then you have everybody else. And the mega
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2462.8s	2462.8	 caps are generating so much cash, that they're just basically keeping the market afloat. So at this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2468.1s	2468.1	 point, maybe there's a small silver lining. And that silver lining is that to be bearish right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2475.4s	2475.4	 is effectively not being bearish these growth stocks, because as we said, they've been just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2479.6s	2479.6	 decimated. At this point, to be bearish the indices means very specifically to be bearish those four
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2485.6s	2485.6	 names, and only those four names. And so that may actually mean that the market has effectively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2492.6s	2492.6	 crashed already. Yeah, but by the way, I'm not necessarily bearish on growth stocks from here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2497.5s	2497.5	 because like you said, they've already been beat up so badly. The stock market is usually a leading
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2502.1s	2502.1	 indicator. What I'm a bearish about is just the state of the economy, because the stock market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2507.2s	2507.2	 traded down, it trades down on expectations. So it was already trading down months ahead of the slowdown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2513.5s	2513.5	 in the real economy. So now- The market knew in December, the market knew in November,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2517.9s	2517.9	 that the recession was coming. The market peaked in like around November 6th of last year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2521.2s	2521.2	 They knew it was coming in. Yeah. The market knew when we talked about the sales that Bezos and Musk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2525.5s	2525.5	 did, when we sold equities, we were saying, it's like, you can't keep all of your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2532.0s	2532.0	 money on the table all the time, unless you have the durational wherewithal, meaning you're just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2539.2s	2539.2	 not time bounded, and you can just be there forever. And not everybody's in that position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2543.0s	2543.0	 An endowment could be in that position, but individuals with-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2546.2s	2546.2	 No, an endowment is not because they have to create distributions every year, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2549.4s	2549.4	 They have to send- Well, I'm talking about the mega endowments,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2551.1s	2551.1	 where they, you know, Ford or Harvard may not need to do this, but yeah, smaller ones might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2556.0s	2556.0	 actually be operating, you know, Memorial Sloan Kettering might actually be operating their budget
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2560.1s	2560.1	 from it. Yeah, but just to go back to David's point, like, it's a really difficult spot. Like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2563.4s	2563.4	 what is the Fed supposed to do? So they're probably going to tighten 50 basis points in May. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2567.2s	2567.2	 relatively well expected. We'll be able to digest that reasonably well. But what did they say to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2573.0s	2573.0	 David's point? You know, if they all of a sudden go on a crazy program of quantitative tightening,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2578.2s	2578.2	 right? And what is that again? That's when, you know, we were spending, they were spending,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2581.8s	2581.8	 they were printing- Money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2584.3s	2584.3	 Billions and billions of dollars going into the market, buying securities and giving people the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2590.0s	2590.0	 money, right? That's called quantitative easing. Now we're doing the opposite, right? Where they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2595.6s	2595.6	 selling and they want the money back. Now, the problem is what that does is that removes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2599.8s	2599.8	 liquidity from the market. And when you remove liquidity from a market, you actually make it a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2605.8s	2605.8	 little bit more fragile, a little bit more precarious, a little bit more price sensitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2610.6s	2610.6	 And so it puts us in a very tough situation when the economy is slowing, when these guys may be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2617.9s	2617.9	 raising rates, and then at the same time, removing money from the system, it may be a lot for all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2623.8s	2623.8	 us to handle. And so I think that they're under a really difficult- Well, and if you-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2628.9s	2628.9	 Set of decisions. There is a business cycle and you know, there are always recessions periodically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2633.9s	2633.9	 every seven to 10 years, but they have really magnified this because you had the Fed for years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2640.0s	2640.0	 maintain interest rates really too low and doing quantitative easing during a boom. And then the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2645.6s	2645.6	 federal government was printing trillions and trillions of dollars and they didn't stop. It was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2650.2s	2650.2	 one thing to do it during that sort of COVID recession, but then last year they printed that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2655.9s	2655.9	 last two trillion and that's what set off this wave of inflation. So, you know, when I was like in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2660.0s	2660.0	 school learning about economics and they would tell us that all these government programs and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2663.3s	2663.3	 actions are like automatic stabilizers or what have you, like the government helps balance out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2668.2s	2668.2	 the business cycle. No, the government like magnifies the business cycle. They've made this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2672.3s	2672.3	 so much worse. Well, they're putting their hand on the steering wheel, right? It's like, let the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2676.2s	2676.2	 economy drive, let the free market do this. And if you start, you know, you might overseer into-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2680.7s	2680.7	 The federal government is great at setting incentives, right? And creating like tax credit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2684.6s	2684.6	 programs and incentives for private enterprise to invest money. But when they act as a direct
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2688.7s	2688.7	 market participant and start to actually direct capital flows and make decisions about how the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2692.6s	2692.6	 capital market should work, it never ends well because this is not what they're good at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2696.6s	2696.6	 Well, I think there's also another, I mean, just to counter that there's also this other issue of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2701.4s	2701.4	 not just incentives, but when they create a free capital that then allows a market to find a way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2708.9s	2708.9	 to take advantage of that free capital. And that's effectively what we've seen happen with Medicare,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2714.2s	2714.2	 Medicaid, as well as with the student loan program. And, you know, I don't know if we're going to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2719.6s	2719.6	 to the student loan program today, but I think, you know, to your point, Chamath, one of the things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2724.3s	2724.3	 that's happened with the cost of education in this country is that the federal program, which was,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2730.6s	2730.6	 you know, and I took a bunch of notes here to talk about this today,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2733.9s	2733.9	 but the federal government began guaranteeing student loans in 1965. It's called the Federal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2738.6s	2738.6	 Family Education Loan Program. And that program made capital available for students to borrow,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2745.5s	2745.5	 to spend on universities or whatever education they want to go get of their own choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2753.3s	2753.3	 And the idea being that that will give them the ability to go make more income and extend their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2757.3s	2757.3	 careers and educate the workforce. And the problem is that when that capital was made available,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2762.6s	2762.6	 a lot of private universities started to emerge and private for-profit colleges started to emerge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2767.8s	2767.8	 And in the years since that that program was introduced, I just want to give you guys some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2771.2s	2771.2	 crazy statistics. So in the 1969-70 era, the cost for a public four-year college was 1200 bucks a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2779.0s	2779.0	 year. That's room, board, tuition and fees. And in 2020, that cost rose to $21,000. And here's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2788.0s	2788.0	 the other crazy stat for private four-year college in 1970, 2500 a year, 2019, 2020,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2795.4s	2795.4	 $46,000 a year. And so that capital basically allowed these for-profit organizations or these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2803.0s	2803.0	 organizations that are trying to grow their endowments, which are effectively like for-profits,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2807.0s	2807.0	 to charge any price they wanted. And the consumer, the student would be able to get free capital to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2812.9s	2812.9	 fund that quote unquote education, because it was available to them for free from the federal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2818.5s	2818.5	 government. And so the federal government created a bubble in education costs. And that bubble in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2824.1s	2824.1	 education cost has now overburdened 15% of American adults with student loans, that many of which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2831.2s	2831.2	 they would never be able to pay back. And now we're in this really awkward situation of saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2835.4s	2835.4	 hey, maybe we should forgive those loans, because it's unfair that people are burdened by this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2839.4s	2839.4	 And doing so obviously doesn't solve the fundamental problem, which is that making those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2844.9s	2844.9	 loans available in the first place creates an inflationary bubble effect in the end asset. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2850.2s	2850.2	 the end asset in this case is education. But we've seen the same thing with housing. And we've seen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2854.9s	2854.9	 the same thing with pharmaceutical drugs and medical care and other services. So any place where the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2859.6s	2859.6	 federal government steps in and says, I will provide a backstop, I will provide free capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2864.6s	2864.6	 to support and create a quote unquote incentive for this market to accelerate, you end up with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2869.4s	2869.4	 these inflationary bubble. You're going to have people game the system, right? You get whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2873.2s	2873.2	 University of Phoenix types and you even the large universities raising tuition to observe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2880.6s	2880.6	 things and people take these loans Chamath, before their frontal lobes are even fully developed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2885.5s	2885.5	 and they have long term understanding of the ramifications of this. So where do you stand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2890.9s	2890.9	 on this Chamath? Yeah. So there's a there's an interesting article in the Atlantic about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2895.2s	2895.2	 who really wins when you forgive student loan debt. And I and I just pulled out some facts. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2900.8s	2900.8	 I'm just going to look down here and read them just so I get them right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2904.6s	2904.6	 It said in the article, 13% of the US population carries federal student loan debt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2911.4s	2911.4	 Grad students account for 37% of that federal student loan dollars. Currently, it's 1.6 trillion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2917.8s	2917.8	 of total student debt versus about 10 trillion of mortgage debt. So the average debt has gone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2924.6s	2924.6	 from about 25k in 2012 to 37k in 2022. So, you know, almost a 50% increase in a decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2932.6s	2932.6	 The majority of student debt is held by white borrowers. Only 23% of black Americans age 24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2940.1s	2940.1	 or greater have a college degree in 2019. So the majority of the black population would not be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2945.9s	2945.9	 directly benefited by student loan forgiveness. In 2020, the median weekly earnings for someone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2953.6s	2953.6	 without a high school diploma was $619. For those with some college but no degree,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2961.7s	2961.7	 that number was $877. For those with a bachelor's degree, it was $1,305. And that number continues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2969.8s	2969.8	 to grow for masters and professional degrees and, and PhDs. Interestingly, the last two points,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2976.6s	2976.6	 the Gallup organization who ran a poll is unable, quote, to report the percentage of Americans who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2984.0s	2984.0	 have mentioned student debt or student debt cancellation, because it hasn't garnered enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2989.4s	2989.4	 mentions to do so. In 2022, according to the article across four Gallup polls, quote, just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=2995.2s	2995.2	 one respondent mentioned student debt as the most important problem facing the nation unquote. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3001.5s	3001.5	 then last thing is here is that 43% of the 2020 Biden electorate graduated from a four-year college
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3009.8s	3009.8	 or university versus 36% of Democrats in 2012. So, you know, one of the takeaways is that this may
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3018.4s	3018.4	 be an issue that affects a certain percentage of the Dems who went to college, but it may not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3025.5s	3025.5	 represent a plurality of all Democrats. And it doesn't represent, you know, a majority of all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3030.6s	3030.6	 our vocal though, to your point, I think. Yeah. I mean, look, this is, I think that there are two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3035.2s	3035.2	 motivations, political motivations for doing this now. They're pretty obvious. And then I just want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3041.9s	3041.9	 to say three things on kind of the concern about this and why I feel very strongly that if we don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3049.4s	3049.4	 fix the underlying system, you cannot forgive student loans. You have to fix the system before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3055.4s	3055.4	 forgiving student loans. Fix it first. What's the number one fix for you? Well, so let me just say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3059.0s	3059.0	 the two motivations. The two motivations, number one, this is a stimulus. So this morning, the Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3062.9s	3062.9	 administration said that they were thinking about taking executive action to make the first $10,000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3068.5s	3068.5	 of student loans forgiven. So if you do the math across 43 million people, that's a roughly half
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3073.9s	3073.9	 trillion dollar forgiveness. What happens? That half trillion dollars, much like we saw last year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3079.8s	3079.8	 becomes a stimulus payment. It is money that people now have that they didn't have before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3084.2s	3084.2	 It is capital that they or freedom from debt that they didn't have before. And it will stimulate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3088.7s	3088.7	 the economy. So there is a very important economic incentive here to do this, which is if we do it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3094.7s	3094.7	 it will be stimulating to the economy and people will spend more and the economy will grow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3100.3s	3100.3	 By the way, that's a two and a half percent boost to GDP.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3103.4s	3103.4	 Right. So half a trillion dollars of free money just flushes into the system. The second thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3108.0s	3108.0	 is that it will help in the midterms is their point of view. Right. So they've obviously done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3111.0s	3111.0	 the most. They've done the polling here. Right. And it's like, hey, when I was in junior high,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3115.4s	3115.4	 the kid that ran for class president was like, I'm going to make everything in a vending machine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3118.3s	3118.3	 free. Guess what? That kid got voted in. So, you know, the idea that you're just going to give
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3122.4s	3122.4	 everyone free, give your loans back to you for free. Everyone's like, my gosh, this is the best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3126.7s	3126.7	 thing ever. Elizabeth Warren, you're a genius. You know, Bernie Sanders, you're a genius. Joe Biden,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3130.6s	3130.6	 you're a genius. Let's say yes. And so they believe through polling that this is going to help them in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3135.9s	3135.9	 the midterms. But the challenge is if we don't solve the problem, if there's no standard of value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3142.8s	3142.8	 of an education, if there's no standard around whether or not a specific accredited university
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3148.6s	3148.6	 increases your income and earning potential as an individual or increases the opportunity for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3153.8s	3153.8	 as an individual, you are wasting money. You are giving federal dollars to private companies who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3160.2s	3160.2	 are profiteering from that. And the individuals are not going to benefit from it. And I think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3164.8s	3164.8	 we're seeing this sorry, and we're seeing the structure really continue in a lot of other places
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3169.4s	3169.4	 where the federal government doesn't hold itself accountable to the standards of how their stimulus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3174.2s	3174.2	 is meant to benefit the individuals that it is being funded for. The individuals are not getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3178.4s	3178.4	 a good education in many cases. They're not earning more by getting this education. Chamath's data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3183.6s	3183.6	 speaks to the average, but a large percentage of people go to crappy universities that don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3188.4s	3188.4	 improve their earnings potential. And then the federal government says, here's this free money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3193.0s	3193.0	 that private university just made a bunch of money and no one's better off. And guess who's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3196.7s	3196.7	 end up paying for it? Taxpayers are going to end up paying that private company a bunch of money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3200.8s	3200.8	 because we're going to forgive all the loans. And so we have to have a standard around whether or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3205.0s	3205.0	 not a dollar should be loaned to pay for education at a specific university by having that university
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3210.6s	3210.6	 prove that it improves the potential. And by the way, if you stop the federal student loan program
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3215.4s	3215.4	 today, fewer people would go to college. And if fewer people went to college, guess what would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3219.8s	3219.8	 happen? Colleges would drop their tuition. Supply and demand. And the reason they're able to raise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3225.9s	3225.9	 their tuition is because there's so much demand because there's free money. And so if we actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3229.5s	3229.5	 saw the federal loan program cut back or put these standards in place, the cost of tuition would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3233.8s	3233.8	 actually decline. And profiteering would decline, people will get a better education and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3238.6s	3238.6	 taxpayers would be better off end of diatribe. Sorry. No, no, it's I think it's completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3242.4s	3242.4	 legitimate. Sachs, we talked on a previous episode about how people make things like immigration,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3248.3s	3248.3	 you know, such a charge philosophical debate, when there are point based systems being used
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3252.5s	3252.5	 in Canada, Australia and other places that make it much more logical. Do you think the solution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3257.7s	3257.7	 here is to freeberg's point of just and I'm interpreting freeberg's point as what is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3263.0s	3263.0	 value of this degree nursing? Great nurses can take out 100% of their loans because we know there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3268.2s	3268.2	 nursing shortage. You know, philosophy graduate students maybe can't take out more than $5,000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3275.3s	3275.3	 in debt because we don't see a bunch of job openings for that. Getting a history degree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3279.7s	3279.7	 Trump University is a lot different than getting a nursing degree. So Sachs, what's the solution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3284.0s	3284.0	 here? And then we'll give you your your swing at bat in terms of buying votes. Yeah, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3292.7s	3292.7	 solution first before we go partisan. Look, I think that alone only makes sense when it generates ROI,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3300.0s	3300.0	 right? It makes you're going to generate more income on the other side of that loan to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3303.8s	3303.8	 that loan worthwhile. And the problem here in too many cases is these kids go to these schools,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3308.8s	3308.8	 they spend five years there, they get a degree in some woke nonsense. And of course, it doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3314.2s	3314.2	 help their earnings power. I mean, that's a bit that's the fundamental issue here is that these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3318.3s	3318.3	 degrees are worthless, right? I mean, if you go if you go to if you go to college to get, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3324.0s	3324.0	 to become a doctor or maybe a computer program or something where the skills have value, then of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3329.4s	3329.4	 course, you can pay back the loan because you get a gainful job. But, you know, otherwise, if you just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3335.0s	3335.0	 major in fine arts at Harvard or something like that, I mean, you basically graduate, you get a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3340.0s	3340.0	 job at what the New York Times is your dream, you can't pay back your loans, you're saddled with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3344.1s	3344.1	 this enormous debt. And think about the cultural impact that has you have this young generation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3349.0s	3349.0	 who believes in socialism. And I think this is a big part of the reason why is they have no capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3353.1s	3353.1	 and they have no ability to accumulate capital, because they're so saddled with debt. So to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3358.4s	3358.4	 interpret where you said, sex, hard to believe in capitalism, if you got no capital, right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3362.6s	3362.6	 if you start if you start the race at negative $250,000 in debt to get a degree that was basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3368.3s	3368.3	 worthless for you. Yeah, so system is correct. I think maybe what we do is we reform the debt,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3374.3s	3374.3	 I had actually okay with forgiving the debt in some instances, if you got a reform of the system,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3380.4s	3380.4	 in other words, right, if we stop funding these worthless degrees, but if you're basically going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3385.0s	3385.0	 to acknowledge that, hey, we need debt forgiveness, because these degrees are worthless, why would you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3388.8s	3388.8	 keep funding those degrees? So, you know, we need to have like a more honest comprehensive solution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3393.8s	3393.8	 here. The other thing we should do actually is one really crazy part of bankruptcy law is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3400.7s	3400.7	 student debt is one of the only types of debt that's not dischargeable in bankruptcy. I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3405.8s	3405.8	 know if you guys know that, but right under George W. Bush's presidency, explain it to everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3410.0s	3410.0	 Yeah, basically, look, when if you ever get to the point where you have too much debt, and you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3414.6s	3414.6	 never pay it back, you declare bankruptcy, and then the court starts you over from zero. So you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3419.1s	3419.1	 can at least start building some wealth, right? But you lose credit. But you lose credit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3423.2s	3423.2	 Exactly. No one's going to want to give you credit after that, but at least you're not so deep in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3427.3s	3427.3	 hole, you can never recover. So that's the point of a personal bankruptcy. But the crazy thing is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3432.6s	3432.6	 that in bankruptcy, you cannot get your college debt, your student debt canceled. You can get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3439.0s	3439.0	 your credit card debt canceled, you can get other types of debt canceled, you can't get your student
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3443.0s	3443.0	 loans canceled. It's crazy. So that's one thing they should fix immediately, is make these debts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3448.7s	3448.7	 dischargeable. If it was private market, Sachs, you wouldn't need to do that, right? The reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3452.3s	3452.3	 that's the case is because it's federal dollars that are funding those loans. But if it was private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3456.3s	3456.3	 market dollars, people actually, if banks and lenders took a loss, when people couldn't pay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3462.3s	3462.3	 back the loans, then the market would work itself out. The problem is it's the federal government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3466.4s	3466.4	 stepping in and trying to be a market maker. Right. And it creates this totally crazy incentive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3470.9s	3470.9	 Right. It creates double distortions. On the one hand, like you said, it basically means that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3475.6s	3475.6	 because government money is funding everything, the tuition goes up because college is taking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3479.0s	3479.0	 advantage of it. But then also nobody's really making a smart ROI decision about whether,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3484.1s	3484.1	 a smart underwriting decision about whether this loan is worth making, whether it actually stands
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3489.9s	3489.9	 a reasonable shot of being paid back. There is such an easy free market solution here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3494.0s	3494.0	 It's called an ISA. It stands for income sharing agreement. This is where you give a loan to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3500.2s	3500.2	 somebody and you get a percentage of their income over a period of time capped at a certain multiple,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3507.4s	3507.4	 say 2X. And what this does is it aligns the person giving the loan with the job that's expected to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3514.1s	3514.1	 come from the education. You already have that. You already have that. It's called taxes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3518.7s	3518.7	 Yeah. But here's the problem. Nobody's watching the store. So nobody's looking at it saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3522.3s	3522.3	 I will give an ISA at this percentage return for nursing. Nursing happens to have ISAs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3526.6s	3526.6	 I gotta pay 50% of my income every year to the federal government. Like I pay taxes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3530.9s	3530.9	 The thing we have to remember is like if the federal government tries to do this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3534.0s	3534.0	 it really is just about buying votes going into a midterm election. And here's why.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3538.6s	3538.6	 If you arbitrarily give a bailout of one sliver of the population,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3544.9s	3544.9	 unless that sliver is really, really large, which we know it is not,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3548.7s	3548.7	 it's going to really anger everybody else. Think of all the people that are tradespeople,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3553.8s	3553.8	 working class people who don't have a college degree. What are they going to think? What about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3558.2s	3558.2	 all the people that just finished paying off their debt? What are they going to think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3562.6s	3562.6	 It's going to upset so many people. And ultimately what this is, is a bunch of coastal elites who are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3568.8s	3568.8	 miscast in jobs and saddled with debt is pushing for a program that isn't a broad based mechanism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3576.7s	3576.7	 to create equality at all. It's just a get out of jail free card for a small people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3581.8s	3581.8	 for a small group of people who unfortunately were taken advantage of. And this is the thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3585.4s	3585.4	 that we're not losing sight. We're losing sight of. You can only pay back a loan if you're making
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3591.9s	3591.9	 more money than you owe. And the fact that this exists shows that these loans were really poorly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3599.1s	3599.1	 constructed and they were given in instances where they should not have been in the private markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3604.4s	3604.4	 We've seen that happen, but we go through a cleansing mechanism to sort it out. Right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3609.5s	3609.5	 That's literally what happened during the 2008 real estate bubble. People gave mortgages to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3613.6s	3613.6	 people who could not pay them back. If I, as a lender, think that you're not going to be able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3618.2s	3618.2	 to pay back the loan, I don't give you the loan. That's the simple mechanism that exists in free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3624.2s	3624.2	 markets. And part of the issue is a lot of people got loans thinking without doing the calculation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3630.3s	3630.3	 will I ever be able to pay this back? And they took the loan to get an education. The other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3634.9s	3634.9	 concept that I will just make money. But let me ask one other question of you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3638.6s	3638.6	 At what age and at what level do you think individuals should take responsibility for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3645.0s	3645.0	 the decisions that they're making when they take on personal debt? Because we see ourselves getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3649.8s	3649.8	 in the cycle where consumers are given debt. They don't think about the consequences of that debt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3655.6s	3655.6	 down the road or do the analysis themselves. And maybe they're not equipped to, and they'll take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3659.5s	3659.5	 out a loan on a car, on a house, on a, but the problem is, and on a lot on, on education, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3666.9s	3666.9	 here's the thing, like the education is a very dangerous thing because we put so much societal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3672.2s	3672.2	 credit and external signaling to it. And we give everyone effectively the same quantum of risk,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3678.1s	3678.1	 but that's not true for a credit card, nor is it true for a car loan. So the private markets are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3683.2s	3683.2	 efficient in that when you first try to get a credit card, sure, you don't get an MX and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3687.1s	3687.1	 turion or platinum card. You're given a chase Sapphire card with a $500 limit. And you earn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3692.9s	3692.9	 the right to borrow more. Same. If you applied for a car loan, the same with a mortgage,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3697.4s	3697.4	 it's based on a down payment. So there's differential risk pricing. And if you don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3701.7s	3701.7	 have differential risk pricing, you're getting a lot of people. How would you edit education?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3705.9s	3705.9	 The market would figure it out. The market would, because you would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3708.4s	3708.4	 differentially price the risk as, as you guys literally brainstorm it right now. Like what are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3712.1s	3712.1	 your grades? Well, no, what courses did you take? Whatever it is, we're not going to get it right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3717.4s	3717.4	 The market will get it right, but the market would figure it out. The problem is, and sorry,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3722.0s	3722.0	 the incentive was, and this is a really important point. You know, if you guys read Ray Dalio's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3726.7s	3726.7	 book, which we've talked about a number of times, he's identified and highlighted that a growing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3731.3s	3731.3	 economy and a successful country improves by improving education and having more people get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3740.5s	3740.5	 higher education, generally speaking. And so the initial incentive, the initial intention behind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3746.3s	3746.3	 the federal student loan program was a good one, which was to give people access to capital that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3751.2s	3751.2	 the private markets were not providing at the time so that they could go out and get a higher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3755.0s	3755.0	 education. We could improve the education of our workforce and we could grow our economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3760.3s	3760.3	 Nowadays, the question that we always forget, remember, we always get one step away and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3764.6s	3764.6	 two steps away and five steps away. And we missed the point. We're in that moment now where the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3769.3s	3769.3	 question really is, is the federal student loan program doing more harm than good? Are we actually,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3775.3s	3775.3	 are we actually creating value from our higher education system in this country or not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3779.7s	3779.7	 No, most importantly is the private market there because you look at the total debt outstanding,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3783.7s	3783.7	 $1.7 trillion. There would be a private market. Yeah.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3792.1s	3792.1	 Okay. The data tells you in every single, which way possible that we are not educating our young
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3798.3s	3798.3	 people to take the jobs that are needed for a high growth, functionally moving economy. We know that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3805.4s	3805.4	 So we are miseducating these folks and then we are giving them access to enormous amounts of debt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3811.5s	3811.5	 that they have no reasonable chance to pay back. And I think that that should be fixed by fixing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3816.2s	3816.2	 the incentives of the universities. You are right. Universities today are for-profit asset

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3826.6s	3826.6	 to get you to go there and pay $50,000 a year in tuition. It's a joke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3830.6s	3830.6	 And they're calling people to think that these degrees are actually going to make them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3835.0s	3835.0	 successful humans. They come out miseducated and under-educated and incapable of servicing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3846.1s	3846.1	 off the table for a second and just say any consumer handout that touches less than, you know,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3862.4s	3862.4	 in this case, 15% of the US population. It's a lot of people, but it also means that there's 85%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3867.6s	3867.6	 who don't benefit. What will those 85% of the people say when they have to foot the bill for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3872.1s	3872.1	 the first 15%? And then what do you think happens with other kinds of debt? What happens when the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3879.0s	3879.0	 oil lobby says, forgive our debt because we're in a national energy crisis? What will all the climate

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3889.1s	3889.1	 And my last point on this is to the extent that we actually want to forgive student debt,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3895.9s	3895.9	 I'm fine if that's the law of the land. That's great. It should go to the floor and it should

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3910.7s	3910.7	 Well, by the way, just on the politics of that, I think this could potentially hurt them because,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3926.7s	3926.7	 They majored in things that didn't increase their earnings potential.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3930.3s	3930.3	 Meanwhile, the majority of the country is working class. Something like two-thirds of the country

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3938.6s	3938.6	 this bailout in one way or another, either through higher taxes or more deficit spending or more debt.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3949.9s	3949.9	 to bail out the professional class?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3951.0s	3951.0	 Like somebody working in retail is paying for somebody's graduate school degree in

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3958.3s	3958.3	 To the answer to Freeberg's question, we actually know when executive function

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3968.4s	3968.4	 thinking. So there is an argument that people should not be allowed to take these loans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3974.5s	3974.5	 That are not even that you can't get out of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3978.9s	3978.9	 Or there should be some cap on the amount of loans you can take because people at the age of 17,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3990.2s	3990.2	 University of Waterloo and fantastic engineering school.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3993.7s	3993.7	 The reason I went there and I did electrical engineering there is that they had a program
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=3997.8s	3997.8	 where after the first year, so the first year looks like every other year at every other school.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4002.2s	4002.2	 But you're there for two semesters from September to May. But after that, you start working and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4008.9s	4008.9	 alternate four months of work with four months of school. And you get paid for that work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4014.4s	4014.4	 And what it allowed me to do was graduate with meaningfully less debt. But it also allowed me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4020.2s	4020.2	 to graduate with a commercial skill set. And I was able to get a job. And in that moment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4025.8s	4025.8	 actually, I was working at a bank and I got profoundly lucky, which is I worked for an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4030.2s	4030.2	 individual. And I was trading interest rate derivatives. And I was learning to trade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4036.5s	4036.5	 technology stocks on the side. And this guy, Mike Fisher, incredible human being. And I made in one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4043.4s	4043.4	 year like 25 or $30,000 for him. He wrote me a check. And he said, here, you have $25,000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4050.2s	4050.2	 of student debt, go pay it off right now. I'll let you cash out this whole book. I graduated with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4054.2s	4054.2	 about 28,000 of debt. I had about 8,000, I think I had somewhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4059.9s	4059.9	 between 10 and 15,000 10 and 20,000. And then I got my first bonus check after my first year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4065.6s	4065.6	 of work after undergrad. And I paid off all my debt and it felt incredible credible. It was amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4071.8s	4071.8	 When I paid off my debt. I've never been in debt since I walked downstairs to the bank and I paid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4077.5s	4077.5	 I gave them the check and I endorsed it. And I said, here's my student loan number. And I was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4082.0s	4082.0	 like, Oh my god, I was free for the it's like it was an enormous sense of relief. For me, it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4087.4s	4087.4	 credit card debt. I had accumulated all the credit card because I went to Cal. It was like four
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4090.2s	4090.2	 grand a year to go to college. It was a lot cheaper back then.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4093.0s	4093.0	 If I didn't go to Waterloo, I would have had double the debt because I wouldn't have had work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4097.0s	4097.0	 But then also, like I think about all these scenarios, I wouldn't have had two years of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4100.5s	4100.5	 work experience. I may not have gotten the job that I did at Bank of Montreal at the time that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4104.9s	4104.9	 may not have been able to give me a chance to meet Mike Fisher. Hey, all these things could have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4109.4s	4109.4	 happened. So you can't rely on the luck of the butterfly effect so that you have a reasonable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4114.5s	4114.5	 shot of building a good life. Yeah, right. So there are all these things in universities that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4118.9s	4118.9	 I think are really mismanaged today. And they go and work against what is right in society.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4124.6s	4124.6	 So I'll give you another example. The the Dean of the Engineering School and the President of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4128.9s	4128.9	 University of Waterloo was here this week with me. And I asked them, tell me about these global
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4133.8s	4133.8	 rankings. And they said, you know, it's just a really difficult game. They said, if we wanted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4139.0s	4139.0	 to compete to try to get high on the list, we would have to do the things that would undo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4145.9s	4145.9	 all the things that made us great and unique in the first place. And I was like, you know what,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4150.5s	4150.5	 I am such a huge supporter of this school, please just continue to do what you're doing. And I'm so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4155.0s	4155.0	 proud that they have the strength to just stand on their own two feet. But every other school
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4159.4s	4159.4	 is running this shell game of, you know, gerrymandering all of these statistics,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4164.8s	4164.8	 trying to get high on the list to trick some parent to force their kid to go to some school
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4170.2s	4170.2	 to then graduate with $200,000 of debt to get a job that doesn't then give them any line of sight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4176.1s	4176.1	 to paying it off. It is I don't think it's their kids' fault. But you have to reform the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4183.0s	4183.0	 And I think the first thing you need to do is look inside these universities and hold these folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4186.7s	4186.7	 accountable. I mean, this incentive systems are just crazy. Speaking about crazy, we talked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4194.7s	4194.7	 about Bill Wang and his. That's your transition. Sorry, they can't all be as elegant and smooth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4203.4s	4203.4	 Here's J. Calhoun. He's looking at the agenda for today. And he sees Bill Huang. And he's like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4207.5s	4207.5	 okay, how do I do this? How do I do this? The wanger, the wanger. Yeah. Crazy. The linkage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4213.0s	4213.0	 is craziness. Okay, go. I mean, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, hold on. The linkage is trillions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4217.9s	4217.9	 and billions. Yeah. Link. Speaking of trillions and billions. Trillion dollar mistakes. We got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4224.3s	4224.3	 Wang and his CFO were arrested on Wednesday and charged with racketeering, wire fraud and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4229.2s	4229.2	 conspiracy. We talked about this when it happened. His firm, Archway Ghosts. I think it's Archay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4236.8s	4236.8	 Ghosts. Archay Ghosts. Archay Ghosts. His poorly named firm and family office. We covered this in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4242.3s	4242.3	 real time back on episode 28. They famously lost $20 billion over two days when they were margin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4249.0s	4249.0	 called back in March of 2021. He worked at Tiger Management, yada yada. And it was at the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4258.0s	4258.0	 reported that they were trading billions of dollars at over 5x leverage. According to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4263.0s	4263.0	 SEC complaint, at its peak, the firm was managing $36 billion with $160 billion of exposure, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4269.4s	4269.4	 is 4.5 times leverage. But Archay Ghosts, or however it's pronounced, started with only $1.5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4275.4s	4275.4	 billion in assets in March of 2020. So Wang flipped $1.5 billion in capital into $160 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4283.2s	4283.2	 of exposure in 12 months, essentially trading somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 to one at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4287.8s	4287.8	 its peak. According to this complaint, a bunch of banks have lost money because they were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4294.2s	4294.2	 supporting this credit. Swiss lost $5.5 billion. Morgan Stanley lost $1 billion UBS $774 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4301.2s	4301.2	 The New York Times described it as quote, orchestrating a stock manipulation scheme
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4305.5s	4305.5	 that relied on them masking and concealing the enormous risk they had taken. Chamath,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4311.2s	4311.2	 you had some thoughts on this, I think. So first, I think we should probably explain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4316.3s	4316.3	 how he did this, right? So that's everybody's question is how did the banks let this happen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4322.2s	4322.2	 I think first, it's what's the mechanism. So, you know, there are ways in capital markets to take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4328.0s	4328.0	 really extreme bets. This way is called what's called a total return swap. And so the basic way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4336.7s	4336.7	 that this works is you have two people on each side of a trade. And what you basically say is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4344.2s	4344.2	 let's agree on what's called a reference asset. So I'll just use an example. Let's just say it's,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4352.1s	4352.1	 I think Discovery was one of the companies that they were trading. So Discovery Communications,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4355.8s	4355.8	 let's look at let's that's the reference asset that stock. And what I'm going to do is buy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4362.4s	4362.4	 protection. And what you're going to do is self protection. And essentially, what happens is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4371.4s	4371.4	 as the stock goes up and down, you're going to net the difference between these two people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4378.1s	4378.1	 And when you do it that way via a derivative, so what it what it forces the person to do the bank,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4384.3s	4384.3	 in this case, is to go out and buy the stock, okay, so that they are hedged in case the price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4391.7s	4391.7	 goes up a lot, because they have to pay that difference, in this case to Bill Huang. And if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4397.1s	4397.1	 the price goes down, Bill Huang has to pay that difference back to the bank. So what happened is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4404.9s	4404.9	 that he went to three different banks, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4411.0s	4411.0	 And effectively, what he did was he bought, he made these bets across a handful of names.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4418.6s	4418.6	 But he did it with so much leverage that he ended up owning 60 or 70% of some of these companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4425.0s	4425.0	 And in March of last year, when the stock market turned over, he owed them enormous amounts of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4430.6s	4430.6	 money. So much so that these banks had to unwind these trades, which caused further down drafts in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4436.6s	4436.6	 the stock and almost spilled over to the broader stock market. Jason, that the numbers from the SEC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4442.2s	4442.2	 complaint are pretty crazy. As of March 31 of 2020, they had 1.6 billion invested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4450.0s	4450.0	 on a gross exposure of 10.2 billion, which that what that means is, they were able to go and lever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4456.2s	4456.2	 up this 1.6 billion to behave in the market as if they had 10.2 billion. By January 1 of 2021,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4464.6s	4464.6	 so nine months later, they had $7.7 billion of invested capital. So they'd done really well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4471.8s	4471.8	 they'd made 70% on this 10 billion. But they levered that up again. And so they had gross
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4476.9s	4476.9	 exposure of $54 billion. And then just, I think three months later, by March 22,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4485.9s	4485.9	 they had $36 billion of invested capital, meaning they had $36 billion of cash. This guy had taken
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4491.6s	4491.6	 1.6 and spun it up to 36 billion and basically, this guy went like 20 in a year. But then he had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4501.0s	4501.0	 levered that up again, and he had $160 billion of gross exposure. And then the market turned and he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4507.0s	4507.0	 owed all this money. And so all these folks had to get out of it. But they also alleged that he was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4511.0s	4511.0	 trying to do short squeezes on the stocks to try to make them goose even more. So there was massive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4515.7s	4515.7	 manipulation because of his position size, correct? Yes. So this is what happened. But then here's how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4520.2s	4520.2	 it is allowed to happen. So if you try to do the same thing in interest rates in the interest rates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4526.1s	4526.1	 market versus the equities market, it's not possible. Why? If I wanted to go and buy a credit default
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4532.0s	4532.0	 swap, effectively think of that as the same kind of thing he did, but on the debt of a company on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4536.4s	4536.4	 the debt of discovery. What I would do is I would be able to enter into that trade with a bank,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4542.4s	4542.4	 but it goes into a clearinghouse. And that clearinghouse is able to tell all the banks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4548.4s	4548.4	 how much risk is building up in the system. And the reason we implemented this clearinghouse was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4554.0s	4554.0	 to make sure coming out of the great financial crisis, none of that chaos ever happened again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4559.0s	4559.0	 But we did not include the equity markets in that clearinghouse and in the laws that regulate it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4564.8s	4564.8	 And so what this is, is a very shadowy, great part of the of the market that is poorly regulated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4570.4s	4570.4	 that has very little oversight. So what do the banks do? The banks say to you,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4765.4s	4765.4	 board will be led by disinformation expert Nina Jankiewicz. Jankiewicz. He has researched Russian

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4782.7s	4782.7	 have such a strong opinion. You have such a nose for what's BS and what's not. Here's what's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4787.8s	4787.8	 on here. So first of all, this woman claims to be an expert in disinformation. Let's evaluate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4792.6s	4792.6	 that claim. She was an active pusher of the Steele dossier, which turns out is disinformation for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4799.1s	4799.1	 what people are now under indictment. She also was active in trying to censor the Hunter Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4804.4s	4804.4	 laptop story, which as it now turns out was not disinformation. It was absolutely true as acknowledged
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4809.4s	4809.4	 by the New York Times, the Washington Post. You would think that these blemishes on her record
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4814.5s	4814.5	 might disqualify her from being an expert on disinformation, but actually in the view that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4819.1s	4819.1	 people are hiring her, these are actually qualifications because they are not interested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4824.0s	4824.0	 in the truth. They're it. The reason this department is set up and what they mean by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4827.8s	4827.8	 disinformation is they have hired her to push partisan political points. That's what's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4833.1s	4833.1	 on here. That's what disinformation is. Now it used to be that if you disagreed with somebody,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4838.2s	4838.2	 you just say, listen, I disagree with you or maybe you're an idiot, whatever you're wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4842.0s	4842.0	 But now the way that these debates are set up and the way they work is they don't just say you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4847.3s	4847.3	 wrong or that's not true. They try to label you as disinformation so you can get you censored.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4851.6s	4851.6	 And the point of hiring this disinformation czar is, is basically to censor that it's basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4858.2s	4858.2	 to shut down the debate. That is basically the whole point of the censorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4862.4s	4862.4	 Do you think there's any timing here with Elon Biden?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4865.0s	4865.0	 Yes, of course. It's, it's, well, it's, it's, there was a great tweet about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4870.2s	4870.2	 I love conspiracy sacks, by the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4872.0s	4872.0	 I don't think it's conspiracy theory. There was a great tweet about this that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4875.9s	4875.9	 that we live in a future where it's like a mashup of George Orwell and Ayn Rand. Cause here you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4882.6s	4882.6	 Elon Musk, the heroic lone entrepreneur trying to rescue freedom of speech. At the same time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4888.4s	4888.4	 you have this Orwellian ministry of truth being created by the federal government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4891.9s	4891.9	 So I mean, no awareness of naming. Yeah. It's just bizarre, but, but the disturbing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4896.7s	4896.7	 thing about it is disinformation governance board is such a dystopian name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4900.4s	4900.4	 The, the thing about it, that's a little bit scary here. I know you play the video of her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4905.6s	4905.6	 doing show tunes and it seems sort of silly, but the thing that's scary is that this is under the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4910.7s	4910.7	 Homeland security department. That's another weird wrinkle. Why is that there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4914.9s	4914.9	 It's, it's the most militarized department in our government. So it's really scary to put the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4919.4s	4919.4	 ministry of truth under the department that has all the soldiers, not the name of it, but it's close
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4926.1s	4926.1	 pretty darn close. Now, now why is it there? I'll tell you why. Because this was built up to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4930.9s	4930.9	 there was a shout out George Orwell. A couple of months ago is a news story that we might've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4936.3s	4936.3	 covered on this pod where the Homeland security department redefined disinformation to comprise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4944.8s	4944.8	 They said it represented an escalation of the terror threat level. So in other words,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4948.5s	4948.5	 they basically said that disinformation was tantamount to terrorism. Remember that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4952.7s	4952.7	 Didn't we talk about that? This is the payoff to that. First they define, they basically define the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4958.5s	4958.5	 other side as being disinformation of the debate as being disinformation. Then they define
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4963.4s	4963.4	 disinformation as, as basically terrorism. Then they have the Homeland security department,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4968.9s	4968.9	 which is supposed to be responsible for terrorism, create this ministry of truth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4972.0s	4972.0	 This is what's going on here. It's really weird. Just to remind everyone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4975.7s	4975.7	 there was concern in the last election. I I'm going to play devil's advocate, as I often find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4980.3s	4980.3	 myself doing here, that just to try and explain the world, that's the reason I often play this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4985.8s	4985.8	 role because I'm trying to understand the world. But there was a real concern that the Russian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4993.0s	4993.0	 government was using information warfare and propaganda through social media to influence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=4999.8s	4999.8	 voting. And that that is considered a security threat to the integrity of our elections. Therefore,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5007.2s	5007.2	 this is a Homeland security issue. And there is a question mark, of course, that everyone has on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5013.4s	5013.4	 how far are they going to go once you set this precedent? When would they ever stop in terms of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5018.2s	5018.2	 quote unquote, policing information and policing what's true and managing internal propaganda and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5023.4s	5023.4	 internal media delivered to us by the government? That's the other side of the coin. But the primary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5027.9s	5027.9	 side of the coin, the initial side, the initial representation that I think folks do have concerns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5032.5s	5032.5	 around is how do we keep foreign actors from creating misinformation campaigns that go viral
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5039.7s	5039.7	 and influence elections? And sex, I don't know if you think that that's a concern we should or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5043.4s	5043.4	 shouldn't have. But how would you address it if you were the president? And that was the the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5047.1s	5047.1	 challenge, you know, to like, how do we stop that from happening? Foreign actors interfering our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5051.5s	5051.5	 elections is certainly a concern we should have if it was actually happening on a big scale,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5056.7s	5056.7	 or in a meaningful way. I mean, this is basically look, this is basically a hoax. Okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5061.8s	5061.8	 John Durham is basically out there making indictments right now proving the extent of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5065.8s	5065.8	 this hoax. It started with the whole Steele dossier, which was a piece of campaign opposition

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5076.3s	5076.3	 are under indictment. And that's where this whole thing of Russian disinformation came from. And the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5081.8s	5081.8	 only proof for that thesis is that supposedly the Russians bought $100,000 of Facebook ads on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5087.8s	5087.8	 Facebook. So I'm not denying that that occurred, but it was relatively minor as a drop in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5093.3s	5093.3	 bucket of all the activity going on around. To be clear, to be clear, that was just the ads that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5098.2s	5098.2	 were bought with with like credit cards that said like, FSB on it. But who would know Facebook?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5104.8s	5104.8	 You probably didn't count all the number of credit cards that were stolen. I'm pretty sure the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5109.0s	5109.0	 Russians are capable of stealing john smith's credit card and using that to buy ads as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5112.5s	5112.5	 Well, I looked at those ads, I used seeing those ads, they were ludicrous, they weren't going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5116.2s	5116.2	 convince anybody of anything. I mean, they had like, Jesus and the devil arm wrestling each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5122.7s	5122.7	 And the Jesus figure was basically set and the you know, it was just absurd. I mean, the Jesus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5128.5s	5128.5	 figure was saying that it went to be clear, it happened. And you've now stepped back your position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5132.3s	5132.3	 on like, it just wasn't at scale to your opinion. I think I think, look, the the scale interference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5139.1s	5139.1	 in the election was committed by Big Tech. I mean, they censored the Hunter Biden story,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5144.3s	5144.3	 two weeks before the election, it turns out that's a completely true story that Hunter Biden has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5148.8s	5148.8	 extensive business dealings in Ukraine, we are now Yes, but we are now deeply involved in a war there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5156.5s	5156.5	 And that story, the electorate had the right to take that into account. Big Tech censored that story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5161.4s	5161.4	 So that can may respond to that, just to give people like making a very difficult decision,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5167.6s	5167.6	 you have to remember Trump asked Putin on stage to hack Hillary's emails, and they did. Then he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5173.2s	5173.2	 asked the Ukraine to take action against the Biden's, or he wouldn't give them support,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5178.8s	5178.8	 he was impeached for that. So if you put yourself in the and I'm not saying Twitter made the right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5183.5s	5183.5	 decision here, but there was and there was also sexual material, you know, people's nudes, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5188.4s	5188.4	 and hacked material and nudes are against the terms of service. So I think two things happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5193.7s	5193.7	 concurrently. One, listen, the people working at Twitter are 98% liberal, they don't want Trump,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5198.6s	5198.6	 they sort of an existential threat. And then two, they don't want to link to hacked material.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5204.2s	5204.2	 Oh, really? Hold on a second. Hold on. Let me finish this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5208.7s	5208.7	 No, I have to finish my point. The third point, and then I'll let you go is that in it, in addition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5212.8s	5212.8	 to all that, Hunter Biden is completely a grifter. Go. Okay, I agree with you on that one. So look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5218.6s	5218.6	 during the whole Canadian trucker thing, remember when all the people who contributed to those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5223.0s	5223.0	 Canadian truckers, they got docs, I mean, basically, there was a hacker who leaked all the people who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5227.7s	5227.7	 had donated and social networks were happy to print all that information. So this idea that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5233.7s	5233.7	 censor hacked information is nonsense. The libs of TikTok account just got docs by Taylor Lorenz.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5239.6s	5239.6	 Look, whether you think that was a good idea or not. The point is these principles are invoked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5243.5s	5243.5	 very selectively, when there's a story they want to suppress. And the New York Times and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5248.0s	5248.0	 Washington Post have both not come out and said that the laptop was real, it's been authenticated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5252.6s	5252.6	 the story was real. And this whole idea that it was disinformation, that was just invented. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5257.8s	5257.8	 it was just invented. Well, no, hacked. It wasn't that it was disinformation, it was potentially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5262.2s	5262.2	 hacked. And you and Trump, nothing was hacked. Here's the thing, Trump set the stage for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5266.6s	5266.6	 And the the the people at Twitter and Facebook, who also made these decisions, they were informed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5273.0s	5273.0	 by three later agencies, Department of Justice and FBI, etc. Hey, this is potentially hack material
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5278.1s	5278.1	 designed to interfere with the election. Listen, it also is true that Biden is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5281.9s	5281.9	 pressure. And other Democratic Party operatives just made up out a whole cloth that the Hunter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5287.8s	5287.8	 Biden story was disinformation. It was true. It's been acknowledged as true. The Washington Post
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5292.2s	5292.2	 says it's true. So hold on. So it can improve. No, it's not about improving it. Look, well, no,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5298.6s	5298.6	 no, you didn't hear my sentence. I think this is where social media can improve, which is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5302.2s	5302.2	 if they had to explain every one of these decisions they make in full in transparency,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5307.0s	5307.0	 I think that's something Elon could bring to this party, which is, if you're going to block
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5310.9s	5310.9	 something, we need to know why. And they'd never explain why and who made the decision. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5318.0s	5318.0	 that that transparency would benefit situations like this. If the FBI or FBI told them, this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5324.7s	5324.7	 hacked material, then they got to go to the DOJ and say, hey, you got to give us cover here. If
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5328.6s	5328.6	 this is in fact, hack material, you told us not to print it. We're not going to print it. But it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5332.9s	5332.9	 was just bizarre that one publication got dinged like the New York Post. It didn't-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5337.2s	5337.2	 The oldest newspaper in America. The oldest newspaper in America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5340.7s	5340.7	 It's also not the bastion of like-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5342.4s	5342.4	 It doesn't matter. That's not for you to decide. It's not for Twitter to decide. It's a legitimate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5345.8s	5345.8	 publication that had a true story. And it was relevant to the election and the American people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5349.7s	5349.7	 should have been able to take that into account. And people like Nina Jankovic or whatever, our new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5354.7s	5354.7	 czar of the Ministry of Truth, she was out in the forefront basically calling that story
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5359.7s	5359.7	 disinformation. Meanwhile, she's pushing the steel d'astier, which really was disinformation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5363.0s	5363.0	 You think if that story was confirmed, would Biden have won?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5365.9s	5365.9	 I don't know. I don't know the answer to that. But the point is that it shouldn't have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5369.5s	5369.5	 suppressed. That was election interference. Now, Elon came out this week and specifically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5376.7s	5376.7	 tweeted that, that that was basically a mistake. Jack also said it was a bad call.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5381.0s	5381.0	 Jack said it was a mistake too. And Elon repeated the same thing, that they shouldn't have done that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5384.8s	5384.8	 I think everybody can agree it's a bad call in hindsight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5387.0s	5387.0	 Yeah. Of course. But-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5388.6s	5388.6	 In hindsight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5389.8s	5389.8	 Right. But what was the reaction to what Elon said? He was accused by virtue of criticizing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5396.6s	5396.6	 the policy decision that Twitter made, that that was supposedly targeted harassment of the legal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5402.3s	5402.3	 council at Twitter who made the decision, who gets paid $17 million a year to make those decisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5407.3s	5407.3	 Do you guys see this debate? This happened last year, this last week. So the point is that if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5412.8s	5412.8	 criticize somebody who's on a certain side of the debate, that's harassment. But he'd even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5419.7s	5419.7	 mention her by name. This is how absurd this discourse has gotten.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5423.2s	5423.2	 Can I make a prediction?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5424.9s	5424.9	 Yes. Prediction's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5428.4s	5428.4	 I think people misunderstand Elon's incentives for buying Twitter. And I haven't talked to him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5433.7s	5433.7	 about this. So I'm just making a complete subjective prediction. I think he's going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5439.7s	5439.7	 buy Twitter. I think he's going to clean it up. I think he's probably going to generate something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5447.1s	5447.1	 like a 2X on this. We talked about how that's a good terminal valuation in six or seven years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5452.6s	5452.6	 That basically puts that asset worth at around $100 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5457.8s	5457.8	 In the meantime, he's going to open source as much as possible. I think he's going to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5461.8s	5461.8	 it very difficult for misinformation and disinformation to get very far. He said he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5466.6s	5466.6	 going to authenticate every human being that uses the platform. He said all of these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5470.6s	5470.6	 publicly already. And then here's the masterstroke. And again, this is just me speculating. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5475.6s	5475.6	 he's going to donate it into a foundation and a trust. And I think it'll be an incredibly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5481.4s	5481.4	 powerful competitive alternative to all these other for-profit businesses, because everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5485.8s	5485.8	 you guys are talking about is the incentives that get perverted when you have to layer economics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5491.7s	5491.7	 inside the New York Post, inside the Washington Post, inside the New York Times, the Wall Street
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5497.4s	5497.4	 Journal. Everything eventually devolves to clickbait, to hearsay, to doxing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5502.7s	5502.7	 to whatever can get you more revenue. But if you can take it off the table and run these things as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5509.1s	5509.1	 a public trust, you can actually win back a bunch of confidence. And a lot of these edge cases go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5514.2s	5514.2	 away. Now you would say, why would anybody do that? Well, I think the real answer is because then if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5519.2s	5519.2	 he were to donate it into a foundation, he'd get $100 billion credit that he could use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5523.9s	5523.9	 to offset the gains when SpaceX or Starlink go public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5527.4s	5527.4	 Interesting theory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5528.1s	5528.1	 Interesting theory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5528.7s	5528.7	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5529.6s	5529.6	 Well, I agree with everything except for the donation part, because he's raising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5533.4s	5533.4	 20-something billion from private equity partners and lenders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5536.3s	5536.3	 Well, he could pay off the debt and then donate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5537.0s	5537.0	 He'll pay the debt off. He'll own it 100%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5538.6s	5538.6	 I'm going to pay that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5539.6s	5539.6	 And he'll pay people a very fair living wage. And it'll attract people that want to seek out the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5545.1s	5545.1	 truth, that want to work in an apolitical environment. He's already said that 10% of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5550.0s	5550.0	 the extremes are both equally crazy. He's going to force this thing to be rational and predictable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5557.8s	5557.8	 It's an interesting prediction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5559.4s	5559.4	 I think it goes public again, and it goes to five times the valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5562.6s	5562.6	 Are we going to be able to ask him these questions in Miami?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5565.0s	5565.0	 Sure. Why not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5565.8s	5565.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5566.1s	5566.1	 So let me ask you guys a question. What would you do, because a lot of people have pointed out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5569.9s	5569.9	 in response to what has obviously become a very polarizing set of discussions this week around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5576.3s	5576.3	 what should be censored, what should be banned, what shouldn't, etc. Elon's going to let bullying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5581.1s	5581.1	 and hate speech kind of proliferate. Other people have said we need to release the restrictions and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5587.0s	5587.0	 let people say what they want to say. Freedom of speech has no bounds, etc. What do you guys think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5591.4s	5591.4	 about the argument that there does need to be constraints and boundaries set around things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5597.8s	5597.8	 related to health and safety? Meaning if someone is making calls to violent action,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5604.2s	5604.2	 should that be censored, Sachs? And how do you make that interpretation because it becomes a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5608.6s	5608.6	 fuzzy gray interpretation? And then separately, when there are scientific papers that say one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5613.6s	5613.6	 thing and someone says that's not true and says something else, how do you kind of decide whether
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5617.5s	5617.5	 or not that should be allowed or censored on the platform? Because I think those are two very key
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5622.6s	5622.6	 issues that-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5623.4s	5623.4	 Well, you got to take them separately. Let's do violence first. Sachs, there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5626.8s	5626.8	 plenty of precedent in law. Just explain the violence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5629.9s	5629.9	 Look, the biggest straw man around-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5632.1s	5632.1	 Because this was the whole Trump argument, right? It was like he was inciting violence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5635.0s	5635.0	 was the argument that was being made. But generally speaking, is that an appropriate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5639.3s	5639.3	 form of censorship on this private platform? And if so, how do you set that standard?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5643.7s	5643.7	 Let's start here with, you hear this argument a lot, which is that if Elon brings free speech back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5648.6s	5648.6	 to Twitter, then we're going to have all this horrible content on there. You're going to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5652.2s	5652.2	 violence, you're going to have racism, you're going to have harassment, you're going to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5656.1s	5656.1	 all these bad things on fraud. The truth of the matter is that it's really a straw man argument
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5661.6s	5661.6	 because what it's basically arguing is that free speech means anything goes, but free speech does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5666.0s	5666.0	 not mean anything goes. We have 230 years of Supreme Court case law basically discussing this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5673.4s	5673.4	 question of what speech is protected and what's not. And the Supreme Court has ruled that there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5678.2s	5678.2	 nine major categories of speech that are not protected by the First Amendment. Why? Because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5682.2s	5682.2	 that speech is considered to be dangerous in one degree or another. So for example, you can't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5688.2s	5688.2	 commit fraud like the archegos guy or whatever and then say, well, that speech was protected by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5693.4s	5693.4	 First Amendment. First Amendment doesn't protect fraud. First Amendment doesn't protect incitement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5697.4s	5697.4	 to commit violence or a crime. It doesn't protect fighting words. So you could ban all ethnic or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5706.3s	5706.3	 racial slurs on these social networks under the concept of fighting words. So I think if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5711.9s	5711.9	 actually look at Supreme Court case law, what I would do is I, instead of just making up the content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5718.3s	5718.3	 moderation policies as I went along, I would look at the people at the cases where people have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5722.9s	5722.9	 wrestling with these decisions for decades. And I would create a content moderation policy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5728.6s	5728.6	 inspired by First Amendment case law, where I would take these nine categories of sort of dangerous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5734.7s	5734.7	 speech or harmful speech, and I would operationalize those. So for example, you can't defame people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5740.4s	5740.4	 right? The First Amendment doesn't protect you against claims of defamation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5745.0s	5745.0	 Howard Bauchner Would you make people go to court though in order for them to take it down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5749.2s	5749.2	 John Svigel Right. So this is where the word
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5750.4s	5750.4	 operationalized really comes in. It's not practical for a social network to require a court-level
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5757.3s	5757.3	 burden of proof to prove defamation, right? So what I would do is I would say that if you are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5762.3s	5762.3	 a person who claims to be defamed, you could file a report on Twitter and provide the tweet and provide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5768.6s	5768.6	 you know, some explanation. And as long as it looks like a colorable claim of defamation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5774.2s	5774.2	 meaning the person is attacking you in a way that seems out of bounds, then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5778.6s	5778.6	 potentially that can be taken down. You don't have to subject it to a jury trial or something like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5782.8s	5782.8	 that. So what I would do is I wouldn't, you can't literally impose First Amendment case law, but I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5788.6s	5788.6	 would use it as the basis for defining a content moderation policy. Howard Bauchner Can I just say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5793.4s	5793.4	 something? I think one of the best things about being your friend is sometimes you say stuff that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5797.0s	5797.0	 is so powerfully smart and elegant, because it's so simple. Basically what Sacks said for everybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5803.6s	5803.6	 else, because this is how he's like, the PRD for content moderation has existed. It's called the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5809.2s	5809.2	 Constitution. It's just that nobody in any of these companies has taken an effort to actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5814.1s	5814.1	 try to write code that maps to this PRD, where the PRD is the Constitution, whose rights have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5820.1s	5820.1	 established for hundreds of years. John Svigel By PRD, you mean product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5823.0s	5823.0	 requirements document. Howard Bauchner Yeah, sorry, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5824.6s	5824.6	 John Svigel Yeah, that's what a product manager would use.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5826.1s	5826.1	 Howard Bauchner Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5826.5s	5826.5	 John Svigel Yeah, exactly. Instead of them making this up all as they go along, I would look to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5830.3s	5830.3	 categories of speech the Supreme Court has already ruled out as being dangerous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5833.8s	5833.8	
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5833.8s	5833.8	 John Svigel Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5834.4s	5834.4	 Howard Bauchner Let's just do the health one Sacks. So there's a scientific paper that says
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5840.2s	5840.2	 this drug doesn't cure COVID. And then someone goes on Twitter and says, take this drug, it cures COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5846.8s	5846.8	 What's the what's your and I know you're not obviously a constitutional lawyer at this point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5852.0s	5852.0	 in your career, but how would you kind of think about that? And how do you think that that would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5857.4s	5857.4	 ultimately resolve in this regulatory framework? John Svigel That's a debate that should exist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5862.5s	5862.5	 I mean, I don't know why we need to suppress that debate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5864.6s	5864.6	 Howard Bauchner So if someone says declaratively on Twitter, this drug will cure COVID,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5869.6s	5869.6	 which by the way, the trends and just to be clear, by the way, you know, the FDA actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5873.6s	5873.6	 regulates claims like that on boxes and material and in a commercial setting. And if you're making
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5878.3s	5878.3	 money off Twitter, you're getting a lot of followers, and then you make more money by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5881.4s	5881.4	 putting out a tweet that says, but you're not you're not making money off the drug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5884.5s	5884.5	 John Svigel Yeah, right. Exactly. Look, if the person is selling the drug,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5887.3s	5887.3	 Howard Bauchner Roche should never say that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5888.9s	5888.9	 John Svigel Right. So if someone went on Twitter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5890.6s	5890.6	 and they said, take this drug, it cures COVID. But there's a sign,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5893.4s	5893.4	 Howard Bauchner You're confusing facts and authority.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5895.3s	5895.3	 Twitter is riddled with people that have zero authority that spit out what they think are facts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5899.6s	5899.6	 John Svigel Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5900.2s	5900.2	 Howard Bauchner So I think I think what you're speaking to is something very different, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5903.6s	5903.6	 is if you're going to design a social network, I've been part of helping to design one. So let me just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5907.4s	5907.4	 give you my two cents on this topic. There are layers of decision making that need to go into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5912.4s	5912.4	 an algorithm to get to a sense of rank. Okay, rank means do we believe with some reasonable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5918.7s	5918.7	 probability distribution in some probability distribution that this thing is worth showing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5923.2s	5923.2	 to somebody else. And the way that you get there is through multiple layers. So there's obviously a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5928.3s	5928.3	 layer where you can get signal relative to the authenticity of the person and individual making
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5933.0s	5933.0	 the claim. Is it a bot? Is it a real person? Then there's a separate layer, which is how,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5938.0s	5938.0	 you know, roughly accurate do we think this is? Then there's another layer, which is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5942.0s	5942.0	 is this person believable in making all of those statements? And my point is there are different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5946.0s	5946.0	 subsystems you build for those things. He's already said all these algorithms are going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5950.3s	5950.3	 be open sourced. And what you're talking about is authority, you should allow people to say stupid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5955.6s	5955.6	 things. It's not illegal. John Svigel Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5957.5s	5957.5	 Howard Bauchner Yes, a person can be on a street quarter saying Jesus is the Son of God,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5961.4s	5961.4	 and he will save your soul. Sax doesn't have to believe him. And somebody can say that on Twitter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5966.3s	5966.3	 the issue here is, does it trend? And do you show to people the algorithm? And if you fix those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5971.0s	5971.0	 problems, then who cares if a person says, Hey, listen, or has an authority problem,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5975.4s	5975.4	 and a ranking problem, and the authority problem comes from the fact that there's all kinds of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5979.9s	5979.9	 long tail non human individuals in the system. So solve for identity, and this problem can get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5985.8s	5985.8	 easier solved and solve for trending. And if you guys were running Twitter, you would not put on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5990.6s	5990.6	 these COVID-19 warning, this is misinformation, and rely solely on CDC guidance and recommendations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=5997.4s	5997.4	 and FDA variables. When it comes to treatments and vaccines and risks and so on, I would let
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6002.2s	6002.2	 anyone say whatever they wanted. John Svigel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6003.9s	6003.9	 No, no, no. How often was the CDC wrong? Howard Bauchner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6006.7s	6006.7	 Yeah, I'm not arguing for the kids. I'm just trying to get clarity here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6010.3s	6010.3	 John Svigel Yeah, he's just asking the question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6011.5s	6011.5	 I would I would do is another use taxes, I would label it. And I would I wouldn't label it right or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6016.4s	6016.4	 wrong. I'd say, Ivermectin is a drug. Here's the Wikipedia page. Hold on. Here's the Wikipedia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6023.5s	6023.5	 page on Ivermectin. Let's say there's a lot of confusion about Ivermectin, which there was,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6028.0s	6028.0	 you could just put anytime anybody says the word of Ivermectin. Here's a sentence of what Ivermectin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6033.2s	6033.2	 is. Here's the Wikipedia page, the CDC page, the UK government's page, DHS, whatever, for more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6039.4s	6039.4	 information about this topic. So I just want to not warning. Yeah, I just wanted to learn more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6044.3s	6044.3	 Jaykal, I want to disagree with what you're proposing. Okay, because it is the topic de
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6048.4s	6048.4	 jour. It was the one off that then triggered the ability for everyone to bifurcate on their point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6054.6s	6054.6	 of view on what should or shouldn't be done, as opposed to having a universal standard that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6059.4s	6059.4	 universally applied. That doesn't speak specifically to just the COVID-19 pandemic, or just Ivermectin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6065.8s	6065.8	 or just what Trump said or didn't say. But each one of these things can and should be universally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6071.0s	6071.0	 standardized, and then universally communicated, and then treated with universal standards across
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6077.1s	6077.1	 everyone and every topic, rather than have each of these breakouts where you've got someone on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6081.3s	6081.3	 Twitter scratching their head saying this seems to be an important topic. Let's come in and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6085.4s	6085.4	 annotate it. Let's create a classification for this. And that's where everyone gets riled up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6090.3s	6090.3	 in my opinion. I think if there was a universal standard that was universally applied without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6094.2s	6094.2	 giving another example, give an example. Go ahead. Well, vaccines is another good example. But yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6100.1s	6100.1	 first of all, nobody contradicted the CDC more than the CDC itself. It constantly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6107.8s	6107.8	 put out revisions of its old opinions. First, it said that COVID was not spread human to human,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6113.0s	6113.0	 then it obviously said that it was. It basically was against masks, then it was for them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6117.6s	6117.6	 and on and on and on it went. The idea that you cannot criticize your government or an agency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6123.4s	6123.4	 of the government is absurd. But that is the type of censorship that was being leveled in these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6128.8s	6128.8	 social networks is that basically they are preventing us from criticizing the so-called
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6133.2s	6133.2	 experts. That is precisely the kind of censorship that should not exist on these networks. That is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6138.1s	6138.1	 precisely the kind of debate. What about labeling in the way I talked about it? Like the problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6142.2s	6142.2	 with labeling, the problem with labeling is once again, it's done selectively. And the people at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6147.0s	6147.0	 Twitter basically decide who they think is right in a debate. And they basically want to act as a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6152.1s	6152.1	 referee to raise the hand of one of the participants of the debate, raise their hand over their head
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6155.9s	6155.9	 and declare them the victor. Now, it's a lot better to label than to just censor the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6160.6s	6160.6	 side's point of view. But still, it is a form of soft censorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6164.1s	6164.1	 The labeling I described, which happens on our podcast on Spotify, where it says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6168.5s	6168.5	 here's the COVID information center for more information. And they give a range of... So if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6172.9s	6172.9	 it's executed in that way, do you oppose it? If there's a very confusing public interest going on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6178.2s	6178.2	 If you were to algorithmically post related stories or something like that, and it was done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6183.5s	6183.5	 in a completely fair and speech neutral way, and it was just as a feature of Twitter, fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6188.1s	6188.1	 But if you have employees at Twitter sitting around discussing issues and deciding who the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6192.8s	6192.8	 winner is in various debates, and then putting their thumb on the scale to tilt the debate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6197.5s	6197.5	 towards those people, that's not what they should be doing. Now, and that is basically what they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6202.2s	6202.2	 doing with censorship. If you look again, let's go back to this topic of misinformation, because this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6207.4s	6207.4	 is really the crux of the debate. Once again, on the basis of First Amendment case law, you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6213.4s	6213.4	 remove offensive material on Twitter on the basis that it is fighting words, it's a slur,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6220.5s	6220.5	 it's harassment, incitement to violence. It's fraud, inauthentic that the account is not who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6227.2s	6227.2	 they purport to be. You remove all the bots. So all that content can get removed. So what is really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6231.9s	6231.9	 left then? It is basically this idea of misinformation, this idea that we are going to declare one party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6240.1s	6240.1	 the victor in this debate. And I think that is what is so offensive about this mystery of truth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6244.7s	6244.7	 that Homeland Security is setting up is what's so offensive about the censorship that Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6249.2s	6249.2	 has been practicing, which is they are trying to end the debate, they're trying to say, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6253.3s	6253.3	 this is the person with the on the side of truth. And that is not what they should be doing. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6257.0s	6257.0	 up to the marketplace to decide what the truth is. All right, there you have it, folks. Do you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6264.6s	6264.6	 disagree with that? I agree with you. To your point, David, I do think in a situation where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6272.6s	6272.6	 the public good, and there's confusion in a situation, sending people to more information
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6278.6s	6278.6	 isn't a bad idea. I do think a lot of this, there were thumbs on the scales, and it wasn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6283.3s	6283.3	 transparent what was happening. I think if you add transparency, so I think every time there's an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6289.0s	6289.0	 action that's taken, it should say agent number and what their agent number is, took this action
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6293.8s	6293.8	 on this tweet, for this reason, and then data scientists can look at all the actions that occur,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6299.8s	6299.8	 and then say, Look, we're looking at this agent number. And here's their manager's agent number.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6304.7s	6304.7	 And here's why they took down this post. You know, that at least you could have a starting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6309.0s	6309.0	 point to figure out what's going on. We don't even have enough information to know what thumbs are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6314.1s	6314.1	 on what scales if at all or to what extent and I would like to see transparency first, so we could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6318.2s	6318.2	 have a more informed decision. And then sending people to trusted information sources, a group
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6323.1s	6323.1	 of them isn't a bad idea. I think what's trusted. Yeah, I mean, so to your point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6328.2s	6328.2	 you don't need to look to a podcaster, a social network or the government to find truth in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6334.3s	6334.3	 world, you have to have a process yourself. That's part of what this podcast is, is for people to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6339.0s	6339.0	 develop being part of being an adult. Yes, you have to come up with your own process of coming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6343.6s	6343.6	 to the truth. You could trust some people trust the government agencies, some people trust a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6347.9s	6347.9	 Joe Rogan or a podcast or this podcast, some people trust a folk singer, trust yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6353.9s	6353.9	 That's the number one thing you have to learn how to do as an adult in life,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6357.3s	6357.3	 taking all this information and make a reasonable decision to take ivermectin or to not take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6361.9s	6361.9	 ivermectin is a perfect example. People said there's no downside to it. People have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6366.6s	6366.6	 taking this drug forever and it's cheap. And then another group of people said, well, you're taking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6371.2s	6371.2	 horse medicine. It's like, no, that's something completely different. And the whole conversation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6376.6s	6376.6	 became I felt very easy to parse. When you think about your own research, your own research,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6382.3s	6382.3	 right? And talk to your doctor, do your own research, but you can't do your own research
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6386.4s	6386.4	 if you're not permitted to see everything. And, and you think about like with drugs, think about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6391.2s	6391.2	 how many drugs over the last 30, 40 years have become the basis for product liability lawsuits,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6396.6s	6396.6	 because they had unintended side effects or consequences. And they revised the use of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6400.3s	6400.3	 drugs or drugs were taken off the market. If people weren't allowed to question those things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6406.6s	6406.6	 because supposedly the experts had ruled on the issue and ended the debate, how would we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6411.7s	6411.7	 gotten a correction on that? How we've gotten to the truth. So just because the experts say something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6417.0s	6417.0	 doesn't mean that is true. There's pros and cons. We have kids getting tons of kids taking all kinds

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6432.7s	6432.7	 we don't know we're doing large scale experimentations on the population in real time with

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=57&t=6468.1s	6468.1	 Well, I saw I saw a longitudinal study that just came out that said, there are no caloric benefits
