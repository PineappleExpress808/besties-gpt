https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=510.3s	510.3	 Introducing it into the economy to smooth things out and to actually drive long-term growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=517.1s	517.1	 and it turns out that a bunch of government officials fell for it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=522.5s	522.5	 If you fast forward to 2022, so 14 years later, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=527.9s	527.9	 Governments around the world had printed something to the tune of about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=532.2s	532.2	 3035 odd trillion dollars of money into the economy that should have never been there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=538.7s	538.7	 So the thing to remember is like we have not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=541.7s	541.7	 necessarily just been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=543.8s	543.8	 Obfuscating true supply demand in the last six or eight months when we've been talking about a recession or inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=550.4s	550.4	 We've been actually doing it since 2008. It's just that it's been building up in the system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=555.8s	555.8	 So one of the things that we have to realize is that all of that money somehow needs to get destroyed in some way shape
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=562.6s	562.6	 Or form if the true economic equilibrium is meant to be found
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=567.3s	567.3	 What is true supply what is true demand in the absence of government sloshing money around?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=573.5s	573.5	 Trying to prop up things that should not be propped up or buying votes or all the griffs that these folks have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=580.4s	580.4	 Engaged in in the last, you know decade and a half have to get undone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=584.9s	584.9	 So that's the backdrop. So if you think about taking 30 trillion dollars out of the global economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=590.8s	590.8	 You know, you're talking about almost you know, I think it's 85 trillion is the world GDP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=596.8s	596.8	 So like, you know, it's it's it's almost half of an entire year's worth of global GDP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=602.4s	602.4	 It's gonna take three years probably of the slow meticulous, you know running off of money, you know, not reintroducing new money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=611.0s	611.0	 So it seems like we're at the beginning of the beginning of something that's gonna be long and drawn out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=615.2s	615.2	 Now that's separate from and that's separate from whether we're in a recession or not. That's just the bear market that we're in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=621.0s	621.0	 Right. And so you have to look at asset prices today as a microcosm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=626.7s	626.7	 of a much larger trend that has to be about fake money pushing asset prices up and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=632.8s	632.8	 now taking all that fake money out and finding out what the real price of something is and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=638.0s	638.0	 I just don't think that takes six months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=640.1s	640.1	 So for all the people that were you know fingers crossed hoping that this would be the end of it Fed raises 75
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=645.9s	645.9	 We're done with this. They're gonna raise 75 more. I just think that's not how it's probably gonna be it's gonna take you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=653.2s	653.2	 24 36 months that may mean the bottom doesn't happen for another 18 months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=658.6s	658.6	 I think it's a we're in for a lot of choppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=663.7s	663.7	 market action sex
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=665.8s	665.8	 three asset bubbles clearly all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=668.8s	668.8	 You know being impacted we had stocks looks like that story was pretty violent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=674.6s	674.6	 Then we had crypto this last two or three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=678.0s	678.0	 Weeks have been absolutely insane in terms of that asset bubble and now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=683.6s	683.6	 record high inventories for homes record
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=687.7s	687.7	 sales are now dipping below the average of the last 20 years and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=692.6s	692.6	 We're seeing mortgage origination just absolutely get crushed six percent mortgages just a couple of months ago. It was 2.x
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=701.2s	701.2	 For some folks. So when you look at those three asset bubbles, do you buy chamats? Hey, we're gonna see even more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=707.7s	707.7	 deprecation these for another 18 months possibly or do you think we've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=711.6s	711.6	 Taken such crazy action. This has come down so violently that we're now bouncing along the bottom bouncing along the bottom or 18 months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=717.7s	717.7	 Of more pain. Well the stock market especially growth stocks may have taken the majority of the carnage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=723.2s	723.2	 But you're right. There are other asset classes and I think we're gonna see the carnage start to rotate into those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=729.2s	729.2	 So you're right if you look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=731.4s	731.4	 Residential real estate now the prices are at the highest they've been relative to median income
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=737.9s	737.9	 Since something like 2006 2007 before that sort of great real estate crash that precipitated the Great Recession 2008
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=745.3s	745.3	 So I think there are gonna be more more shoes to drop. I just want to build on Chamos point about root causes here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=752.5s	752.5	 Milton Friedman once said that there's nothing quite so permanent as a temporary government program
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=756.3s	756.3	 The temporary government program was quantitative easing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=759.2s	759.2	 We had this great recession of 2008 that could have turned into a depression
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=763.4s	763.4	 They broke the glass in case of emergency. They started this QE, which is basically the government intervening to buy bonds in the market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=771.1s	771.1	 They had never done that before and they loaded up their balance sheet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=774.0s	774.0	 The crazy thing is that program was still continuing until last year. Why I mean it was like on cruise control and so last year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=781.8s	781.8	 It was it was continuing to last month and countries like Europe are still doing it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=787.4s	787.4	 9% inflation in Europe and they're still buying bonds, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=790.5s	790.5	 So you go back to last year the Fed bought 54% of the government's debt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=795.4s	795.4	 Despite the fact that the economy was growing at like 5% GDP that it was bouncing back really strongly from covid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=802.1s	802.1	 That you had the stock market at all-time highs and yet they were still intervening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=807.2s	807.2	 With this massive QE and then when we got the the surprise 5.1% inflation print last summer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=813.5s	813.5	 They didn't stop QE till the end of Q1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=816.1s	816.1	 So you're right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=817.0s	817.0	 They kept basically printing money and it's still going on and that's created massive distortions in the economy now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=822.9s	822.9	 So the Fed I would say is the number one culprit here and J-PAL is the number one culprit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=828.0s	828.0	 But the number two culprit is the Biden administration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=831.1s	831.1	 And I think Biden did three things very early on in the first few months of his presidency to effectively tank his presidency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=837.9s	837.9	 Number one he canceled our energy independence on his first day in office
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=842.1s	842.1	 Canceling the Keystone pipeline and making it much harder to drill and of course energy inflation is the one factor in this sort of overall inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=850.2s	850.2	 Number two he pushed through that last two trillion of stimulus on straight party lines the ARP the American Rescue Plan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=857.6s	857.6	 After Larry Summers said economists in his own party said this is gonna create inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=862.0s	862.0	 Don't do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=863.1s	863.1	 And then the third thing is and no one really talks about this is that Biden could have used diplomacy in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=869.7s	869.7	 2021 to basically find an off-ramp to this Ukraine crisis before it turned into a full-fledged war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=875.4s	875.4	 And if you listen to the economists the international development economists like Jeffrey Sachs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=881.1s	881.1	 He basically says that Biden pulled his cabinet said listen should we negotiate and compromise with the Russians?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=887.5s	887.5	 They all said no and Biden handed down the order. We will not compromise with the Russians
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=892.9s	892.9	 So now we have this massive war in Ukraine that's fueling food and energy inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=898.3s	898.3	 It's gonna take his presidency and I don't even think there was any debate about this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=903.9s	903.9	 We may not be negotiating against Russia, but we're enabling them to print
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=908.5s	908.5	 enormous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=910.3s	910.3	 Surpluses meaning I don't know if you guys saw but there was an article today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=914.6s	914.6	 Janet Yellen is traveling around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=917.8s	917.8	 basically convincing folks to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=920.6s	920.6	 Not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=921.5s	921.5	 include Russian oil from a bunch of import bans so that these Russian oil tankers can be insured why so that they can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=929.7s	929.7	 Sell this oil to places like China and India etc. The rubles on a five-time five-year high
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=935.0s	935.0	 The rules at a five-year high we push for all these sanctions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=938.3s	938.3	 Europe gets on board and says we're gonna do it and we're gonna take the lumps and then we go around Europe and basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=944.0s	944.0	 Say well, we kind of want to fight this proxy war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=946.0s	946.0	 But at the same time we want to try to fix inflation and we didn't mean to cause this and it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=951.5s	951.5	 Completely disorganized what's happening? Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=953.4s	953.4	 So if you had six minutes in the pool for when sacks would blame Biden for the economy you win
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=959.7s	959.7	 Who do you blame?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=962.8s	962.8	 Quantitative easing starting in 2008 so that that goes over a couple of presidents and I guess the question I would have for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=967.8s	967.8	 Sacks is how much of the spending the freewheeling spending, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=971.5s	971.5	 You know was from the previous administration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=974.0s	974.0	 It's it does learning is a bipartisan problem. There's no question about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=977.0s	977.0	 But what I want to make sure that we point that out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=978.7s	978.7	 Yeah, for sure and Republicans only seem to find their principles on spending where there's a Democrat in the White House
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=983.1s	983.1	 I totally get it and I would like to see more fiscal responsibility regardless of which party is in power
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=988.8s	988.8	 And I like to see the Republicans less be less hypocritical in their principles on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=993.5s	993.5	 But look perfect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=994.9s	994.9	 Here's the thing the economy was bouncing back strongly last year and Biden still pushed for this last two trillion of spending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1000.8s	1000.8	 And then a 1.2 trillion more and I'm gonna do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1003.9s	1003.9	 And then remember the 4 trillion a build back better where man can save themselves exactly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1009.0s	1009.0	 I mean, what would if what would that have looked like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1011.7s	1011.7	 Freeburg you haven't spoken yet

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1093.0s	1093.0	 to make liquidity to make cash available
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1096.7s	1096.7	 To banks who ultimately make it available to businesses in such a way that there's enough cash in the system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1103.6s	1103.6	 That the businesses grow and that people have capital to invest in growth while keeping inflation at 2%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1109.5s	1109.5	 So their long-term target is 2% inflation and it's also correct me if I'm wrong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1114.2s	1114.2	 Making sure that there's enough cash to support economic growth. So remember last year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1119.1s	1119.1	 You'll remember Stan Druckenmiller was very public about how insane it was that the Federal Reserve was still buying bonds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1126.5s	1126.5	 And so there's one way to introduce cash into the system is to make cash available as a loan to banks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1132.5s	1132.5	 And then those you know banks use that money to loan to businesses and it makes its way through the economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1136.5s	1136.5	 Another way is for the Federal Reserve to step in and actually buy bonds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1140.6s	1140.6	 Freeing up the money that other people would be otherwise using to buy bonds to go and invest in other things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1145.4s	1145.4	 so they're effectively forcing liquidity into the market by taking bonds out of the market and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1150.0s	1150.0	 Last summer or q2 of last year Druckenmiller was pounding the table saying guys the economic

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1162.2s	1162.2	 relative to how much inflation there is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1164.7s	1164.7	 Indicates that we should stop buying bonds and we should stop injecting liquidity into the markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1168.6s	1168.6	 This makes no sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1170.0s	1170.0	 It is nonsensical and there was no strong point of view from the Fed at the time other than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1174.4s	1174.4	 There was uncertainty about the bounce back of the from the recession from kovat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1178.4s	1178.4	 There was uncertainty about what else was happening in the economy and yada yada
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1181.7s	1181.7	 But the the numbers the economic indicators were showing very clearly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1185.1s	1185.1	 The economy is growing in a robust pace low unemployment and inflation is starting to pick up. Holy crap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1191.8s	1191.8	 It's time to cool it off and the Fed made a judgment call and their judgment call really kind of was to keep going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1198.0s	1198.0	 And then we end up in this massive runaway inflationary problem where if you keep too much liquidity in the system for too long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1203.1s	1203.1	 You have inflation even if you have economic growth and now by pulling the money out of the system super super fast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1209.1s	1209.1	 We reduce the inflationary effects potentially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1212.1s	1212.1	 But we take the economy because now all this money coming out of the market means people are spending less and buying less and businesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1218.5s	1218.5	 Have less to borrow the borrowing costs are high and then that that's that's the big vacuum. Hold on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1222.8s	1222.8	 Let me go to Chamath and then Saxon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1224.6s	1224.6	 The rate the rate at which we pull the money out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1226.9s	1226.9	 Which has had to be really really fast over the last few weeks can cause a recession and that's the biggest concern right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1232.9s	1232.9	 Is will that actually trigger a massive recession or not that everyone's watching?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1236.5s	1236.5	 So Chamath, I guess act one of the things we need to clarify here is the actual mandate of the Fed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1241.4s	1241.4	 My was under the understanding that the Fed really was there to make sure of maximum employment and that you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1248.5s	1248.5	 Low interest loans were available and price stability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1251.7s	1251.7	 These are the were the stated goals for a long time low interest rates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1255.3s	1255.3	 Capital capital is available for the economy to grow with moderate rates without exceeding inflation of 2%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1260.9s	1260.9	 That's okay. So maximum employment price stability was also in there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1265.2s	1265.2	 I should be growth because remember we can't ever pay our debt if our GDP is not growing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1269.0s	1269.0	 Okay, well minimizing while keeping inflation below 2%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1272.2s	1272.2	 Chamath whatever point you want to make feel free to make but also I was just wanted to know from you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1276.1s	1276.1	 Where did the Fed go wrong with their mandate if at all here because we do have maximum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1281.7s	1281.7	 We have out of control price stability. Look, here's the thing you I think we have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1287.8s	1287.8	 also be sensitive to the fact that the Fed operates on a certain class of data and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1293.7s	1293.7	 That data in the 21st century is pretty pathetic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1296.8s	1296.8	 Nick you can probably find this but there was an article
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1299.2s	1299.2	 I think it was in the New York Times

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1335.7s	1335.7	 Inflation really only occurs when a good or a service trades hands for money, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1340.5s	1340.5	 And you calculate what did that thing trade at the day before and what is the trade for today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1345.8s	1345.8	 So you could get an absolute precise sense of it instead we do this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1349.9s	1349.9	 Random sampling thing and it's subjective humans. So if you read this article your takeaway will be oh my god
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1356.8s	1356.8	 This is very rickety and it drives an enormous hammer that we use to try to manage the economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1363.3s	1363.3	 That's the first thing. I think you need to buckle your seat belt because the next three four or five months of CPI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1370.2s	1370.2	 Will probably be very very bad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1373.1s	1373.1	 Seven eight nine percent why there are a handful of components that have gotten completely run away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1379.8s	1379.8	 Number one, the biggest one is rent and so rent works on a three-month lag
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1383.7s	1383.7	 We're gonna reintroduce what the true owners equivalent rent is into CPI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1388.9s	1388.9	 So we can already forecast that CPI going up oil is at 105 bucks a barrel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1394.0s	1394.0	 Russia is basically trying to break the back of Europe by now messing with their nat gas supplies

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1412.5s	1412.5	 What you have is unfortunately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1415.1s	1415.1	 Rampant runaway costs that really have no mechanism to get back in check in the absence of some real

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1433.3s	1433.3	 So in the absence of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1435.3s	1435.3	 Prices are going to continue to go up. And so what does the Fed do? How does it throw away?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1441.5s	1441.5	 What little credibility it has left
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1444.4s	1444.4	 When there's eight and nine percent inflation prints and saying we think we're done for right now. You can't do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1450.5s	1450.5	 So they will overcorrect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1453.4s	1453.4	 Because there is just going to be so much pressure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1457.2s	1457.2	 for them to act
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1459.2s	1459.2	 all roads I think lead to lower equity prices and I think what David said astutely is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1466.1s	1466.1	 We've seen the first wave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1468.1s	1468.1	 But now it has to touch all these other areas. For example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1471.8s	1471.8	 We have gotten totally drunk on debt as a country one of the most

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1486.9s	1486.9	 Right. These are dangerous. These are sketchy companies that are sort of like, you know teetering on insolvency at times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1493.9s	1493.9	 Where private equity comes in levers up the balance sheet with debt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1497.7s	1497.7	 They price it right to the edge of what's legally allowed or what's financeable and then they go do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1503.6s	1503.6	 But that's all assuming the economy continues to grow and so if all of a sudden you have some recessionary forces or prices go up

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1517.7s	1517.7	 So we're dealing with some really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1519.8s	1519.8	 Most Americans have most of their net worth tied up in real estate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1522.8s	1522.8	 And if we see a 30 30 percent correction in real estate, it could be a real problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1526.7s	1526.7	 Particularly with rising interest rates inability to refinance sacks. The dual mandate is hey keep inflation 2% and then keep the unemployment rate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1534.9s	1534.9	 Reasonable the unemployment rates amazing with still so many jobs out there even with these layoffs. In fact, one might argue we made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1542.6s	1542.6	 Too many jobs available to the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1544.6s	1544.6	 And not taking advantage of these amazing jobs out there. Where do you see this going sacks now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1549.6s	1549.6	 That we can't seem to get inflation under control and people are looking at their 401ks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1555.2s	1555.2	 They feel a lot poorer, but is the demand side gone yet? Have have consumers decided?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1560.6s	1560.6	 I'm not going to buy the next house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1562.6s	1562.6	 I'm not going to buy the next house. I'm not going to buy the next house. I'm not going to buy the next house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1566.6s	1566.6	 I'm not going to buy the next house. I'm not going to buy the next house. I'm not going to buy the next house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1570.7s	1570.7	 Have consumers decided I'm not going to buy the next house. I'm not going on this vacation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1576.7s	1576.7	 Six dollar gas makes no sense. Seven dollar gas makes no sense. I'm not going to go on this weekend excursion. I'm staying home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1582.8s	1582.8	 Yeah, I mean look consumer confidence just had the biggest drop I think in 40 or 50 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1588.0s	1588.0	 Um, we if you look at like right track wrong track polling for the country only something like 24 percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1595.2s	1595.2	 Believes that the country's on the right track right now if you poll people are we in a recession?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1600.4s	1600.4	 And they don't look at like, you know the quarter-over-quarter growth. They just look at what they're feeling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1604.2s	1604.2	 56 of the country says we're already in recession. It's about 70 Republicans about 50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1610.3s	1610.3	 Democrats, so the country is already hurting people already feeling it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1614.9s	1614.9	 And this is it's psychological sacks or are they actually making decisions now to spend less?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1620.9s	1620.9	 Well, I think it's both
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1621.9s	1621.9	 I mean you start with the real inflation and people feel it and they also hear about it in the media and then they start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1627.5s	1627.5	 To adjust their their decisions and this is the problem with fixing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1631.1s	1631.1	 Yeah, this is a problem with fixing an inflation problem is that it's based on expectations. So once people start to expect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1637.2s	1637.2	 Inflation then businesses have to start operating as if there's going to be an inflation rate next year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1641.1s	1641.1	 So they have to start raising prices and it's actually very hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1645.5s	1645.5	 To put the horse back in the barn and this is why I think the fed is probably more likely to overshoot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1652.0s	1652.0	 On raising rates is because if they really want to stop inflation now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1655.5s	1655.5	 They really have to slam on the brakes and then that's going to lead to a recession and if they don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1660.3s	1660.3	 Then we end up with like a chronic sort of stagflationary situation where you get lower growth and inflation persists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1667.2s	1667.2	 So it's a bunch of bad options right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1669.5s	1669.5	 And I think to the point freeburgers making earlier, you know this ray dahlio piece that he just published as a blog on linkedin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1676.7s	1676.7	 He said look what you want is a fed that is alert at the wheel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1681.2s	1681.2	 And gently applies the accelerator or the brakes based on what's happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1685.9s	1685.9	 And instead what we had is the fed was asleep at the wheel. They should have started reacting gently to inflation last summer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1693.0s	1693.0	 Instead they waited nine months and now they're slamming on the brakes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1697.5s	1697.5	 And this is a bunch of bad options. I think you know, we are going to have a recession the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1703.0s	1703.0	 Can I just make one suggestion? I want to put this out there because I sent it on our text and I anyone that's listening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1708.7s	1708.7	 in dc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1709.9s	1709.9	 Please think about how we can change the way the federal reserve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1713.7s	1713.7	 operates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1714.9s	1714.9	 But it doesn't make sense to have humans with subjectivity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1719.9s	1719.9	 Applying their subjectivity to a set of as chamath pointed out in frequent data that comes in chunks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1726.3s	1726.3	 It comes in spurts and only having a mechanism of changing rates by 25 percent each month
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1731.7s	1731.7	 Or sorry 25 basis points once a month. We should have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1735.9s	1735.9	 continuous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1737.1s	1737.1	 real-time monitoring of economic data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1740.2s	1740.2	 And software or ai or some sort of informed set of models should then predict
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1746.1s	1746.1	 What inflation and economic growth rates will be as that data comes in react in real time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1751.5s	1751.5	 And on a daily basis, we should be adjusting the overnight rate in a one basis point increment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1757.1s	1757.1	 So we can have the ability to more quickly more efficiently and in a higher resolution way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1762.3s	1762.3	 Yeah, smooth it out a smoother way in a higher resolution way make these adjustments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1765.7s	1765.7	 It's silly that we're still operating the way we did in a pre-digital age as it is with a lot of industries and a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1770.3s	1770.3	 Of bureaucracy, but in this case, it's particularly prudent and it's becoming particularly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1774.7s	1774.7	 important and relevant as we're seeing right now with the stagflation risk that we're facing where we could have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1779.7s	1779.7	 Massive inflation and recession at the same time because if we had made smaller adjustments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1784.8s	1784.8	 Every day for a period of time as these economic data indicated that we should be making them more quickly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1790.4s	1790.4	 We would not be in this problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1792.0s	1792.0	 And I don't think that having humans and their judgment should necessarily be the way that we drive this thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1796.6s	1796.6	 Listen, we don't need them making daily adjustments. I don't think the fed can fine-tune an outcome like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1801.5s	1801.5	 I just think that they can't be asleep at the wheel for nine months. I mean we should have ai running this freaking thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1806.6s	1806.6	 I mean, what's listen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1807.4s	1807.4	 I I don't I actually don't think when you said that you know congress needs to somehow change the the way the fed does business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1813.0s	1813.0	 I actually think that the fed has the correct mandate which is the dual mandate of considering inflation and unemployment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1820.2s	1820.2	 We shouldn't be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1821.6s	1821.6	 Basically junking that up by adding a bunch of mandates and actually the administration has been trying to add mandates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1827.1s	1827.1	 They basically gave the fed a mandate around climate change. They gave them a mandate. Yeah. No, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1832.4s	1832.4	 Don't change the mandate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1835.0s	1835.0	 Multi-variable this is complex the tools the tools should change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1839.2s	1839.2	 Yeah, right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1840.0s	1840.0	 We really want a focused fed and I think the administration has been politicizing the fed by giving them a bunch of mandates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1846.4s	1846.4	 Look if you want to pursue those policies do it in hhs do it in the interior department
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1851.1s	1851.1	 Don't basically confuse the fed and make them pursue climate change or equity or what have you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1856.4s	1856.4	 I mean that is just bad that is not their remit right their their remit is controlling inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1862.1s	1862.1	 I really think this just comes down to the fact that for nine months they sat on their hands
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1866.4s	1866.4	 And ignored the inflation evidence remember this word transitory, you know, we heard so much last year about inflation being transitory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1873.2s	1873.2	 How did they know that you know, why didn't they start?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1876.2s	1876.2	 Rethinking this quantitative easing the headline from the wall street journal says it all how the inflation rate is measured
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1883.0s	1883.0	 477 government workers at grocery stores. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1886.8s	1886.8	 Software should be taking data from different feeds and software can learn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1890.9s	1890.9	 I don't I don't agree with you and what are the predictors of inflation and what are the predictors of growth?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1895.5s	1895.5	 And make a recommendation. I don't agree with you that it needs to be real time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1899.5s	1899.5	 In fact, I think it would do more harm than good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1901.5s	1901.5	 But I do think that we can know these things without sampling in such a porous way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1907.6s	1907.6	 And you know, you can work with private companies to give you the feed of data to to allow you to do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1913.4s	1913.4	 And now you know, we're going to look we've had a system of over correcting and under correcting for years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1920.3s	1920.3	 The problem is the stakes get higher and higher as the economy grows and becomes more complicated and we have more leverage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1926.8s	1926.8	 And we have more leverage and we have more industries that are leveraged and more asset classes that are leveraged like housing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1933.0s	1933.0	 Because if you're off by even a few points you could take everything. I also want to tell you guys a quick story
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1940.0s	1940.0	 one of the most interesting canaries in the coal mine of all of this was two days ago and what uh happened to facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1950.1s	1950.1	 And this sort of ties a lot of this stuff together in terms of like economics inflation asset prices equity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1957.0s	1957.0	 Tech we should then we can try to talk about non
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1960.8s	1960.8	 Sort of you know big tech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1962.8s	1962.8	 But the everybody was saying oh gosh, the market's gonna rip on the open
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1967.0s	1967.0	 You know, we were closed for juneteenth and then on tuesday the market, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1971.0s	1971.0	 The s&p was up like 250 basis points 2.5 percent and the nasdaq was also up, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1977.2s	1977.2	 Call it maybe 300 basis points roughly but facebook was down like 400 points, right? So it's a big spread
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1984.3s	1984.3	 And why is that and I was like this makes no sense to me what is going on with this price action?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1988.8s	1988.8	 Everything was up apple was up google was up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1991.6s	1991.6	 And so I called around and you know, I was like why is this happening? And this is the best explanation I got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=1998.4s	1998.4	 When you look at who the incremental buyer is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2001.6s	2001.6	 In the stock market it tends to give you a sense of whether prices can go up or will continue to go down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2008.3s	2008.3	 and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2010.2s	2010.2	 poorest informed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2012.1s	2012.1	 Buyer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2013.2s	2013.2	 Tends to be retail and the most informed buyer tends to be these very large institutional hedge funds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2019.4s	2019.4	 Right, so there's a spectrum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2021.6s	2021.6	 and uh facebook is an example of one of the of big tech that is poorly owned by retail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2028.8s	2028.8	 So it's mostly owned by smart money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2031.7s	2031.7	 And the case that smart money makes for owning facebook is that it's got an extremely cheap price to earnings ratio
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2038.1s	2038.1	 So you must own it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2040.8s	2040.8	 And what they said was that they you know looking at the tea leaves of consumer demand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2046.3s	2046.3	 What they actually re underwrote was that actually?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2049.6s	2049.6	 It's not that the price to earnings was cheap. It's that the e in pe was just wrong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2054.4s	2054.4	 And if they pass through all of these increases in inflation and you know their earnings expectations into facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2060.4s	2060.4	 It's actually more like fair value at a lower price. That's why they sold it so much on a day where the market was up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2066.6s	2066.6	 Now, why is that important?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2068.4s	2068.4	 Well, eventually you're going to touch all these other stocks as well that are going to go through earnings revisions in this recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2075.8s	2075.8	 This is where I think wall street has done a very poor job on behalf of retail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2080.0s	2080.0	 If you look at the average estimates of earnings, you will be shocked to hear that wall street actually has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2086.7s	2086.7	 This year being record earnings next year earnings continuing to go up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2092.2s	2092.2	 How is that even possible? Well, how is that? How is that if you're sitting here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2096.6s	2096.6	 How do you see how do you see earnings continuing to go up into these prints like this when you cannot pass through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2104.9s	2104.9	 You know 80 90 increases in energy and cogs and whatnot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2108.5s	2108.5	 How does it happen? I think the the what people would say is maybe they're going to lower their costs and so with layoffs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2114.8s	2114.8	 And and lowering salaries and lowering spend on advertising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2118.8s	2118.8	 You know the earn it the e could go up if people because start belt tightening and then we start having
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2124.7s	2124.7	 Companies that are being run, you know, just more you'll have to sell fewer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2129.6s	2129.6	 You'll have to sell fewer things because there'll be fewer people with jobs to buy things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2134.0s	2134.0	 But we have 10 million job openings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2135.6s	2135.6	 So this is the weird thing about this recession is because we haven't let a lot of people immigrate into the country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2140.6s	2140.6	 But is that so many jobs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2142.6s	2142.6	 Is that what you think the consensus view on wall street is that basically a bunch of people get fired?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2147.6s	2147.6	 And so that's why earnings continue to go up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2149.5s	2149.5	 Well, they stop hiring for two years in advance right facebook said they were hiring for like 2024 their hiring plans were looking out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2156.6s	2156.6	 Two years. So now if they go on a hiring freeze, maybe there's you know, and that's their number one cost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2161.6s	2161.6	 I'm just putting out a theory i'll give you the counterfactual. I think wall street's wrong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2165.5s	2165.5	 Okay, and I think that earnings are going to go down this year and will definitely go down in 23
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2171.6s	2171.6	 And so I think what probably happens is the entire world of equities needs to get repriced at a lower price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2179.5s	2179.5	 And in that it's going to put enormous pressure on these cash burning non-profitable tech companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2185.0s	2185.0	 Well, that's for sure but in the ones that are profitable chamath
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2187.7s	2187.7	 They're aware of this facebook just cancelled like two of their prototypes they were working on to save money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2192.4s	2192.4	 So that whole 10 billion dollars into you know, vr. I think they're trying to make that number look smaller smaller
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2198.8s	2198.8	 sax what do you think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2200.7s	2200.7	 Well, I think you're bringing up a really interesting point with this the 10 million, you know job openings and now that that number is coming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2207.7s	2207.7	 Down really fast as companies close open wrecks and they basically freeze hiring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2212.5s	2212.5	 So that number is going to come down very very fast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2214.6s	2214.6	 but one of the major contributors to inflation is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2219.2s	2219.2	 The labor force participation has been very low millions of people left the labor force
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2223.9s	2223.9	 during covid as a result of the stimulus checks and the freezing of rent and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2229.6s	2229.6	 Evictions. I mean look rents the number one expense if they don't have to pay rent for a couple of years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2234.4s	2234.4	 A lot of them may not work or may not work as much so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2237.2s	2237.2	 We've had this problem where we really need about two million people to re-enter the labor force
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2243.2s	2243.2	 And if you describe inflation as too much money chasing too few goods
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2248.0s	2248.0	 We need to increase production and productive capacity and when you have millions of people dropping out of the labor force
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2254.2s	2254.2	 You've got less goods and services being produced that people want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2258.2s	2258.2	 So just reducing the money supply is not going to get us out of this mess
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2262.8s	2262.8	 We also need to improve productive capacity just to put a number on that. We peaked in the 1999 era
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2270.0s	2270.0	 It's 67 percent of participation of labor force
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2273.7s	2273.7	 And then it's been down in this low 60 61 62 and it continues to be low
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2278.4s	2278.4	 But that is the solution here. We get that seven percent that gap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2282.7s	2282.7	 You can't just fix the demand side because if all you do is fix the demand side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2286.5s	2286.5	 What you're doing is you're killing the economy to reduce demand in order to bring it down prices
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2291.6s	2291.6	 That's very painful. It's all pain, but what you also have to do is fix the supply side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2296.4s	2296.4	 You have to increase the availability of all the critical inputs into the economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2301.2s	2301.2	 So labor obviously is one of them but also critical resources like energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2307.1s	2307.1	 You know oil natural gas and so on and that goes back to fixing the supply chain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2311.1s	2311.1	 Hopefully getting a resolution of the situation in ukraine the war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2314.9s	2314.9	 Um, so if we could fix those things it's a way to improve the economy without creating more pain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2320.4s	2320.4	 Freberg if the prices of just daily living of which transportation and housing and health care are now the top three I believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2328.3s	2328.3	 Um groceries and health care. I think have flip-flopped a couple times in the last decade in terms of costs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2333.5s	2333.5	 If those things go up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2335.2s	2335.2	 Would that make people want to go back to work to pay for those things or does it create capitulation where people say?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2340.0s	2340.0	 I'm moving in with my cousin. I'm going to lower my balance sheet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2342.8s	2342.8	 What is your prediction there are more people going to go to work or do we still have this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2346.7s	2346.7	 You know call it 10 million people in the country who just don't want to go to work i've mentioned this in the past
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2351.3s	2351.3	 But I think there's more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2354.4s	2354.4	 There's another kind of interesting outcome of this we've had several months in a row of pretty significant increase in consumer credit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2362.3s	2362.3	 And I think the reason is things are getting more expensive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2366.4s	2366.4	 people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2367.6s	2367.6	 Generally do not like to reduce their spend on stuff or their living their lifestyle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2374.2s	2374.2	 Once you get used to a lifestyle like going out to dinner once a week or going to the movies every week and you create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2379.0s	2379.0	 A budget you create an experience around that a model around that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2382.9s	2382.9	 It's very hard to say okay. I got to cut budget now and I got to reduce my life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2386.8s	2386.8	 I would rather say i'm going to keep doing that or at least there's some inertia or some momentum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2390.6s	2390.6	 To keep spending on the things that you've been spending on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2393.8s	2393.8	 And the way you do that in a model where you don't have as much income or you have less income and things are getting more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2398.0s	2398.0	 expensive as you take on more debt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2400.2s	2400.2	 And so there is a little bit of a nervousness that I have had that people's response generally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2407.2s	2407.2	 um, the consumer response
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2409.6s	2409.6	 to inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2411.2s	2411.2	 and uh to a uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2413.5s	2413.5	 Uh kind of a uh shifting. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2416.6s	2416.6	 Uh income environment like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2418.8s	2418.8	 Is not necessarily to cut as quickly but take on more debt and keep um keep buying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2424.7s	2424.7	 And so I I am a little nervous about that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2426.4s	2426.4	 But I do think obviously at some point everyone has to figure out ways to generate income there have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2431.9s	2431.9	 A lot of these kind of ancillary markets that are typically the first to go these extra services markets where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2437.5s	2437.5	 People, you know have found other ways to make money side hustles and whatnot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2442.1s	2442.1	 Um that may or may not be as robust as they have been historically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2446.8s	2446.8	 And so people may need to go back for more secure stable income
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2451.2s	2451.2	 And and these jobs get filled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2453.0s	2453.0	 I look I mean as we all know there's an opportunity and this is the whole concept I think behind build back better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2459.5s	2459.5	 It's not super
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2461.6s	2461.6	 Thoughtful in terms of the approach. Um, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2464.5s	2464.5	 Based on my understanding of where that money is supposed to go because it doesn't create long-term jobs, but there is an opportunity to build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2471.0s	2471.0	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2472.1s	2472.1	 New manufacturing and new infrastructure jobs in the u.s right now that could enable a healthy transition here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2478.1s	2478.1	 But that legislation needs to be done smart. It can't be done with this like hey, let's build a bunch of bridges
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2483.2s	2483.2	 And then a bunch of contractors make a bunch of money and no one has any long-term jobs out of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2486.9s	2486.9	 We've got to find ways to spend money on creating long-term
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2489.9s	2489.9	 sustainable, um, you know new industry here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2493.4s	2493.4	 Yeah, job openings 11.4. It's come down about six or seven percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2497.7s	2497.7	 So, you know, it's going to be trailing but it's for sure we're seeing it in our industry with the hiring freezes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2503.6s	2503.6	 That then you know, we're going to work through those open jobs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2507.0s	2507.0	 What are the chances that inflation gets under control?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2510.8s	2510.8	 In the next year and should the fed go for like the one percent slam on the brakes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2515.3s	2515.3	 There was some talk about that obviously they went for a lot of the remember a lot of the elements that we were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2521.1s	2521.1	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2522.0s	2522.0	 Kind of saying oh my gosh, I can't believe the climate prices. So, you know wheat is down. I think 30% lumber is down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2528.3s	2528.3	 50%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2529.7s	2529.7	 Uh gas prices are coming down. So, you know, there are some of these um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2534.9s	2534.9	 You know commodity spikes that we've experienced over the past couple of quarters, uh, particularly recently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2540.8s	2540.8	 That are really that have had a significant part of the fueling effect on the inflationary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2545.5s	2545.5	 Uh trickle down into ultimately end products and whatnot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2549.5s	2549.5	 And those are coming down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2551.1s	2551.1	 um, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2553.0s	2553.0	 There's a real question of how quickly that flows through the economy and flows through to the price of goods
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2558.0s	2558.0	 Uh that that consumers ultimately end up paying for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2561.2s	2561.2	 The gas prices right now are the biggest concern, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2564.7s	2564.7	 Like unless you can get gas prices under control that always always has a massive impact on spending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2570.9s	2570.9	 On consumer spending which drives a recessionary cycle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2574.4s	2574.4	 And so the if i'm the biden administration i'm first and foremost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2578.2s	2578.2	 I don't care about the general inflationary indicators as much as I care about getting the price of gas down. That is a super
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2583.8s	2583.8	 Super critical number to fix
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2585.8s	2585.8	 Is is this are these gas prices going to change how americans look at what car they buy because they're going to get worse time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2592.2s	2592.2	 We had that they're gonna get worse people started looking at not buying suvs. We could have seven dollar gas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2598.6s	2598.6	 Oh, I said there was a picture actually. Uh, I tweeted in california. There was a seven dollar and 11 cents gas broadly broadly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2605.2s	2605.2	 We could have seven dollar gas all throughout the country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2607.2s	2607.2	 But jay cal the um, you know remember the average automotive automobile in the u.s lasts for 12 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2613.0s	2613.0	 That's how often people change out their cars. So that's eight percent of the fleet being changed per year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2618.0s	2618.0	 Yep, and the interest rates for auto loans have spiked like crazy now with this change in the fed rates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2623.4s	2623.4	 And as a result the uh delinquency on auto loan portfolios has spiked like crazy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2629.5s	2629.5	 And so, you know, yes, sure theoretically people will think about buying an electric car
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2633.6s	2633.6	 But most people aren't thinking about that on average for five or six years from now because that's the average of a 12 year cycle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2638.8s	2638.8	 Right five five years from now wait till all these peloton bikes need to get repossessed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2642.4s	2642.4	 Well all these uh, actually the the the weight for cars and the overpricing of cars has ended in the last two months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2648.5s	2648.5	 And there are multiple cars now on the market 25 30k for a 50 plus mile per gallon gallon car
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2653.5s	2653.5	 I think this actually one of the silver linings coming out of this is people might actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2657.2s	2657.2	 Stop buying as many suvs or you know, I think our average is in the low 20s right now in europe's is in the high 40s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2663.4s	2663.4	 The problem is like, you know every other for miles per gallon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2667.0s	2667.0	 part of the government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2669.1s	2669.1	 Acknowledges that you have to really ring fence and protect consumers, right? Like if you look at the securities laws
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2676.5s	2676.5	 They're meant to protect them at all costs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2678.8s	2678.8	 And jason, you've you know, you've been frustrated by some of the rules that haven't changed and when they change they change so slowly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2685.3s	2685.3	 but the reason is because sometimes that you you want people to make good decisions and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2690.7s	2690.7	 If you uh, you know give them a bunch of firepower. They're just going to spend it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2695.6s	2695.6	 You know what we really did was we gave folks just a ton of money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2700.2s	2700.2	 And what did they do? They acted rationally they spent it. Yeah, now we have to take it all back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2706.4s	2706.4	 um, and that's that's I don't think that's going to be as easy or as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2710.7s	2710.7	 Simple as people think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2712.8s	2712.8	 What what percentage of the money supply do you think is in excess right now in the united states?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2717.0s	2717.0	 Well, look I told you this because I wrote this in my annual letter, but it's it's stunning that you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2720.9s	2720.9	 The reason the stock market went up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2722.9s	2722.9	 Dollar for dollar was actually tied to the growth in the m2 money supply the correlation was 0.92
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2729.2s	2729.2	 So for every dollar that the fed printed the stock market went up by 92 cents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2737.0s	2737.0	 So, you know it stands to reason that if the fed is going to take three to five trillion dollars of value out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2743.2s	2743.2	 Then we have to rerate the equity markets by three to five trillion dollars at a minimum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2747.2s	2747.2	 And then you have to rerate and re-baseline for earnings and so that's probably another 20 or 30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2752.3s	2752.3	 Let's go. Yeah, let's talk about the end game here. Um, the rates go up people stop buying homes people go back to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2760.5s	2760.5	 and uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2762.0s	2762.0	 Energy prices come back down because people are not buying as much of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2766.1s	2766.1	 Spending goes down and people rebalance and that takes a year the job openings could also disappear by the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2771.6s	2771.6	 I mean like they're going down 400 000 a month is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2775.1s	2775.1	 You're assuming that all of a sudden like demand is stable, but it's not necessarily stable and it demand and in a demand contraction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2782.1s	2782.1	 Yes, people get fired, but then also new job openings change, right? There's fewer of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2786.8s	2786.8	 They're they're more specific in the way that people salaries go down, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2790.8s	2790.8	 That's the salaries go down. That's the piece i'm waiting for that to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2793.8s	2793.8	 That would be I don't know if you guys have early warning signs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2796.1s	2796.1	 But the two early warning signs I have in my you know, uh, uh job of investing in early stage companies is when people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2803.4s	2803.4	 Well, what's the average salary for an engineer if that hasn't gone down by now then it's that's a lagging indicator, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2809.0s	2809.0	 Is that would be to meet capitulation salaries go down or people instead of laying people off sacks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2814.5s	2814.5	 They do uh salary cuts out of company. That is really hard to do right? That's yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2819.2s	2819.2	 I don't think they do so more liquidation preferences and deals, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2822.0s	2822.0	 I think the way the salaries come down is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2824.9s	2824.9	 Startups freeze their hiring plans or they lay people off and all of a sudden the war for talent subsides
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2829.7s	2829.7	 It's easier to hire people and so there's no need to keep raising up salaries. Are you seeing that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2834.5s	2834.5	 Yeah, I think we're seeing the beginning of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2835.9s	2835.9	 But I gotta tell you I mean, I think that startups have not fully
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2841.1s	2841.1	 Embraced or realized what's happening. I just got back from the co2 summit over the past couple of days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2847.2s	2847.2	 This was an event that was hosted by co2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2850.4s	2850.4	 You know whose founders are philippe and thomas lefont very smart guys very smart investors who've been public market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2857.6s	2857.6	 Sort of hedge fund investors for a long time, but also have a large venture fund to do growth stage investing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2863.0s	2863.0	 Some of the takeaways from that conference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2865.3s	2865.3	 Some of the more vivid lines that stuck with me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2868.7s	2868.7	 Is that one of the speakers said?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2870.8s	2870.8	 that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2871.8s	2871.8	 He said that when it comes to runway for startups three to four years is the new two years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2877.4s	2877.4	 Because if you just have two years of runway you're going to need to raise in a year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2881.6s	2881.6	 And in a year from now, we're going to be in the middle of a recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2884.8s	2884.8	 They're predicting they're forecasting that capital availability is going to decline about 75 percent the amount of money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2890.4s	2890.4	 That's venture money that's available the ecosystem down by three quarters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2894.2s	2894.2	 so if you try to raise in that environment either you're not going to be able to or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2898.8s	2898.8	 Investors are going to you know have all the leverage. You're not going to get terms that you like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2903.2s	2903.2	 So they were recommending three to four years of runway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2906.4s	2906.4	 So that is not what I think a lot of companies are just not even possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2911.6s	2911.6	 The other thing that the other really vivid takeaway is that they did some polling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2916.0s	2916.0	 Of the startup founders who are in attendance, okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2919.0s	2919.0	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2920.3s	2920.3	 What the numbers basically showed is a is a contradiction on the one hand the founders sort of understood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2926.8s	2926.8	 That intellectually that we're headed into a downturn. We're headed to a recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2930.4s	2930.4	 And so the polling reflected that on the other hand if you ask the founders how they're going to react to it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2935.5s	2935.5	 What are you going to do about it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2936.5s	2936.5	 You're going to cut a head count or you're going to accelerate your business to beat competitors. Everybody said oh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2940.8s	2940.8	 We're going to out accelerate our competitors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2942.8s	2942.8	 So everybody thought that they're the exception in other words everyone understood we're headed for this massive recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2948.3s	2948.3	 It's going to be really bad, but we're going to be the one company that doesn't need to cut
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2952.0s	2952.0	 We're actually going to grow we're going to accelerate during the downturn. So there was a real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2956.3s	2956.3	 contradiction in how founders are interpreting this advice and I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2961.2s	2961.2	 Have to tell you when I talk to founders in our own portfolio what I see is, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2965.3s	2965.3	 We've now done multiple meetings where we lay out what's happening in the economy and they get it. They understand it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2971.2s	2971.2	 And when we do a board meeting they're like, okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2973.0s	2973.0	 We're going to go look at our plan and we're going to reevaluate and we're going to make major cuts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2976.6s	2976.6	 We're going to bring our burn multiple down to you know, the where it should be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2980.8s	2980.8	 But then you know when you're checking with them a couple of months later and you're like, where are you on the plane?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2984.6s	2984.6	 I haven't taken the medicine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2985.9s	2985.9	 It's or the medicine is like a 10 cut and i'm like guys like 10 percent's a performance review. Yeah, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2992.8s	2992.8	 Doing every year anyway, yeah, you get rid of the the bottom like the c performers you promote the a's and b's and you get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=2998.2s	2998.2	 rid of the c so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3000.0s	3000.0	 No one really wants to take the medicine yet. And um, you know, it's a problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3004.0s	3004.0	 I mean sequoia has this great chart called survival of the quickest that we should put up on the screen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3009.6s	3009.6	 And it shows two lines one company is the one that takes the medicine right away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3013.6s	3013.6	 Brings their burn down to where it should be and then they're able to grow from there and they really will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3018.3s	3018.3	 Out-accelerate the competitors, but then there's the company that basically delays and waits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3023.7s	3023.7	 And what happens is by the time they finally get religion to make the cuts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3027.4s	3027.4	 It's too late because even after they make the cuts they don't have enough runway on the other side burn the capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3032.2s	3032.2	 Yeah, they burn the capital and then they're in a death spiral
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3034.7s	3034.7	 So I think you know what what companies need to think about is this is a 75 reduction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3038.9s	3038.9	 Imagine if you did a hundred million dollar round last year, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3043.2s	3043.2	 If you go try to raise next year in the mills recession that 100 million dollar round might look like a 25 million dollar round
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3050.0s	3050.0	 So imagine if you're burning an extra 25 to 50 million more than you should be according to your burn multiple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3056.4s	3056.4	 You're basically burning the next round forget about the fact that the last round gave you all this cushion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3061.5s	3061.5	 Think about how much of the next round you're burning and if you reorder your thinking around that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3066.7s	3066.7	 It could lead to a change in behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3069.3s	3069.3	 Anecdotally, i'm seeing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3071.2s	3071.2	 people come back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3073.5s	3073.5	 from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3074.7s	3074.7	 Rounds where they were expecting 40 or 50 million dollars in some cases like with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3079.3s	3079.3	 250k in revenue 500k in revenue they were living in a 200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3083.9s	3083.9	 300 times revenue kind of world it was just insane and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3089.2s	3089.2	 You know, they're now coming back with 10 million dollar caps 15 million dollar caps on their notes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3094.4s	3094.4	 I was offered 100 million dollars of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3097.1s	3097.1	 At a 50 discount and I said call me when you get to 65 and that's the best company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3102.2s	3102.2	 That's literally the best company. That's the best and the best founders to bet on right of probably most private companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3107.9s	3107.9	 It's them. You don't like that valuation. Shamath
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3110.1s	3110.1	 What is that valuation 40 at 50% off?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3113.6s	3113.6	 I it's less of a judgment on but it's just more an observation that we're at the beginning of the beginning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3119.8s	3119.8	 Again, we're at the beginning of the beginning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3122.6s	3122.6	 Okay for all of us that lived through the 2000. This was four years of sheer hell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3129.3s	3129.3	 and a grind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3131.2s	3131.2	 Now we have 30 trillion dollars that we have to work through the economy a recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3135.9s	3135.9	 We have to overcome a war we need to end and people all of a sudden assume that two or three rate hikes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3143.1s	3143.1	 And five or six months of headlines are enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3146.8s	3146.8	 And on the margin, maybe they're right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3148.8s	3148.8	 But from my perspective, you know, it's less a judgment on but it's just an observation that we're at the beginning of something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3155.3s	3155.3	 That just fundamentally has to take some amount of time to work its way through the system. And so I don't understand why anybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3162.5s	3162.5	 Would give up their liquidity in this moment right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3165.2s	3165.2	 Why would you why would I why would I give up 100 million dollars of cash in my bank again?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3169.0s	3169.0	 I would not do that right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3170.8s	3170.8	 Because the cash the caps the cash gives you so much optionality. It's basically so much optionality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3175.7s	3175.7	 So you're going to be looking for distress and this is the thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3178.5s	3178.5	 So you have a huge amount of capital leaving the ecosystem like we know tiger is basically out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3183.7s	3183.7	 I mean they were the basically the default provider of growth stage capital over the last couple of years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3188.4s	3188.4	 So you have a lot of liquidity leaving the system and then the liquidity that's in the system is waiting for distress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3194.1s	3194.1	 So you're right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3195.9s	3195.9	 There's a quarter. I mean like we talked about there's a quarter trillion dollars of quote unquote dry powder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3200.4s	3200.4	 I mean, I know chamath thinks that people are going to give that money back, but there's never been as much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3204.8s	3204.8	 There's not that much a lot of that's deployed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3207.2s	3207.2	 They're not going to give it back. I just deployed. Yeah, look at that that tiger fund tiger raised a new 12 billion dollar fund
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3213.6s	3213.6	 That was announced in march and tech crunch. We covered it on the show a month ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3217.6s	3217.6	 Yeah, the tech crunch on article saying it was already deployed in six months. So I wasn't on that show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3222.5s	3222.5	 Oh, that was the one where Jake i'll try to replace you with brad gersener
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3225.9s	3225.9	 We should we should do the show weekly going forward instead of monthly it might be better to keep up with these trends
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3230.5s	3230.5	 Okay, jake how you made a good point there. Can we just go back this for a second?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3233.7s	3233.7	 You said the founders were they're still anchored on this world of two to three hundred times ar evaluations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3239.5s	3239.5	 Let me just tell you where the new valuation levels are and this is obviously in flux
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3243.2s	3243.2	 But i'm pretty sure the valuation levels are at 20 to 30 times arr. That's for a company. That's growing three x year over year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3249.6s	3249.6	 Yeah, three x year over year. That's the best of the best the reason how you get there next year is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3254.8s	3254.8	 Arr, basically, yes exactly and and the way that you get there is that if you look at like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3259.6s	3259.6	 The um the multiples for like the best public sass companies that are like say a 40 percent grower like a snowflake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3266.0s	3266.0	 They're at 8x. Yeah, so, you know, so basically giving more credit for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3271.3s	3271.3	 The higher growth rate. Yeah, right, but they really have to have that three x growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3275.2s	3275.2	 So, you know if you're a founder think about the fact that when you try to go raise next year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3281.5s	3281.5	 Assuming you're the best of the best you'll get 20 to 30 times arr now think about your spending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3287.0s	3287.0	 Not last round's money. You're spending the next round's money if you could just reorient your thinking that way you'd burn a lot less money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3294.3s	3294.3	 Yeah, the the I literally had a deal, you know in the 30 and 40 range and angel investors who never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3301.9s	3301.9	 early stage angel investors seed funds that did not look at multiples are now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3308.3s	3308.3	 Asking me because when I send a deal memo to 10 000 people for my syndicate people hit reply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3313.8s	3313.8	 People are hitting reply now and saying I did the math on this. This is the multiple. This is this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3317.9s	3317.9	 This is the berm multiple. They're actually doing the math
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3320.6s	3320.6	 So we all of a sudden have discipline that I have not seen in this investor class
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3325.9s	3325.9	 In the 10 years i've been doing it. So that is to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3329.5s	3329.5	 One of the great silver linings here. I think people are going to do a better job with their personal balance sheets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3334.6s	3334.6	 They're going to invest less in speculative stuff and they're going to invest more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3338.3s	3338.3	 In the actual builders who have discipline so we're going to see this massive swing to discipline
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3344.4s	3344.4	 And we're going to flush out all the people who don't have product market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3348.0s	3348.0	 Think about all those folks like what's happened in the last six months. It's like they've been long unprofitable tech

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3397.0s	3397.0	 And if you look at the craziness since the last all-in episode, you know this 3ac three-hour capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3402.9s	3402.9	 They're a crypto hedge fund that was letting people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3406.0s	3406.0	 Basically loan out their crypto

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3410.0s	3410.0	 Are basically closing a 10 billion dollar

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3419.1s	3419.1	 The founders and employees of that company are not being allowed to leave south korea doesn't mean they're guilty, but it's certainly not looking good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3427.6s	3427.6	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3428.8s	3428.8	 There is a whole situation with solana and a company built on top of it. So lend which is not solana
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3434.8s	3434.8	 It's an application built on top of it. I talked to vinny lingham our friend earlier this week about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3439.3s	3439.3	 They had a whale who had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3441.8s	3441.8	 Tried to loan out a hundred million and they had to freeze their account because they thought the downward pressure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3447.3s	3447.3	 Since there's not many buyers in crypto right now could collapse solana. So thoughts on crypto writ large. What is this going to look like sax?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3455.9s	3455.9	 Over the next year for the dot-com crash all over again. I mean basically you had an extremely promising technology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3462.3s	3462.3	 I mean it is a promising technology. Of course, it is a future, you know technology platform, but the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3468.5s	3468.5	 Price action got totally decoupled from the level of progress in the space and people were not valuing these things based on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3476.3s	3476.3	 Real customers real usage and real use cases, but it was became, you know, very speculative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3480.8s	3480.8	 And again all this was fueled by the excess liquidity that was pumped into the system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3485.6s	3485.6	 So, you know, we've said it before that crypto is like a liquidity sponge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3489.5s	3489.5	 It sucks up when there's a lot of excess liquidity. It sucks up that liquidity, but now that sponge is getting wrung out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3495.6s	3495.6	 And um, you know part of the problem is with interest rates going up, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3499.0s	3499.0	 It's one thing when you have negative real interest rates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3502.2s	3502.2	 And and and you can't earn a return on your money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3505.3s	3505.3	 Then you start to get you basically people start to push the envelope and invest in more more speculative things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3510.7s	3510.7	 But as you can get a real return in like let's say there's like a real risk-free rate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3516.9s	3516.9	 Now there's alternatives for all that cash and then you got the problem of leverage as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3520.6s	3520.6	 Which I think over the last few weeks the crypto space was heavily over levered and a lot of people got margin called and wiped out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3527.2s	3527.2	 That's the contagion that's occurred and people were levered up five ten times their bitcoin on these roads
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3533.0s	3533.0	 These token sale things get litigated. I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3536.3s	3536.3	 the amount of the amount of grift by so many of these venture firms in running these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3542.8s	3542.8	 Sketchy deals where they would put in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3545.4s	3545.4	 Some amount of money. This is my understanding of the scam because it was explained to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3549.2s	3549.2	 You put in a little bit of equity at some crazy price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3552.4s	3552.4	 And then you get these tokens and apparently there's no like you can just sell these tokens day one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3556.9s	3556.9	 and so what happens is like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3558.6s	3558.6	 You you price the equity but it's meaningless because really what you're getting is the right to get some amount of these tokens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3564.9s	3564.9	 The price is crazy. You sell it and then you just kind of walk away and apparently, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3569.4s	3569.4	 You do these deals where you just rinse and repeat this thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3572.6s	3572.6	 Um, well wait to wait till that gets exposed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3575.2s	3575.2	 I mean that seems like a firm the firm that did this the most is and reese and horowitz
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3580.0s	3580.0	 Uh chris dixon, I think was considered like the best investor last year or the year before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3585.5s	3585.5	 Uh because of all these token returns. I I gotta wonder when they go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3590.4s	3590.4	 now that this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3591.9s	3591.9	 People are losing money. That's when people start suing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3594.9s	3594.9	 I mean, what is it going to look like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3597.1s	3597.1	 If they were what what do you think their marks looked like last year versus right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3602.2s	3602.2	 I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3603.2s	3603.2	 And all these coins like looking back in the review mirror and saying hey you bought all these coins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3608.1s	3608.1	 You flip some number of coins. I mean to your point your mouth like what is the litigation path and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3614.8s	3614.8	 The shadow economy that was created. What is there's an article?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3618.2s	3618.2	 There's an article and I think it was in bloomberg. Um about folks trying to figure out how to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3623.6s	3623.6	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3625.4s	3625.4	 A lawsuit filed against binance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3628.2s	3628.2	 And the problem was that they didn't even know what entity to sue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3632.4s	3632.4	 Um, it's not clear who owns what and you know, what owns the other and who the ultimate look-through ownership structure is and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3640.4s	3640.4	 Um, and it doesn't mean that binance is guilty of anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3643.1s	3643.1	 But the article was just you know showing how there was a u.s investor who lost 1.2 million dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3647.9s	3647.9	 Who wanted to file a lawsuit and they have every right to do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3651.2s	3651.2	 Um couldn't even find the corporate entity to to actually file this lawsuit against
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3656.3s	3656.3	 So if that's what's happening in a trillion dollar market, there's um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3661.0s	3661.0	 It's gonna be a lot of pain free. It's it's a lot of oversight. That's that's that free free bird
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3665.6s	3665.6	 What is this going to do to regulation and crypto at this point?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3668.0s	3668.0	 Because crypto regulators now are going to or regulators are going to just be looking at this going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3672.0s	3672.0	 Wow, look at all the pain and suffering and when a local
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3675.8s	3675.8	 da
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3677.9s	3677.9	 Gets, you know five or six of their people complaining they lost money in taraluna or whatever it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3683.1s	3683.1	 This is like the perfect opportunity for them to collect a pelt and get some crypto kid and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3688.0s	3688.0	 You know hold them responsible and get some great headlines. I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3691.5s	3691.5	 What do you what do you think happens from this point forward in the crypto land?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3695.2s	3695.2	 What you just said?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3696.6s	3696.6	 Okay, there you have it folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3698.6s	3698.6	 But what about regulation? I guess that's the next piece because all these entities have taken a very the sec last july or august publish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3706.2s	3706.2	 This kind of initial opinion letter, but remember there's also the cftc. There's a bunch of regulatory authorities in the united states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3713.5s	3713.5	 That have a longer process than governments ex us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3716.9s	3716.9	 That have had a much more kind of stringent point of view that there's a lot of casino like gambling going on with these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3722.2s	3722.2	 And that's it. There's no functional utility. There's not it's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3725.6s	3725.6	 Is it a security if there's no underlying business if it's not a security then it's just a bet on something if it's a bet on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3730.4s	3730.4	 Something it's gambling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3732.0s	3732.0	 It's you know, obvious that if it's a security it has to be governed by the sec
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3737.5s	3737.5	 If it's a future or commodity, it's the cftc and the problem is we need congress to pass some legislative framework
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3745.1s	3745.1	 That puts the puck in one side of the of the arena a rink or the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3749.3s	3749.3	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3750.1s	3750.1	 And otherwise otherwise all this gray is going to exist for a long time and people you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3756.2s	3756.2	 If if governments really hate it when retail investors lose money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3760.0s	3760.0	 Well watch out because they just had two trillion dollars in the u.s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3763.5s	3763.5	 We have a lot of other regulators that can prosecute cases like the dfs in new york
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3768.8s	3768.8	 Uh, this is the department of financial services. They are a pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3773.5s	3773.5	 Litigious prosecutorial group. I mean they go after scams and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3778.0s	3778.0	 People preying on consumers and retail investors in a very aggressive way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3782.4s	3782.4	 Often outside of the purview of the scc. They often coordinate with the doj or the scc in evaluating enforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3789.6s	3789.6	 decisions, but they will prosecute and uh, and I think that there's a um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3795.4s	3795.4	 You know as you said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3797.1s	3797.1	 A lot of opportunity when people have been grifted out of their money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3801.5s	3801.5	 Uh for politically motivated and you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3805.2s	3805.2	 People that generally have kind of the right point of view that are in a position to prosecute to go after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3810.0s	3810.0	 Uh the offenders so you're right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3812.0s	3812.0	 There will be there will be a lot of action on this over the next couple of years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3815.5s	3815.5	 And then chamath is right the way it gets resolved is a congressional act
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3819.2s	3819.2	 But by the way, i'll just point out in the year 2000 congress passed what was called the commodity futures modernization act
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3825.8s	3825.8	 And that cfma was really meant to kind of quote bring commodities and futures into the digital age and they started working on it in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3832.3s	3832.3	 1996 it took four years to get it done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3834.5s	3834.5	 Within four years it was already out of date and a lot of what was going on with respect to how exchanges operate and the types of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3841.0s	3841.0	 Contracts are being created
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3843.0s	3843.0	 It was already missed. So, you know, the problem we have here is that by legislating the state of the market today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3849.3s	3849.3	 Um without creating enough flexibility in how enforcement action can be pursued and how things can be interpreted in the future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3855.2s	3855.2	 You could end up in a similar situation where people just find and run around and the whole thing repeats itself in the next few years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3860.4s	3860.4	 Because guess what people will always want to gamble and grifters will always want to grift
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3865.2s	3865.2	 And so there will always be a way to try and scan people out of their money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3868.5s	3868.5	 Yeah, and that's just sky datons poker game. Hey, oh hey

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3900.2s	3900.2	 Oh, they just bought a trading card ahead of everybody else. Who cares? Well, you know who cares?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3905.3s	3905.3	 Turns out the southern district of new york cares and they are a pretty serious group of people

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3912.7s	3912.7	 Uh open sea was charged in the first several digital asset insider trading scheme. So just because insider trading
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3920.9s	3920.9	 Didn't exist as a concept for nfts before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3924.3s	3924.3	 Congratulations doesn't exist in crypto. I mean if they want to really find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3928.9s	3928.9	 Uh the honeypots here. I mean, it's the worst kept secret in crypto how much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3934.5s	3934.5	 Insider trading is going on amongst the organizations that run the exchanges and their side pockets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3941.6s	3941.6	 That they use to to manage liquidity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3943.8s	3943.8	 I mean this is the it's the biggest thing that's been happening in crypto
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3948.0s	3948.0	 If you're wondering why people were spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a board ape or whatever like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3953.6s	3953.6	 There might have been some shenanigans going on here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3956.4s	3956.4	 And I mean, no, but i Jason it's not it's not illegal. This is my understanding though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3960.0s	3960.0	 It's not illegal to front run crypto trade. So most of these organizations that that run an exchange
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3965.9s	3965.9	 Right compete for order flow and they're able to just look at that order flow and then they front run the trade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3971.4s	3971.4	 And they're on the other side of that. So they're always making money. And so they were making
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3975.6s	3975.6	 Tens of billions of dollars all these exchanges were yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3979.2s	3979.2	 And then I guess the question becomes sax, you know in terms of since you're an attorney like how you interpret this stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3986.0s	3986.0	 It there may not be a law in the books about front-running nfts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3989.0s	3989.0	 But there are laws on the books about fraud and nft and conspiracy to you know, um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3994.9s	3994.9	 Grift people out of their money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=3996.3s	3996.3	 So this is all going to come crashing down and the discovery is going to be next if the southern district of new york
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4002.0s	4002.0	 Actually subpoenaed any of these exchanges all hell would break loose. Oh, no, they are you can be sure that's in process
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4007.3s	4007.3	 If they go after one nft flipper, no, no, forget nfts. I'm saying coins crypto
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4013.0s	4013.0	 Like that's the huge market and they will they're turning over these cards because you know how they like to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4018.1s	4018.1	 They like to flip their way up to the top person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4021.2s	4021.2	 But we're not talking about january 6th here. We're talking about gas in the ukraine next. Hey, oh, hey, ho
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4027.4s	4027.4	 Uh, that's a little reference for you. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4030.0s	4030.0	 Listen now that we're now that we're now we're in ten and we've we've kind of like broken the ice and we're friends
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4035.2s	4035.2	 I feel good. I feel like you want to be playing as a team again. You you want to redo our intros?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4039.5s	4039.5	 So you're not being such a bitch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4042.1s	4042.1	 Oh, I don't care. I don't care. I don't think we just move forward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4046.4s	4046.4	 I think we all understand. I thought I like to be recognized. You said you said that you were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4050.5s	4050.5	 Workshopping an intro. So do you want to do your intros at the end of this or not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4054.1s	4054.1	 I'm not doing the intros. No, i'm gonna strike on interest. No, I didn't they were they were here's the thing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4062.4s	4062.4	 That was a joke. I I wanted to do intros. I didn't know coming into this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4067.6s	4067.6	 How sensitive people would be and then sax is like

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4074.2s	4074.2	 Nda and i'm scared about the things I said so spike content needs to be I actually took that out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4079.4s	4079.4	 You were the spike content guy. You're the most concerned about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4082.9s	4082.9	 We know we have an agreement around that is a good rule non-disparagement. He didn't want to have in there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4088.0s	4088.0	 I ended oh he didn't want non-disparagement. I took it out to disparage you day and night
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4092.0s	4092.0	 I mean to be honest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4093.0s	4093.0	 I took it out because I thought you would be more sensitive about accusing others of disparaging you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4098.3s	4098.3	 I this whole show is you disparaging me. Do you have an intro or not for I don't have interest prepared
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4104.0s	4104.0	 No, i'll do interest next episode. I promise everybody I wanted to take the temperature of my besties
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4108.4s	4108.4	 I don't know if people are sensitive right now. You want me to make a joke about brad gershner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4112.1s	4112.1	 We got real shit to talk about can we talk about ukraine and world war three?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4115.5s	4115.5	 It's not all about our narcissistic nonsense as for david over teenage boys running amok
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4121.7s	4121.7	 Go ahead something happened in the last week that I think is pretty disconcerting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4125.3s	4125.3	 I mean just intellectually speaking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4126.7s	4126.7	 We all know that wars that go on and on have a tendency to escalate and there was an example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4132.1s	4132.1	 Of how this could happen over the past week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4134.7s	4134.7	 lithuania
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4136.1s	4136.1	 is now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4137.6s	4137.6	 essentially stopping the flow of goods from the russian mainland to another part of russia called cleningrad which is it's called an oblast it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4146.7s	4146.7	 Little area, but it's outside the russian mainland. It's basically between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4150.4s	4150.4	 poland and lithuania
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4152.3s	4152.3	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4153.2s	4153.2	 So goods go by rail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4155.5s	4155.5	 From the russian mainland to cleningrad and they've been stopping these goods because they say they're under eu sanction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4162.4s	4162.4	 the problem is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4164.0s	4164.0	 Listen when you think about a sanction a sanction is me not buying goods from you because I don't like what you're doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4170.6s	4170.6	 That's fair game. Everyone has a choice over who they want to buy from but this is not that this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4176.4s	4176.4	 uh lithuania deciding to stop goods going from russia to russia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4181.3s	4181.3	 And so the russians say this is a blockade I think with some justification and blockades are understood to be an act of war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4188.6s	4188.6	 So you've got lithuania
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4190.7s	4190.7	 Basically engaging in this act of escalation against russia. We always thought it would be poland, but it's right exactly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4197.6s	4197.6	 And remember lithuania is a member of nato's they have an article five guarantee now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4203.0s	4203.0	 Think about the upside versus downside of this action
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4206.8s	4206.8	 In terms of from the western point of view the upside is this has absolutely no impact on the outcome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4212.8s	4212.8	 Of the war this is not going to help anyone in ukraine to blockade cleningrad and prevent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4218.7s	4218.7	 Coal and building materials and steel from reaching cleningrad. That's not going to have any impact on the war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4224.2s	4224.2	 So there's zero upside to this from a military standpoint, but the downside is that you now have lithuania and russia getting into it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4233.2s	4233.2	 And if they get into a war then we are instantly pulled in under article five or in middle war three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4240.0s	4240.0	 So this is the kind of dangerous escalatory act that has no upside only downside for us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4245.6s	4245.6	 And my view on it is that we have to tell we have to instruct frankly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4250.2s	4250.2	 Our treaty allies not to engage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4253.4s	4253.4	 In these types of dangerous acts because there's a huge externality we can be pulled in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4257.8s	4257.8	 This is very dangerous and I just wonder if the administration is on top of this did they give the green light
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4264.9s	4264.9	 To the lithuanians to do this or were they caught by surprise and what is the reaction to acts like this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4270.6s	4270.6	 Uh, you know what I worry is that we're conducting foreign policy by virtue signaling where we just say who are the good guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4276.0s	4276.0	 And who are the bad guys?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4277.7s	4277.7	 And you know if the russians are the bad guys lithuanians are the good guys. So therefore this is okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4283.2s	4283.2	 It's like playing cops and robbers on a global stage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4285.7s	4285.7	 I think we need to be asking the question. Is this smart or is it dumb?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4289.7s	4289.7	 Is this prudential or is it reckless? Is this in our interest or is it not in our interest?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4295.9s	4295.9	 and um, you know, I really got to wonder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4299.2s	4299.2	 About who's mining the store on this day 120. Um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4303.9s	4303.9	 And it feels like this is just doesn't have an ended site. Is there an ended site here? What's the end?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4308.9s	4308.9	 I mean the the end is a negotiation. What do the two parties want?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4312.2s	4312.2	 Yeah, what do the two parties want at this point?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4314.0s	4314.0	 I mean the people in russia are suffering during this the people in ukraine are being murdered
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4319.6s	4319.6	 In ukraine are being murdered. I mean, how does it end at the problem is that biden?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4324.3s	4324.3	 Engaged the united states in a proxy war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4327.2s	4327.2	 Without our real explicit discussion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4330.0s	4330.0	 Number one and then number two is then we pulled and we pressured europe to really draw a hard line
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4337.0s	4337.0	 but then now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4338.4s	4338.4	 are kind of working around it so that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4341.7s	4341.7	 Countries that suffer the most are europe now. I think you're starting to see the tea leaves though last week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4347.6s	4347.6	 There was a group of european leaders. I think it was macron
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4352.0s	4352.0	 dragui
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4353.2s	4353.2	 uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4354.3s	4354.3	 And I can't remember if it was the german chancellor or not and one other person who went
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4358.8s	4358.8	 um to ukraine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4360.4s	4360.4	 And if I had to bet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4362.8s	4362.8	 I think the message was kind of like all right. Listen like we need to find an organized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4367.8s	4367.8	 detente here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4369.8s	4369.8	 Because there is you know, according to europe a leman like situation in terms of economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4376.4s	4376.4	 Contagion that could manifest over the next months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4380.3s	4380.3	 so I think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4382.4s	4382.4	 The end game is probably some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4385.6s	4385.6	 organized negotiated detente and ceasefire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4389.4s	4389.4	 um, I don't think anybody will be happy with it, but I think by and large russia is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4394.8s	4394.8	 And has won, you know meaning they've won economically they're selling oil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4399.8s	4399.8	 Like it's not you know, like it's going out of style. It's just not selling it to europe and to america
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4405.1s	4405.1	 Um, you know, they're selling it to china. They're selling it to africa. They're selling india is fine with it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4409.6s	4409.6	 They'll they'll take some well also tramath. They've won. They're winning on the battlefield. There was an article in the washington post
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4415.1s	4415.1	 There was an article in the washington post in the last week or so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4418.0s	4418.0	 And the washington post is basically the house organ of the washington establishment and the blob
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4423.5s	4423.5	 Basically saying that hopes are dimming for ukraine on the battlefield the russians have now won 20 to 25 percent of the country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4430.6s	4430.6	 They've won that eastern that donbass region. They've done it with the help
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4435.1s	4435.1	 Of russian separatists in ukraine and the amazing thing in this article was that they were saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4440.8s	4440.8	 That the ukrainians were days away from running out of ammunition despite the 40 billion that we just appropriated to them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4446.3s	4446.3	 Where did that money go and the and conversely they're saying russia is having just unbelievable casualties and they're running out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4452.8s	4452.8	 Weapons and they are obviously out of keev now, uh, and they're in the donbass mostly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4457.9s	4457.9	 So I don't think the rest is running out of anything the russians the the the russians. So listen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4462.9s	4462.9	 I I said on this pod well, they said they're out of tanks, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4466.4s	4466.4	 And then the troops are well, they've adjusted their strategy and they've they're they're they're learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4470.9s	4470.9	 They're adapting to this new kind of warfare this asymmetric warfare where you can take out a tank with a drone, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4477.6s	4477.6	 But but look, you know remember on this pod three weeks into the war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4480.9s	4480.9	 Everybody who was in favor of this proxy war was saying how great it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4485.1s	4485.1	 And they were saying it was going to lead to a new birth of freedom in the west that it was strengthening our alliances
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4490.2s	4490.2	 You had francis fukuyama predicting that we were going to win the war and it would lead to this rebirth of freedom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4496.0s	4496.0	 In the west we should have known at that moment everything that fukuyama
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4499.6s	4499.6	 Basically predicts the opposite always wrong. He's always always wrong. It's like negative one correlation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4504.8s	4504.8	 Yeah, and remember I said three weeks in that we were potentially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4508.1s	4508.1	 I think putin made the mistake in the first three weeks of thinking this would be a cakewalk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4511.2s	4511.2	 But that we were making the mistake of thinking the next phase would be a cakewalk and sure enough here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4515.8s	4515.8	 We are russia has now won the eastern part of the country just to build on what you said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4520.8s	4520.8	 You know we engage in economic sanctions and I was the first one to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4524.8s	4524.8	 Hey, this could really work and this could be a roadmap for how to do it and it turned out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4528.5s	4528.5	 This is the roadmap for how not to do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4530.7s	4530.7	 You can't on the front door say here are these sanctions and then walk around the back door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4535.1s	4535.1	 And basically open the door for them these these sanctions were so porous as to be like swiss cheese
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4540.8s	4540.8	 We focused on virtue signaling acts like confiscating a plane or a boat or a house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4547.1s	4547.1	 But we didn't focus on the structural things we needed to actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4551.3s	4551.3	 You know make the mandate that we believe to be just to come to life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4555.0s	4555.0	 And so russia's completely worked around it their economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4558.9s	4558.9	 Effectively, you know is thriving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4562.5s	4562.5	 So what have we gained how is it thriving? I mean, I don't know that thriving is how they would describe their economy right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4568.0s	4568.0	 Yeah, I mentioned they're printing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4571.0s	4571.0	 Record rubles are five-year-high jason. They're selling gas. They're selling phosphate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4575.6s	4575.6	 They're actually making a market and the prices have doubled and tripled in those commodities because the flow has been restricted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4581.8s	4581.8	 So because the exact opposite of what we tried to do by the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4584.9s	4584.9	 I'll point out something that I pointed out in february which was the biggest concern for me at the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4589.8s	4589.8	 When we stopped allowing trading in the securities of russian companies we yanked away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4595.5s	4595.5	 400 billion dollars of market cap that was held primarily by pension funds and retirement funds in the us and europe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4603.1s	4603.1	 And gave that value to russia for free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4606.2s	4606.2	 We basically said here you go here all these securities. We're no longer allowed to trade in them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4610.8s	4610.8	 So guess what you guys can trade in them you can have them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4614.0s	4614.0	 They got all of their gas and energy and nickel and mining companies for free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4618.9s	4618.9	 I think it's such a good point dollars for these companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4622.1s	4622.1	 It's unbelievable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4623.3s	4623.3	 We ripped the stock out of retirement funds and we gave it to the russians and said here you go putin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4628.8s	4628.8	 Take all of these securities for free enjoy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4631.4s	4631.4	 Oh and by the way because of our idiotic sanctions and the way we're employing them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4635.2s	4635.2	 The commodity prices are going to double and triple and all these companies are going to have record profits this year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4639.1s	4639.1	 Happy fucking birthday the rubles up 5x. It's not a 5x. But yeah, okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4643.2s	4643.2	 It's a great point because if putin had retaliated against the west by nationalizing 400 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4649.0s	4649.0	 Of western assets in russia everyone would have been up in arms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4652.3s	4652.3	 But he didn't have to do that because we just gave him we gave it 400 billion totally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4656.5s	4656.5	 I mean, how did this policy make sense? It's this policy of conducting again. You cannot trade in russian securities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4662.0s	4662.0	 I'm i'm freaking blackrock. I own a billion dollars of russian securities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4666.0s	4666.0	 The u.s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4666.4s	4666.4	 Government just took it out of my portfolio that my clients owned stakes in and gave it to the russians for free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4672.4s	4672.4	 They're gone poof
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4674.7s	4674.7	 Crazy, I think listen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4676.2s	4676.2	 I think we've got like a a two level problem on this ukraine war one is that our policy hasn't made sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4681.3s	4681.3	 We should have been using diplomacy last year to avoid it. That's we had all these false hopes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4686.0s	4686.0	 Around strengthening the west and the western alliance by allowing this war to happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4690.1s	4690.1	 We then instead of trying to shut it down through a negotiated settlement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4693.7s	4693.7	 We try to use as a proxy war to weaken putin instead. It's done the opposite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4698.3s	4698.3	 So there's a whole series of policy failures here, but there's another deeper level to the failure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4703.2s	4703.2	 Which is the personnel who are implementing these policies the washington establishment the blob
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4708.8s	4708.8	 Who've been of both parties the the sort of uni party who've been implementing these policies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4715.0s	4715.0	 There has been no dissent within the washington establishment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4718.3s	4718.3	 The only guy who really spoke up in a decisive way was john meersheimer the professor of international relations from university chicago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4726.3s	4726.3	 And he was treated as a pariah by the blob in the washington establishment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4730.1s	4730.1	 Everything he predicted has come true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4732.1s	4732.1	 Yeah, he predicted this years ago years ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4734.0s	4734.0	 He predicted the u.s was leading ukraine down the primrose path and the result was that ukraine was going to get wrecked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4739.7s	4739.7	 And so it has can I just read the first paragraph of this bloomberg article that I just posted russia's current account surplus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4747.1s	4747.1	 more than tripled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4748.7s	4748.7	 In the first four months of the year to 95.8 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4753.0s	4753.0	 The central bank said as prices surge for oil and gas imports and imports plunged under the weight of sanctions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4758.7s	4758.7	 Well, you know if you're putin and you're looking at this you're like, wow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4761.4s	4761.4	 Maybe I should be under sanctions more often totally, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4764.8s	4764.8	 What country should I invade next because this is sanctions all that sanctions were was a restriction on the free market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4770.6s	4770.6	 And when you restricted the free market, you basically created a spike in price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4774.5s	4774.5	 But the market his market could still operate with a narrower set of trading partners
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4778.1s	4778.1	 He is selling energy to certain trading partners. He's selling phosphates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4781.8s	4781.8	 He's making money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4783.0s	4783.0	 They are exporting product and they're making more because certain people can't buy and they've got to go drive the price up elsewhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4788.4s	4788.4	 So not not only did our sanctions package not work and not only is the treasury treasury treasury
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4794.3s	4794.3	 Sorry flailing around now trying to find even more back doors. We actually opened a very dangerous precedent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4800.7s	4800.7	 Which is now we allowed oil to settle in currencies that are not just the united states dollar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4807.5s	4807.5	 And now russia and china are trading and settling in cny
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4810.8s	4810.8	 That's not good for us. This is not how you preserve the integrity of the reserve currency of america
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4815.7s	4815.7	 I I don't understand the eu of cutting all of their energy and then becoming dependent on russia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4821.8s	4821.8	 Then creating a ban and sanctions, but then they made a carve out that oil delivered by pipeline
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4827.8s	4827.8	 Janet yellen has been negotiating this carve out. We have been enabling russia to sell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4833.0s	4833.0	 We know the eu passed this legislation jason look look in the wall street journal today the article is there reading the cnbc right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4839.1s	4839.1	 About it like the eu passed this landmark sanctions package in may but they also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4843.8s	4843.8	 Allowed the stuff that's coming by pipeline for some reason to be a carve out if the eu wants to contain putin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4850.6s	4850.6	 From invading countries on their doorstep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4853.5s	4853.5	 They got to actually become energy independent. That's the the beginning and end of this not popular
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4858.5s	4858.5	 And this is the problem with populism. It's not popular
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4861.5s	4861.5	 It's not popular to continue to have to to have energy independent nuclear was not popular
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4867.2s	4867.2	 And so the politicians the legislators responded in a short-sighted way to the popular opinion of the day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4873.4s	4873.4	 And this is the challenge absolutely. Yeah, huge mistake on germans part
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4876.9s	4876.9	 They closed three nuclear reactors the popular sentiment in europe got highly affected by these environmental groups. Exactly. That's my point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4883.0s	4883.0	 But in the u.s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4884.6s	4884.6	 I think the people of the country want us to be energy independent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4887.7s	4887.7	 And and it's elite opinion that bought into these foolish ideas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4893.2s	4893.2	 That basically we should cancel energy independence. We should cancel the keystone pipeline job number one cancel new drilling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4899.0s	4899.0	 America should be a net energy exporter 100 job. Number one is to be energy independent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4904.9s	4904.9	 And job number two is to move to but look at biden now. I'm not there's another piece to this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4909.8s	4909.8	 You got to do this in sequence. Yeah, so when he came in he said that he was going to make the saudis a pariah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4916.7s	4916.7	 On the world stage remember this now he's going hat in hand to them to try and get them to produce more lower the price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4923.1s	4923.1	 So what was the point of this foreign policy? It was contradictory. He cancels their energy independence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4928.8s	4928.8	 He basically insults the salt the saudis on which were even more dependent for oil and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4934.9s	4934.9	 He basically refuses to engage in diplomacy on ukraine. These policies are contradictory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4939.6s	4939.6	 Even if your goal was to basically isolate the russians you would then want to improve our relationship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4945.5s	4945.5	 100 with saudi and you'd want to produce more of our own oil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4948.8s	4948.8	 100. Yeah, you you he overplayed his hand for sure. I mean you can't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4954.5s	4954.5	 not have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4955.7s	4955.7	 uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4956.5s	4956.5	 Heat in the winter in germany and the germans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4959.4s	4959.4	 Got complete that's coming by the way that's coming. You think things are bad right now wait until winter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4964.4s	4964.4	 And then and that's only going to increase putin's leverage and that's when you're going to see a real fracture in the western alliance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4969.2s	4969.2	 This idea that ukraine strengthened the western alliance. I think you will start to see the fractures could go this winter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4975.1s	4975.1	 National i mean germany's got to put those nukes back on the slow march of nationalism will continue and this will be another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4980.6s	4980.6	 Catalyzing event turn your nukes back on and and and and I also think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4984.8s	4984.8	 You know in thinking about the western alliance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4986.2s	4986.2	 I think that you know countries like germany and france are really going to question u.s leadership when they have basically a huge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4993.1s	4993.1	 Economic recession and they're wondering how they're going to heat their homes in the winter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4996.9s	4996.9	 But I think in the u.s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=4998.1s	4998.1	 Is time to reevaluate some of the alliances that we've gotten ourselves in again with this lithuania situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5004.2s	5004.2	 Do you really think that lithuania would be basically poking that big russian bear?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5010.0s	5010.0	 If they didn't have the u.s standing behind them as a bodyguard no way they would be much more circumspect and prudential and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5016.4s	5016.4	 And the fact the matter is that these eastern european countries the baltic countries and poland they have enmities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5023.0s	5023.0	 They have friction with russia going back hundreds of years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5026.4s	5026.4	 and these guys basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5029.8s	5029.8	 They have very provocative attitudes towards russia and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5033.5s	5033.5	 Our alliance with them can draw us in so we have to really keep a close lid on that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5040.0s	5040.0	 We do not want them making moves on their own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5043.9s	5043.9	 Because we could get drawn into a world war here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5046.9s	5046.9	 Yeah, and by the way to your point sax also, you know, there continues to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5053.0s	5053.0	 Escalating issues with debt and concerns about debt repayment across the eu
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5058.2s	5058.2	 And while germany is you know looking to the u.s for support and worried about energy prices
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5063.4s	5063.4	 They're going to end up having to foot the bill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5065.7s	5065.7	 to support a bunch of these eu
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5068.7s	5068.7	 Member nations that are facing debt crises and will continue to face significant debt crises over the years ahead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5074.0s	5074.0	 I mean greece made a payment recently, but greece's debt to gdp is still over 200 percent

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5090.0s	5090.0	 The spread on italian debt has spiked over the last couple weeks spiked bridgewater basically is biggest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5095.8s	5095.8	 Germany's got another freaking crisis to fight now and I think you're right. The the western alliance is more than just uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5102.1s	5102.1	 Military at this point. There's this you know, do I really want to be the economic savior over and over again?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5136.0s	5136.0	 in building energy independence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5138.4s	5138.4	 we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5139.4s	5139.4	 think about like a gas tax holiday, but as like kind of like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5143.2s	5143.2	 You know something that still needs an act of congress to pass even though congress has said they have absolutely no intention of passing it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5150.3s	5150.3	 Meanwhile, we keep losing our footing to china just today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5155.2s	5155.2	 Catl which is one of the largest battery manufacturers announced a pretty meaningful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5160.6s	5160.6	 Improvement in their you know, 3.0 battery design. These guys are now building batteries that can go a thousand kilometers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5167.2s	5167.2	 um in both of the major, you know, um

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5194.0s	5194.0	 It's really it's a really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5196.2s	5196.2	 Bad state of affairs we are we are in a very odd period in terms of government effectiveness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5202.0s	5202.0	 If you think about china's foreign policy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5204.4s	5204.4	 How have they lost out by not being part of all these conflicts? How have they lost out?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5210.4s	5210.4	 They're buying prices of oil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5213.6s	5213.6	 That were nine months ago to 18 months ago. And so there not only has russia's output price been capped
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5220.4s	5220.4	 But that's okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5221.6s	5221.6	 China's input cost has been capped and so they don't suffer the same rate of inflation that the rest of us do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5228.4s	5228.4	 So to your point david, you know our quote-unquote, you know exclusionary sanctions were ineffective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5234.8s	5234.8	 They were porous and we allowed our largest competitive frenemy if you will to basically be able to you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5241.6s	5241.6	 Drive their entire economy at 30 to 40 percent of the uh a discount to what we have to pay to do the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5249.1s	5249.1	 Right when when when china goes abroad they go abroad in search of economic resources and economic development
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5254.8s	5254.8	 That's the point of belton road
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5256.9s	5256.9	 They don't insert themselves in these middle of these conflicts that they don't understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5261.8s	5261.8	 They were never involved in the middle east. They were never involved in like policing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5266.1s	5266.1	 You know all these different countries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5268.0s	5268.0	 That has cost us a fortune
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5270.0s	5270.0	 And now the bill is finally coming due in the form of this inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5273.4s	5273.4	 We are going to have some form or another of austerity in this country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5276.8s	5276.8	 And it's partly because of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5279.3s	5279.3	 Highly militarized foreign policy in which we have sent ourselves abroad to be the world's policemen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5284.1s	5284.1	 We can no longer afford to do that. Can I make a generalization sax you react and tell me if this is true or not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5290.3s	5290.3	 If you have a country that has existed in some way shape or form, you know, the the borders could be blurry but roughly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5297.1s	5297.1	 For hundreds and hundreds of years and in some cases thousands of years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5301.6s	5301.6	 where internally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5304.2s	5304.2	 The population of that country views themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5308.3s	5308.3	 You know in a great way they they don't feel like their country is a meaningless nothing country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5314.1s	5314.1	 any attempt to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5316.7s	5316.7	 economically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5318.2s	5318.2	 humiliate such a country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5320.3s	5320.3	 tends to have failed in the past and will continue to fail and there tends to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5326.6s	5326.6	 Other countries who view it as one of these things where well if them then why not us and then they sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5332.9s	5332.9	 You know in a in a backhanded way support everybody so we end up in this odd situation where we are picking fights. We cannot win
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5340.4s	5340.4	 Totally and and the consequences for us are economically really damaging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5345.3s	5345.3	 Right, and the consequences for everybody else to stay on the sidelines is like economic prosperity. That doesn't make any sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5353.4s	5353.4	 Right unless you're in Europe and you're afraid that Russia is going to roll over more countries and that you have this existential risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5361.0s	5361.0	 That this dictator is going to attack more countries. So if you're living in eastern europe, you might have a different view of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5367.2s	5367.2	 You know, you might very much accept and want some help from you know, nato and other folks who but you're not getting that help
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5373.2s	5373.2	 That's the problem with that. That's the sad part about all I mean if it's poorly executed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5376.7s	5376.7	 It's not working at this point in time. Yeah, I mean it's a valid criticism if you look at the eu
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5381.9s	5381.9	 Okay as an entity they have almost the same gdp and output as the u.s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5387.3s	5387.3	 And if you compare them to Russia their economy their their gdp is 10 times greater than Russia. They are rich
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5393.1s	5393.1	 They can afford to allocate a few percent of their gdp of their government budget to defense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5399.7s	5399.7	 They should be able to defend themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5400.8s	5400.8	 They really should and so this idea that we have to go over to europe and bankrupt ourselves to defend rich europeans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5408.9s	5408.9	 They should be picking up 100 of the costs of that 100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5412.8s	5412.8	 I don't know why we're paying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5414.6s	5414.6	 For rich europeans when our country is massively in debt, why aren't we passing the bill to them for that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5421.9s	5421.9	 Yeah, yeah, we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5423.9s	5423.9	 absolutely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5425.2s	5425.2	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5426.8s	5426.8	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5427.8s	5427.8	 Do we have to spend that much money to do that? No, and then obviously the wars in the middle east were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5434.0s	5434.0	 Let me pick up on this little policeman idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5436.0s	5436.0	 What kind of policing works the best community policing when the policemen are from the neighborhood and they know all the players
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5441.6s	5441.6	 They understand the subtlety of the of the area exactly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5445.6s	5445.6	 The u.s. Has made itself the world's policeman. We parachute into areas that we don't understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5450.2s	5450.2	 We did in the middle east. It was very ineffective. What we should do is let the regions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5456.1s	5456.1	 Deal with the problems themselves first and we should be the policemen of last resort not first resort
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5462.0s	5462.0	 Let the europeans take the lead they should be paying for their own defense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5466.0s	5466.0	 You know, we could still have nato but they should be paying for it. They should be the first responders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5470.5s	5470.5	 And if they can't handle it then we can back them up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5473.7s	5473.7	 But this idea that we need to be on the bleeding edge of all these conflicts bankrupting ourselves. It's a foolish idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5481.7s	5481.7	 Energy independence is a solution to all of this. We wouldn't have to deal with these death spots if we didn't if we had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5487.2s	5487.2	 Energy independence, so we're getting we're getting circles run around us by china jason on the innovations front
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5494.7s	5494.7	 Circles run around us by china on the innovation front
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5496.9s	5496.9	 And example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5499.6s	5499.6	 I just told you the catl battery that they just announced today. Yeah, it's incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5504.2s	5504.2	 Yeah, I mean battery technologies. We we have a lot going on there as well. I mean it seems like the battery technology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5511.7s	5511.7	 Issue has been solved for evs for some time now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5514.3s	5514.3	 I mean if an ev can go 200 miles and we can build them at scale which seems like we're on the precipice of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5519.9s	5519.9	 Um, we're going to be good. You don't need more than 200 miles on average
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5522.9s	5522.9	 It's just a luxury every mile after that given how fast superchargers are working. So just practically speaking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5529.7s	5529.7	 95 of americans will do just fine with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5532.2s	5532.2	 A electric car that does 200 mile range and the other 5 can do a hybrid or can still burn oil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5538.5s	5538.5	 We just need to get more we have to be more serious about the miles per gallon right now. We are just absolutely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5546.1s	5546.1	 Abhorrent in our use of fuel in this country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5548.5s	5548.5	 It's just crazy that we have low 20 miles per gallon as our average when other countries are 30 40 50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5555.2s	5555.2	 You know, we're 30 and 40. It's because we like our you know, seven seat suburbans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5560.0s	5560.0	 Which is ridiculous because 99 out of 100 missions in that suburban are done with one or two people in it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5565.3s	5565.3	 The fact that our ubers, you know in our lifts or whatever are coming with giant suburbans with one person in it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5570.6s	5570.6	 Is just I have a I have a fiat e500 here like a little mini. Oh, it's incredible. Yeah, it's incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5576.8s	5576.8	 I mean, yeah, this is why I mean this is the path if we can just if you just think about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5581.7s	5581.7	 If we were to double our miles per gallon, there are cars right now that are doing 50 55 miles per gallon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5589.0s	5589.0	 We really have to be more punitive in terms of tax. Give me the forecast jake. Oh, what's gonna happen with biden?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5596.2s	5596.2	 Oh, okay. So I guess give me your give me your scorecard. Give me your grade. How's he doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5600.9s	5600.9	 For biden. Oh, it's it's disastrous. I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5604.1s	5604.1	 I think the only thing more disastrous than biden would be having trump do a second third and fourth term
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5609.5s	5609.5	 100 so but so play it out play it up. Well, I don't think he's gonna run again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5613.7s	5613.7	 I think they're gonna have you don't think it's gonna run again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5616.3s	5616.3	 I think they're I think between then and now if the economy keeps going the way it's going he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5620.8s	5620.8	 Would be a lame duck and impossible and I think he might say, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5624.1s	5624.1	 I'm gonna retire to spend time with my kids in my golden years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5626.9s	5626.9	 And they might convince him that him running again is a really bad idea and kamala harris is a disaster as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5632.8s	5632.8	 She hasn't proven anything in the first few years. Yeah, who would the dems put up jay cal jay cal as a democrat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5637.8s	5637.8	 Who would you want to have put up? I think it's gonna be desantis versus newsome in 24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5642.0s	5642.0	 I yeah, I um, but sorry explain that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5645.4s	5645.4	 Okay, so well which part of it newsome or desantis?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5648.9s	5648.9	 How does newsome get the nod?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5650.5s	5650.5	 Okay here so newsome has a very weak challenger in in california. It's a plus 30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5655.7s	5655.7	 Win hold on. So he's gonna handily win reelection in california
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5659.5s	5659.5	 He's already now he's not even campaigning for reelection in california
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5663.2s	5663.2	 He's already campaigning to be president the thing that he did that was politically smart
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5666.5s	5666.5	 And I say this not as a fan of newsome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5668.4s	5668.4	 But this is someone who's analyzing the politics of it is that he went on true social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5673.3s	5673.3	 And he to basically counter your republican lies. And so he's positioning himself as a fighter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5679.7s	5679.7	 For progressive values and the reason why that's gonna be flattering to the democratic base is that when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5686.4s	5686.4	 The democrats lose big in november, they're gonna have there's gonna be a reckoning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5690.5s	5690.5	 And they're gonna have to understand why they lost and the fact of the matter is that ideologues never blamed themselves or their agenda
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5697.3s	5697.3	 They were gonna say that it was not communicated well and that we needed a basically a better communicator who was a fighter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5704.2s	5704.2	 And so they will basically pin the blame even more on biden. And so newsome is positioning himself as that sort of democratic progressive fighter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5712.3s	5712.3	 If you go back remember when michael avonotti
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5714.9s	5714.9	 Like they were you know, progressives were talking about him as a presidential candidate for a brief minute. They swooned over him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5720.5s	5720.5	 Why did you go to jail?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5721.8s	5721.8	 Yes, he's in jail right now. It's a total grifter scumbag total grifter scumbag, but you gotta remember cnn had him on there every day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5729.0s	5729.0	 Because he was a fighter jacob says his name in the funniest way possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5733.2s	5733.2	 I remember in our poker game when like helmuth said he had no numbers on the jacob. What's this guy's name say his name
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5737.8s	5737.8	 michael avonotti
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5740.0s	5740.0	 I don't know how to pronounce it. I never met the guy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5744.9s	5744.9	 Uh is a disaster, uh, it's an interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5748.2s	5748.2	 Concept. Yeah, sex. Can you do you think the dems will give newsome the nod? Can he actually win in some of these?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5754.8s	5754.8	 These middle states well, you gotta remember this is true for both
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5759.2s	5759.2	 Parties that the general electorate does not pick the candidates the parties pick the candidates and the base of the party picks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5766.1s	5766.1	 They want someone that can win pennsylvania. They want someone that can win florida. Yeah, but yes and no, so if you remember
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5772.5s	5772.5	 When when bill clinton pulled the democratic party back to the center in 1992 and you know the whole democratic leadership council
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5778.5s	5778.5	 And they really remade the democratic party at that time as a more centrist party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5782.7s	5782.7	 They had just come off three disastrous presidential elections
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5786.6s	5786.6	 So reagan in 80 and 84 and then herbert walker bush in uh in 88
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5792.3s	5792.3	 So, you know, it took three big losses for them to rethink. I don't think progressives are going to rethink their agenda
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5800.3s	5800.3	 You know based on one midterm loss, even though I think it's going to be gargantuan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5804.9s	5804.9	 Later this year. So I think they need more losses to really reevaluate their agenda
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5809.8s	5809.8	 I mean look the activists in the party are deeply invested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5813.9s	5813.9	 In their agenda. They're just not going to give it up. They're going to blame it on a communication problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5818.0s	5818.0	 They're going to say let's find a new messenger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5820.2s	5820.2	 And newsome will seem like a younger fresh face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5825.1s	5825.1	 So I think that's how it could happen and if you look at the democratic bench
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5827.9s	5827.9	 He can also say can he also who else they got as the issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5834.1s	5834.1	 A booted jay jen aoc if they want to go full like crazy left would be and then if they want to go more moderate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5840.6s	5840.6	 That doesn't win an election. You got to find someone who can win the election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5845.8s	5845.8	 Governor of a big statey, which is as of now a hundred million hundred billion dollar surplus looks good for him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5853.0s	5853.0	 So yeah, I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5854.6s	5854.6	 Gavin it's a scenario. It's a scenario. But look, I think the question is will the republicans field trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5861.5s	5861.5	 after january 6th, and I I think the answer is no and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5865.6s	5865.6	 It's too shameful right to to do that. I I think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5869.2s	5869.2	 Look, I think trump's problem is you won't stop talking about the last election and I think elections are always about the future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5875.3s	5875.3	 And the republicans ultimately going to nominate a candidate who represents the future and no republicans want him as going out there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5882.2s	5882.2	 Trying to steal an election again. No republicans want that on their head. If you look at straw polls, okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5886.9s	5886.9	 If you look at straw polling, um desantis now is beating trump in straw polls in the republican party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5893.4s	5893.4	 Jonathan chape who is a pretty smart liberal definitely not a republican, but he's a sometimes has very smart observations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5899.1s	5899.1	 Remember the whole zero covid thing. Anyway, he has an article just today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5902.9s	5902.9	 Talking about how desantis has now eclipsed trump within the republican base
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5907.5s	5907.5	 And if you look at the numbers within if you if you poll fox news viewers and likely republican primary voters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5914.8s	5914.8	 Desantis is up a couple of points in the straw polls, but among fox news viewers. He's up like 10 to 14 points
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5921.2s	5921.2	 So in other words the republican base the activists who are the influencers they already have moved from trump to desantis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5929.1s	5929.1	 No, they love him. Yeah. Yeah, so I think the field the fifth desantis runs. He's gonna run. He's gonna win a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5935.1s	5935.1	 A landslide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5937.1s	5937.1	 This is why I say it's desantis versus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5939.4s	5939.4	 Uh newsome I think but look it could be desantis versus biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5942.3s	5942.3	 It could even be trump versus newsome. I think the configurations that win for the republicans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5947.4s	5947.4	 I think if biden's on the ticket, I think any republican wins. I think if it's desantis versus newsome, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5953.8s	5953.8	 Desantis wins. I think however, and this is sort of the nightmare scenario. I think if it's something like a newson versus trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5960.9s	5960.9	 I think republicans could lose that just because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5963.7s	5963.7	 You know the people people think about the future they they they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5968.6s	5968.6	 They don't want to be reminded of the past and um, so I think there's risk there. No more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5974.6s	5974.6	 Insane and deranged you can't you can't have trying to steal an election running for president
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5979.8s	5979.8	 No, that would be great. Yes. Yeah, I think all right nothing against 75 years old would be good for me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6-PXMdmPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=38&t=5985.0s	5985.0	 All right. This has been a this has been a very long episode. Well, yeah
