https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=0.0s	0.0	 Any word from the dictator? Should we just do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1.9s	1.9	 I don't know, man. I got it. I cannot spend my whole day sitting on zoom waiting for Chimac.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=7.0s	7.0	 Or I could have Brad Gershner come on and sit in for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=9.0s	9.0	 Isn't he richer than Chimac?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=10.5s	10.5	 He is now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=11.0s	11.0	 The largest SPAC in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=12.4s	12.4	 Should we do that? Should I just have Brad come on the pod?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=14.5s	14.5	 Oh my God. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=15.6s	15.6	 We have a new SPAC king.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=16.6s	16.6	 Oh, sorry. We have a new SPAC king.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=18.0s	18.0	 Start it now. Get him on. Start it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=19.7s	19.7	 Yo, that's a great idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=21.3s	21.3	 Chimac comes in later. He's like, what the fuck? We're like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=22.9s	22.9	 we replaced you with the new SPAC king.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=25.0s	25.0	 Oh my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=25.6s	25.6	 Oh my God. Get him on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=27.0s	27.0	 Is this like a kidnapping and you guys are going to take me out and drop me out behind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=32.2s	32.2	 the railroad cars? What's going on here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=34.4s	34.4	 Okay. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=35.3s	35.3	 Here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=36.2s	36.2	 I'm good. Is it? How's the game?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=38.4s	38.4	 Game is great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=39.0s	39.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=39.5s	39.5	 Game three.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=41.4s	41.4	 Game two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=57.0s	57.0	 Hey everybody. Hey everybody. It's another episode of the All In Podcast. We took last week off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=65.4s	65.4	 because it was spring break and we all needed a break. Hope you had a great one too with us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=69.5s	69.5	 today. Of course, the queen of Quinoa from an undisclosed sunny location, David Friedberg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=76.6s	76.6	 It looks like Redwood City. Is it Redwood City?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=78.9s	78.9	 A rain man himself, David Sacks ready for governorsacks.com. And of course,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=84.6s	84.6	 the king of all SPACs, Brad Gerstner is with us again. The new dictator filling in for Chamath
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=91.1s	91.1	 Polyhapitiya, the dictator. Oh wait, Chamath Polyhapitiya, the dictator is here as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=96.2s	96.2	 And special bestie, Gessie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=98.2s	98.2	 Jason, Jason, Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=101.4s	101.4	 Not when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=105.4s	105.4	 I don't know what that means, but we're editing that out of the show. That's a bunch of beeps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=110.8s	110.8	 But welcome Brad sitting in just for a moment here because Chamath was gonna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=115.6s	115.6	 blow us off. He was an OSHO. We needed a SPAC king.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=119.7s	119.7	 Sorry guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=122.6s	122.6	 Emergency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=123.9s	123.9	 It's just a little flattery for Chamath. The truth of the matter is Chamath is pioneering here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=130.6s	130.6	 And you know, I think it's been incredible to watch the competition in choice. And as Chamath
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=138.2s	138.2	 knows, I participated in a couple of the deals that he's done. And I think we all share the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=144.2s	144.2	 feeling, which is, you know, there's been a system that is pretty Byzantine that wasn't serving the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=152.0s	152.0	 founders who we all care deeply about. And so I'm just, I'm thrilled whether it's direct lists,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=159.0s	159.0	 like Roblox did a few weeks ago that we helped do and, you know, or whether it's Chamath and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=164.4s	164.4	 incredible innovation that he's helping to do or, you know, we're lucky we've invested,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=170.8s	170.8	 you know, in building a capital markets business on top of this SPAC and then, you know, worked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=177.2s	177.2	 with Grav to bring a great public company out this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=181.2s	181.2	 So let's get to the direct listing. Good segue. Clearly the biggest news of the week is Coinbase,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=187.4s	187.4	 the largest direct listing ever. Bill Gurley somewhere is smiling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=191.5s	191.5	 And that's on top of Roblox, which I think was the second biggest 2020 revenue 1.2 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=197.9s	197.9	 Sorry, Brad, did snowflake direct list or that was a traditional?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=201.3s	201.3	 No, that's traditional idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=202.7s	202.7	 Traditional idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=203.5s	203.5	 I don't know who got their bet week, their wet their beaks on this one. Sax, did you have a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=208.6s	208.6	 bit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=209.9s	209.9	 I had a little tasty poo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=211.3s	211.3	 Little tasty poo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=212.5s	212.5	 I had, I had a lot showered upon me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=217.6s	217.6	 Explain boys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=218.4s	218.4	 Because you're, because you're in Ribbet, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=220.1s	220.1	 I am, I was Mickey's, one of Mickey's largest LPs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=223.9s	223.9	 Who's Mickey for the audience who doesn't know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=225.6s	225.6	 Mickey Malca who runs a Ribbet capital who owns 7% or 10% or 7 or 8% of Coinbase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=233.1s	233.1	 And what was incredible was I got distributed all of it yesterday, which by the way, I think for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=238.4s	238.4	 direct listing, the strategy to me makes a lot of sense. I made a mistake in hindsight. If I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=244.2s	244.2	 about my distribution strategy, because myself, Excel and Andreessen, when we did the slack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=248.9s	248.9	 direct listing, we distributed probably five, 10%. And then we waited and then we trickled it out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=254.6s	254.6	 over time. But by definition, I think the price action on direct listings shows you that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=259.1s	259.1	 top tick the top price at the moment on the open print. And so, you know, if you're going to sell,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=265.6s	265.6	 you're probably better off selling absolutely right away. And if you look at the price action
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=269.4s	269.4	 on direct listings, it's basically been one way direction down from the point of the direct
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=273.7s	273.7	 listing. Spotify did that for two years, it kind of languished, you know, slack did that until the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=278.7s	278.7	 Salesforce acquisition. So in general, I think if a direct listing happens, when you get distributed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=285.4s	285.4	 the stock, you should probably sell it right away. And that means it was priced correctly as opposed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=292.1s	292.1	 to underpriced. Is that what we should take from that? Well, no, because there's no price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=297.3s	297.3	 What's TBD is what is the morale hit to the company to see a one way direction down in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=302.6s	302.6	 you know, a stairway down on the stock price. So maybe it was good for selling shareholders,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=307.0s	307.0	 it's not necessarily good for the morale of employees, which then could impact the long term
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=310.9s	310.9	 enterprise value that's being built at a company. So I think there's a bunch of TBDs, I do think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=315.4s	315.4	 direct listings are administratively clean in some ways. But company building may not necessarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=321.5s	321.5	 win. But you had a point of view, I think it was last year or two years ago about how, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=326.8s	326.8	 and I read some papers that one of the analysts at Wall Street put out showing that there isn't much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=332.7s	332.7	 of a benefit to lockups with respect to short or long term price volatility. Do you still hold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=339.0s	339.0	 that point of view? I think lockups are really unfair because they're attacks on the people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=345.6s	345.6	 that have been there the longest, which are the employees. So, you know, the idea that somebody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=350.2s	350.2	 that comes in at the absolute last minute, you know, Brad and I have done a bunch of IPOs recently,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=355.9s	355.9	 where he'd like you get allocations in a book, he and I had nothing to do with companies, but we get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=360.1s	360.1	 its shares and we sell it day one. Then there are people that have been in that company for six,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=364.2s	364.2	 seven, eight, nine, 10 years, who sit around, you know, twiddling their thumbs, watching all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=369.0s	369.0	 these other people make one day returns. There was a tweet that Bill Gurley had yesterday that says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=375.0s	375.0	 there's a well known crossover fund that over the last year has printed a billion dollars of one day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=380.4s	380.4	 share gains. Well, that's crazy. So I think that lockups are kind of a regressive tax on the people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=387.9s	387.9	 that do the work and they are just rewarding people that have nothing to do with companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=392.1s	392.1	 Brad, what do you do in Grab? Because you locked yourself up, right, for a couple of years?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=396.1s	396.1	 And is there a lockup for the existing shareholders in Grab?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=399.7s	399.7	 Yeah. So first, I totally agree with Chamath. Lockups are one of the most insidious things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=404.9s	404.9	 I think, about the traditional IPO process. You know, the fact that DoorDash employees are sitting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=410.5s	410.5	 there watching the stock go from 100 to 200, and then, you know, all these other folks are selling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=415.0s	415.0	 while they watch the stock go from 200 back to 100, I would think is incredibly demoralizing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=420.3s	420.3	 And it doesn't, here's the thing, it doesn't need to exist. In Roblox, there was no lockup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=426.1s	426.1	 The employees were free to sell, but guess what? A lot of them chose not to sell,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=430.1s	430.1	 right? It's fairer and quicker price discovery when you actually allow the supply and demand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=436.5s	436.5	 to exist in balance. So what we did at Grab was we fought hard for the most open, unlocked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=445.4s	445.4	 day one we could possibly get. In that case, there are a lot of big shareholders who are on the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=450.6s	450.6	 So they're deemed affiliates under Section 16 of security laws. So they can't sell, right? They're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=455.8s	455.8	 deemed to be insiders, right? But we, at the end of the day, all employees can sell. There is a group
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=462.4s	462.4	 of senior management that said, hey, we want to voluntarily lock. It's a signal to the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=467.0s	467.0	 But all other employees in the company can sell. So there are over 5,000 employees in the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=472.2s	472.2	 And all of the early shareholders can sell on day one. And I think this was the first time I've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=478.6s	478.6	 seen this in this alternative IPO. So we have almost a third of the entire share base of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=486.2s	486.2	 company that is available for sale on day one. Incredible. Hey, Brad, can I ask one more question?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=490.8s	490.8	 The economics for Grab, are they better under your structure than they would have been for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=499.0s	499.0	 traditional IPO to get the same amount of capital and they're paying 7% to the underwriting banks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=504.2s	504.2	 As we all know, Bill Gurley has laboriously pointed out and documented that there are two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=511.9s	511.9	 expenses to a traditional IPO. There's the upfront fee, 5.5%, 6%, whatever they're paying on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=517.9s	517.9	 amount of capital raised. But he would argue the much bigger expense is the indirect cost of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=524.6s	524.6	 structural underpricing. So in a traditional IPO, let's say you have a $10 billion enterprise value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=529.8s	529.8	 raising a billion dollars. If it's being underpriced, he would argue structurally by 40%. We can all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=535.2s	535.2	 debate that, but that's $400 million of dilution to employees and to existing shareholders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=541.4s	541.4	 I think everybody in the Grab process, both the buy side portfolio managers from Fidelity, Janice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=550.1s	550.1	 T-Row, et cetera, as well as the company believe that we got a 20% to 30% higher price than a bank
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=558.0s	558.0	 would have got because of the conviction the portfolio's managers had as a result of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=563.5s	563.5	 significant investment we were making in the company as a result of the fact that we were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=567.7s	567.7	 locking up our promote shares, our sponsor shares for three years. If you say it's 30% on a $4 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=575.3s	575.3	 raise, that's over a billion dollars of savings, over a billion dollars of indirect cost savings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=580.9s	580.9	 to the employees and the shareholders. For me, Arnor Star is founders. We literally have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=589.4s	589.4	 deconstructed the IPO at every step of the value chain. To say, Rich Barton, my thought partner in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=595.9s	595.9	 this, he's on the board of Netflix when it went public, took Zillow Public, took Expedia Public,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=601.0s	601.0	 and he said, we can make this better at every step of the value chain. So we've thought about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=605.2s	605.2	 it like a product and we build in a capital markets business that says part of it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=610.6s	610.6	 eliminating the commission, part of it is getting a fairer price, but part of it is curating that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=615.6s	615.6	 day one cap table because these companies are stepping into the public markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=621.8s	621.8	 As Rich has said and others have said, think about all the curation that goes into a private cap table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=627.8s	627.8	 Now, when you go public, Rich calls it a cap table randomization event.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=632.8s	632.8	 You lose total control over your cap table. Whereas in the case of Grab, we hand selected
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=639.4s	639.4	 what we think are the world's best public market shareholders to be their day one cap table. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=643.4s	643.4	 it's a very different outcome and it's not just about cost savings. It's not just about trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=649.1s	649.1	 get a fairer price. It's actually making the process better at each step of the value chain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=653.4s	653.4	 All right. So we were talking about Coinbase last year when they had a big brouhaha and Brian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=658.5s	658.5	 Armstrong said, we are not going to talk about politics inside the company. You can have political
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=665.8s	665.8	 views, but not inside the company. Sachs, you did some tweets about this. What are your thoughts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=671.0s	671.0	 Yeah, I mean, apparently, Coinbase's ban on politics in the workplace and their refusal to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=681.0s	681.0	 submit to New York Times interviews did not prevent them from creating an $85 billion company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=686.0s	686.0	 I'm shocked that they were able to do that. That's basically what I tweeted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=693.2s	693.2	 It just shows that founders can do things their own way. They don't have to submit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=696.7s	696.7	 to the woke mob. That's basically what I tweeted. It's been interesting to see the reactions. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=704.8s	704.8	 first day, I got like 10,000 likes. Then the second day, it seemed like some sort of SOS went out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=711.4s	711.4	 Now I've been sort of surrounded. There's been this outcry. My takeaway is that the woke mob
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=716.7s	716.7	 really doesn't like to be called out as a woke mob. They're sort of surrounding me with pitchforks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=723.7s	723.7	 now saying, how dare you call us a mob? Sachs, are you running for governor because it looks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=729.8s	729.8	 like you've taken Botox? Did you take Botox? He's in Miami, so it's probably... He's going on with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=736.8s	736.8	 your cheeks and your face. Your lips are incredibly swollen. I mean, they look very succulent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=744.1s	744.1	 It's unbelievable. I've got a new lens. I've got five different technologies slimming me here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=750.9s	750.9	 But you do have your pin on today and you do look very governorial. I noticed that you bought...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=756.0s	756.0	 I'm wearing my Miami pin. This is my city of Miami pin. Francis gave you that pin. Francis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=760.7s	760.7	 gave me the pin. That's fantastic. Did he tell you never call me Francis?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=767.0s	767.0	 What is the big announcement today? We're really excited to hear it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=770.5s	770.5	 Yeah. Tell us governorsachs.com. What do you got on deck?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=774.3s	774.3	 There's nothing. This is a Jason construction. I don't want to get the...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=779.2s	779.2	 Do we have an exploratory committee set up yet? Let's get Sachs out of the game. I need that deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=784.2s	784.2	 I mean, guys, guys, obviously if this comes to pass, we're going to rewrite history as David
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=788.6s	788.6	 Sachs was our Manchurian candidate. I floated the trial balloon. There was a layup for David
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=793.9s	793.9	 Sachs to come and alley-oop and dunk on Gavin Newsom. No luck. Come on, Sachs, do it. The world needs...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=800.7s	800.7	 I tell you, Newsom is doing everything in his power to blow this recall because, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=806.0s	806.0	 timing is working in his favor. I mean, he's done a horrible job on everything vaccine related,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=810.6s	810.6	 but the reality is COVID is winding down. It's going to be over. So even though he delayed...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=816.6s	816.6	 Everyone getting the vaccine by weeks, if not months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=819.6s	819.6	 Months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=820.7s	820.7	 Probably, yeah, by months. We've got 7 million unused doses sitting on the shelf in California
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=824.7s	824.7	 because of all of his crazy eligibility requirements. Despite all of that, by the time we actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=829.3s	829.3	 get around to the recall, which will be in about five or six months, the recall election,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=835.1s	835.1	 the economy is going to be booming again. COVID is going to be over. People will probably forget,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=840.4s	840.4	 but for the fact that he is now saying that he cannot guarantee that schools will reopen in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=845.7s	845.7	 fall. So we now have schools reopen in, you know, every public schools reopen basically in every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=852.2s	852.2	 other state. You now have private schools are all reopened in California and he still cannot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=857.5s	857.5	 guarantee that schools will be reopened, not now, but in the fall. David, throw down the gauntlet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=864.0s	864.0	 Yeah, make the guarantee that if you will open all the public schools,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=869.8s	869.8	 day one. Yeah. And I'm not, this is the window, David, now or never. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=875.6s	875.6	 saying that, that I'm running, but one thing I would say is that whoever does, what about if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=880.2s	880.2	 ran? If I ran, I would 100% absolutely guarantee that school was opened in the fall. What we need,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=887.0s	887.0	 what we need is a governor who will go to the teachers unions and say, listen, you will either
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=893.0s	893.0	 report for duty the first day of school, five days a week, no exceptions, or you go look for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=898.4s	898.4	 another career. That is what we need. David Sachs, David Sachs, David Sachs, more, more, more, more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=907.5s	907.5	 I'm not running, I'm not running, I'm not running. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Can you make all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=911.5s	911.5	 vending machines free? Yeah, sure. We can do that too. Okay. Can you, can you get rid of all my debt?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=917.3s	917.3	 Yeah, why not? Okay. I'm in. Can we go back to the, to the markets just for one second?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=924.2s	924.2	 Because I just want to, I want to ask a couple of questions. Brad, Q1 was nuts. Let's get some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=929.6s	929.6	 color commentary from a big player in the capital markets. You talk us through us, talk to us through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=936.6s	936.6	 what factor rotation was, talk to us about your reactions to this Archegos capital thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=944.8s	944.8	 about inflation. Also gut check. Like what is the, what is, what does the rest of the year look like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=951.2s	951.2	 Just how, what's your sentiment? How are you feeling? Just give us a reaction on just the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=955.0s	955.0	 economy. And the gut check, Brad, on, weren't you like the biggest shareholder United at some point?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=960.7s	960.7	 And then you just got Wallop? Oh yeah, that was a bad way to start off 2020. Yeah, I want to hear about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=964.7s	964.7	 It was a bad way to start off 2020. However, I would say that it ended up being the best year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=969.5s	969.5	 in the history of the firm. And so, you know, like we, like everybody else had to reinvent a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=974.5s	974.5	 things about our business last year. And we learned a lot from that moment and the courage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=980.6s	980.6	 that a lot of people at United showed through that period of time, without a lot of help,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=985.8s	985.8	 a lot of people think the government was helpful. There's a lot of unhelpful things that were being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=989.6s	989.6	 done, but notwithstanding that fact, to Chema's point, Chema, I think I went on CNBC in November
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=995.7s	995.7	 and just said, like, when we normalize, there's no reason that the 10 years shouldn't be back at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1002.1s	1002.1	 level it was in January 20. Right. And for every 1% move in the 10 year, you've got a 10 to a 20%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1008.6s	1008.6	 drawdown in growth multiples. And the reason for that is very simple. They're long duration assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1013.7s	1013.7	 You discount them back at a higher rate. And so you have multiple compression. And so we were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1018.3s	1018.3	 starting at an all time high in terms of growth equity multiples for both software and internet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1023.2s	1023.2	 When you look at October, November of last year, we've seen about 30 to 40% retracement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1031.2s	1031.2	 or give back in terms of those multiples. Right. And some names it's bigger and some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1037.0s	1037.0	 names it's less. I suspect that there's another 10 to 20% to go for a 10 year that's going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1044.2s	1044.2	 sitting here at 1.8. I just got done talking as part of this roadshow, as you know, to all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1049.7s	1049.7	 biggest growth equity portfolio managers on the public buy side, I can tell you they're all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1054.6s	1054.6	 deleveraging growth. They are not adding, they're not looking to add dollars to growth. And these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1059.3s	1059.3	 are the biggest managers in the world. And so we're not through that process. There are some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1064.8s	1064.8	 people who've anchored themselves to the fact that zoom was just at 500. They're like, oh my God,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1068.9s	1068.9	 it's going straight back to 500. You're like, no, 500 was the outlier event. That was the all time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1074.6s	1074.6	 high multiple event. It will get there in the fullness of time, but it's going to have to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1078.2s	1078.2	 there through earning. So what do you think then happens in the privates? And, you know, there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1083.2s	1083.2	 lot of talk about certain firms, some of your competitors in the growth stage side ripping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1088.4s	1088.4	 capital into companies every 24 hours or 48 hours. Where does that then normalize? Because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1094.6s	1094.6	 aren't we setting up a dynamic where if you have a bunch of growth firms pricing crazy rounds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1101.0s	1101.0	 whose valuations can then will not be able to be held up in the public markets, aren't we creating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1107.1s	1107.1	 a different kind of problem? Well, you know, you and I've watched this dynamic play out probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1113.4s	1113.4	 four or five times over the course of the last 15 years, where there's this inversion, private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1117.8s	1117.8	 capital markets, private markets are actually overvalued relative to public markets. I just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1122.1s	1122.1	 look at a few IPOs this week, over the last couple of weeks, Deliveroo, hot private company down 30%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1127.8s	1127.8	 in the IPO. AppLovin came out this week, 20% down in the IPO. At the end of the day, the great day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1135.3s	1135.3	 as Munger likes to say, the markets are a voting machine and the public markets are a brutal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1139.9s	1139.9	 voting machine. And so, you know, it just is going to take, remember when Groupon got done that last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1146.2s	1146.2	 private round at 20 billion, and then about nine months later is trading at 5 billion or Zynga.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1151.4s	1151.4	 I mean, you and I go through the list, we've watched this, you know, so it just takes the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1155.9s	1155.9	 smackdown and people losing actual money. And however, so that's the one side, right? This is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1163.1s	1163.1	 a temporary dynamic markets will clear. I think it is possible you reference, you know, a good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1169.8s	1169.8	 friend of mine, you know, who's supposedly writing a term sheet every two days, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1176.6s	1176.6	 at Tiger, the truth of the matter is you can hold simultaneous truths. You can believe the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1182.2s	1182.2	 next three months that we're likely to have more multiple compression in the public markets, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1187.4s	1187.4	 You could hedge your public book in a variety of ways against that, like we did and announced last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1193.3s	1193.3	 December. And at the same time, you can believe that the secular trend in technology has never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1199.1s	1199.1	 been more potent, right? And I believe that if you own an index of the top 30% of technology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1204.9s	1204.9	 companies in the world today, and you're willing to hold them for five to 10 years, you will be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1209.3s	1209.3	 incredibly well rewarded. The most asymmetric bet maybe in the history of all of investing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1216.3s	1216.3	 is having a golden ticket to have access to the best technology companies in the world today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1221.8s	1221.8	 It's like unfair play. And everybody on this call is playing in what is a highly asymmetric
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1228.2s	1228.2	 and unfair game stacked in our favor. Now we can screw that up by trying to think we're good at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1233.0s	1233.0	 short term trading or doing a bunch of other stuff, we can get individual things wrong. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1236.9s	1236.9	 if you bet on the top, the top quartile of technology companies on a global basis, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1242.5s	1242.5	 Tiger and others are doing, and you have time on your side, you're going to be well rewarded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1248.8s	1248.8	 We talked about the mid market late stage venture space being a no man's land of vortex,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1257.4s	1257.4	 the value being created in the late stage and value being created in the early stage,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1260.5s	1260.5	 but the money in the middle becoming a commodity, because of Tiger Co two and others coming in and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1264.7s	1264.7	 just coming over the top. Do you subscribe to that? Brad, do you think that's just a financial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1269.8s	1269.8	 transaction in the middle and not a lot of value to be made there? Or do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1274.3s	1274.3	 You know, listen, it doesn't matter in snowflake whether you invested in the 100 million dollar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1278.6s	1278.6	 round, the 200 million dollar round, the 500 million dollar round, the billion dollar round
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1282.6s	1282.6	 where Sequoia came in. If the company is going to two, three, four hundred billion dollars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1289.4s	1289.4	 all of those are extraordinary returns. So Altimeter has described itself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1293.9s	1293.9	 often as a life cycle investor. I represent the biggest portion of the capital in the firm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1299.5s	1299.5	 some long term endowments are number two and number three, and we have a multi decade view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1303.9s	1303.9	 on the world. And our view is the one that I just articulated. I want to have maximum dollars. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1308.6s	1308.6	 don't care that it's all in the B or the C or the D or the IPO or, you know, I want to have maximum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1314.2s	1314.2	 dollars behind our best ideas. And I want to be an incredible partner to these companies as they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1319.4s	1319.4	 move through the life cycle. And part of the reason we build a capital markets business to help
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1324.1s	1324.1	 founders in a better way, step into the public markets is it's part of our mission. Right? Like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1329.4s	1329.4	 I want to, you know how frustrating it was to me, Jason, to be pre-MAR or pre IPO and Mongo or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1336.1s	1336.1	 Twilio or Okta. And then when it came to the IPO, I have to go to the banks and grovel,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1341.5s	1341.5	 right? And grovel for an allocation and they dribble five or 10 million. And I see them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1346.2s	1346.2	 handing big, you know, big allocations to people who I know are going to flip it. And I actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1351.7s	1351.7	 want to own this stuff. It's very frustrating. And so we think there's a better way. And when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1355.8s	1355.8	 those companies come public in the future. You said something which I want to use as a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1360.6s	1360.6	 question to Friedberg and Sachs and Jason, because these guys are involved very sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1366.2s	1366.2	 in one way and what I'm going to say, which is you said gross tonnage of dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1369.8s	1369.8	 One of the most incredible things that I thought about the Coinbase S1 was the amount of unbelievably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1380.2s	1380.2	 smart buying that Andreessen did. And I thought to myself, Andreessen just out Sequoia at Sequoia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1386.7s	1386.7	 And what do you guys think about sort of how they've been able to, to actually execute? It
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1392.2s	1392.2	 just seems like Andreessen is done an incredible, incredible job. I don't want to, I mean, Jason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1398.5s	1398.5	 you're close to Sequoia. So are you Friedberg. I just want you to react to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1403.7s	1403.7	 No, you got to get, you got to give them credit on Coinbase because I think they made the,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1407.8s	1407.8	 they made the most money, I guess, Ribbit and Gary Tan and Initialized may have made the highest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1414.0s	1414.0	 ROI because they invested a smaller amount of dollars earlier. My return, my return in Ribbit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1419.0s	1419.0	 was the, the Maya from iconic told me was 506 times. Right. Exactly. So, so, so Ribbit made the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1426.3s	1426.3	 500X and I guess Andreessen, but Andreessen made like 20 billion of returns of which, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1433.8s	1433.8	 they're probably getting 25, 30%. So they, they made the most money. It may not have been the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1439.9s	1439.9	 highest IRR, but it was the most money. And you're right. They doubled down in this like 2018,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1443.5s	1443.5	 2019 period. It sounded like they were doing a bunch of secondary buying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1447.1s	1447.1	 They were buying the stock at 25 bucks. Yeah. They bought it all from Fred Wilson in Union Square.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1451.7s	1451.7	 Right. They were buying it from other investors. Yeah. They were just, they did what Sokka did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1456.1s	1456.1	 with Twitter, right? And with Uber and started buying Oculus positions. But they did it, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1460.3s	1460.3	 they did it at a time where people were losing faith in crypto. There was like, you remember,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1464.6s	1464.6	 there's like this big crypto boom. The crypto win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1467.1s	1467.1	 Yeah. There was a big crypto boom in like, I'd say December of 2017, January 2018, and then it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1475.1s	1475.1	 kind of collapsed and that mirrors the price of Bitcoin. You had Bitcoin reach a peak of about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1479.3s	1479.3	 20,000 that crashed all the way down to three or 4,000. Obviously that was a great time to buy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1484.7s	1484.7	 Bitcoin, but it sounds like these guys were also buying Coinbase at that time. So that was a pretty,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1490.5s	1490.5	 that was a remarkable doubling down. By the way, it's a good validation of Brad's point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1495.6s	1495.6	 about market perturbations being fairly independent of value creation over the long run.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1500.7s	1500.7	 And if you have faith that this is where value will be created over a period of 10 plus years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1508.8s	1508.8	 when you have an opportunity to buy in, buy in and don't let the market perturbations drive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1512.9s	1512.9	 your decision making or else you end up in this market trading trap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1516.9s	1516.9	 Yeah. I think we've talked about this a lot. Warren Buffett talks about it a lot. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1520.2s	1520.2	 Chamath, you've made the point about not timing the markets, but your time in the markets. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1525.3s	1525.3	 this notion that when you have conviction in a business or an idea or a thesis, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1530.2s	1530.2	 you can continue to double down on that conviction, regardless of whether you think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1533.4s	1533.4	 relative valuations are appropriate or kind of disjoin it at the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1537.4s	1537.4	 It's even more acute because what happens is we make short-term decisions and then those short-term
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1543.0s	1543.0	 decisions oftentimes to prove to be right in the short term. And let me give you an example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1548.3s	1548.3	 And then it leads to behavioral lock-in. So at the end of 2014, Bitcoin's at $1,100 a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1555.1s	1555.1	 We get, I get very interested in crypto. I think this is one of the most asymmetric bets I see in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1560.1s	1560.1	 the world, right? I think it's a low probability event, but if you win, the size of the prize is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1565.5s	1565.5	 absolutely gigantic, right? So we're looking at a deal with Andreessen because I thought
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1571.9s	1571.9	 Balaji was one of the smartest people in the space. The company was called 21.co, idea of mining for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1577.8s	1577.8	 Bitcoin on a chip. On the eve of the deal, my partner and I, I said, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1584.0s	1584.0	 I believe that we should place our bet in Bitcoin because I'm not sure whether or not this mining
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1589.9s	1589.9	 company is actually going to work out. Okay. So we pass on the deal. Bitcoin goes from $1,200 to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1597.7s	1597.7	 $300 in like a straight line down. And what was my takeaway? My takeaway was like, man, I'm so smart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1604.8s	1604.8	 I'm so smart. We passed on that deal. Okay. Rather than being curious, rather than learning more,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1611.0s	1611.0	 rather than developing it. And what Andreessen did during that period of time is they stuck to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1617.3s	1617.3	 their belief that this could be a highly asymmetric outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1621.4s	1621.4	 Ultimately, I ran into Katie Hahn, a board member at Coinbase the night of the IPO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1625.9s	1625.9	 And she said, Brad, you know, do you remember, you know, 21.co? I was like, yeah. She goes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1632.4s	1632.4	 those were some of our original shares in Coinbase. We sold that company to Coinbase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1637.1s	1637.1	 Wow. Right. And, you know, it's just for me, I sent this note to our team because I said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1643.7s	1643.7	 you know what guys, in the face of having some good wins, I want to remind you of some really potent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1651.1s	1651.1	 near wins and misses. And my mistake at that point in time was I lacked mental flexibility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1657.0s	1657.0	 I got locked into this idea that I was really smart by having missed 21.co rather than learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1664.2s	1664.2	 from that moment and saying, listen, when I started to see it move and then it moved pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1668.4s	1668.4	 quickly and I was like, oh, I missed it. It's just like a stock. We do the same thing. The reality is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1673.8s	1673.8	 you should allocate to things that you think are thematically highly asymmetric and great ideas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1679.9s	1679.9	 And this was one of them and one we missed. Can I just kind of say something to that? I was in 21.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1686.0s	1686.0	 That's 21.06. I don't remember getting any Coinbase shares. So somebody, you did not own the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1693.6s	1693.6	 preferred preferred preferred preferred. I did own preferred. I invested in clear the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1701.8s	1701.8	 press stack wrong series with one thing I'll add to that is you have to look at the mandate of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1707.7s	1707.7	 these funds. If you're an early stage fund, and you have the ability to sell at 500 X or 1000 X or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1713.7s	1713.7	 2000 X, sometimes you've got to lock that in and give something to your LPs. And I think this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1719.4s	1719.4	 where you know, thinking full lifecycle, you said, Jamal, like, what did you learn from all this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1723.5s	1723.5	 Well, if you're building a business, right? Well, I mean, one of the things I learned is I didn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1727.8s	1727.8	 even know what pro rata really was when I started my career, I didn't do pro rata in Uber or anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1733.7s	1733.7	 And now my position is I am going super pro rata in our winners. So not only holding winners,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1739.8s	1739.8	 I'm trying to get to 10 15% ownership in these companies. And it's starting to happen, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1744.9s	1744.9	 with companies that are worth 500 or 700 million. And so that that is the economic that's the change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1750.1s	1750.1	 in behavior I'm doing, which is, you know, to your point, if you bought snowflake at any time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1754.9s	1754.9	 you feel great about it. But then you have to have buy in from your LPs that they agree with that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1759.5s	1759.5	 and that they're okay with you taking a longer strategy. And then at some point, you want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1763.3s	1763.3	 return capital. And that becomes super problematic. You're in seven, eight, nine, 10 of your fund,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1768.4s	1768.4	 you want to take some chips off the table. And so what I'm going to do now is, I think I'm going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1773.9s	1773.9	 try to do both where I have a group of LPs who want to buy shares. And I don't know how to figure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1779.0s	1779.0	 this out. And maybe somebody could advise me here. Because I have had other venture firms who had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1784.2s	1784.2	 this challenge, where the growth group I don't want anything you want. So well, no, no, I know that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1796.4s	1796.4	 Why do you say yourself? Yeah, like that? Yeah, I'm looking for advice here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1799.8s	1799.8	 But the whole point of this podcast is for me to draft off people who are smarter than me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1805.4s	1805.4	 Mission accomplished. So here we go. Yeah, we still have to teach you how to set up an LLC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1809.6s	1809.6	 to buy your house. I'm doing the process. Sorry, I'm an idiot. Nouveau rich. But here's the issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1817.4s	1817.4	 Can I be an angel investor in Uber, and then be selling shares in Uber to my other LPs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1825.1s	1825.1	 and creating that soccer secondary market? Or is that conflicted? You know what I'm saying?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1829.1s	1829.1	 I'll tell you, you know, I think this is public. I don't know if it's public, I will say it anyway,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1834.9s	1834.9	 because I think it's well known. But founders fund had early SpaceX shares that they thought
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1839.6s	1839.6	 it was prudent to sell in the early funds, those SpaceX shares, the later fund was buying SpaceX
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1845.0s	1845.0	 shares in that round. And so they were in a circumstance where they had such a big markup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1849.8s	1849.8	 on the early round, the early fund, that they had to kind of distribute and liquidate those SpaceX
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1855.0s	1855.0	 shares. Meanwhile, they're somewhat with a good overlap of LPs were buying in the other fund
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1860.0s	1860.0	 at that at that higher price. You are speaking to something I lived out in the early venture funds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1865.4s	1865.4	 of social capital, because when it was not entirely my own capital base, I felt that pressure and I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1871.8s	1871.8	 did similar things because I was like, Oh, wow, we're in year seven, eight, nine. Yes. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1877.8s	1877.8	 and I had great LPs. It's like, wait, how can I not give capital back to the Broad or Mayo? These
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1884.1s	1884.1	 are phenomenal institutions. They weren't pressuring me at all. But I felt internal pressure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1889.6s	1889.6	 and I started to make suboptimal decisions for myself, I couldn't make really, you know, clearly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1895.8s	1895.8	 the best optimized decision, which would have been to hold everything as long as possible, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1900.5s	1900.5	 to your point, like if you're in the top quartile of things, the best thing is to never sell. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1905.4s	1905.4	 it's an incredibly special place where you can actually have that freedom to do it. But it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1910.6s	1910.6	 what's interesting is, I actually think the folks that are in the best position to do are actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1914.8s	1914.8	 employees. And I actually think that they're, they're randomly doing this. When you look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1918.6s	1918.6	 the churn rates of employees today, like I saw this crazy stat, the average tenure at Uber is 1.8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1925.0s	1925.0	 years. That's crazy. The average tenure at Tesla is 2.1 years. The average tenure at Google is 3.2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1931.0s	1931.0	 years. So if you think about a traditional 10 year career in the valley, you have somewhere between,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1935.7s	1935.7	 you know, three and five, three and five different baskets of shares that you're getting. And, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1941.4s	1941.4	 know, those are, those are costless options effectively. That's actually an incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1945.4s	1945.4	 form of portfolio construction for these people, because if you never have to sell those things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1949.7s	1949.7	 you can wait till they go public and you can underwrite them forever. That's probably what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1954.1s	1954.1	 a lot of employees in Silicon Valley have figured out implicitly. I have a question I want to ask
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1958.0s	1958.0	 you guys as well, which is, I just want to go back to the public markets for a second. I tweeted out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1961.8s	1961.8	 some of these amazing things I learned from the Bezos. Oh my god, this is demented. Did you guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1967.8s	1967.8	 see what I tweeted? I saw your tweet and I've been reading it. It's unbelievable. Do you have it in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1973.1s	1973.1	 front of you, Jason? I do. I'll just give you the Chamath's tweet here, high level. 28% of purchases
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1978.3s	1978.3	 on Amazon are completed in less than three minutes. I think we've all done that. 50% of purchase is on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1984.9s	1984.9	 Amazon are completed in less than 15. And if you actually look at that, and I think this is a really,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1990.4s	1990.4	 I don't know if you made this calculation. No, this is Bezos wrote it in the letter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=1993.4s	1993.4	 All of these things. So if you value your time at $10 an hour, a very low one, that's $750 a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2000.9s	2000.9	 And that means your prime is free of $120 a year. So let me say it differently. The average trip to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2009.7s	2009.7	 the store, driving, buying, coming back is an hour. So what Bezos said is that typically we will save
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2015.9s	2015.9	 you 75 hours because we can make all of that more efficient for you. At $10 an hour, that's worth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2021.4s	2021.4	 $750. We only charge you $120 for prime, which means you get $630 of savings. But then he goes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2029.5s	2029.5	 on to say, and we have 200 million customers on prime, so we're saving them $126 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2036.4s	2036.4	 My instant reaction was two things. And so the last two points in that tweet are mine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2041.1s	2041.1	 One is, holy fuck, that's more in one year than what most companies are worth in their entire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2045.5s	2045.5	 lifetime. And the second is that you can buy Amazon for 13 times one year's worth of savings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2051.6s	2051.6	 for a customer. It's just if you look at prime, which makes Amazon seem exceptionally cheap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2056.6s	2056.6	 But the reason I brought up Amazon is he also wrote in there about his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2059.9s	2059.9	 responsibility to his employees. And we were just talking about employees and churn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2064.2s	2064.2	 And this was incredible to me that 70% of their employees voted down the unionization effort
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2069.7s	2069.7	 in Alabama. And I just wanted to get saxipoo, red pill it, crush it, snort it. What do you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2075.3s	2075.3	 got to say? Yeah. Well, I mean, what happened is you had in Alabama, there's a Amazon plant there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2085.0s	2085.0	 where there basically was an election to decide whether they would go union or not. And there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2090.5s	2090.5	 were 2,536 workers who voted in this union election. About 1,800 voted against unionization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2099.1s	2099.1	 versus 738 who voted to unionize. And then ballots from another 505 workers were either
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2105.9s	2105.9	 were challenged by either Amazon or the union. So we don't know yet what they mean. But those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2111.2s	2111.2	 votes won't change the outcomes. The election is over. Now, this was a heavily lobbied election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2116.7s	2116.7	 I mean, Amazon was lobbying employees, but so were the unions. And it looks like the unions at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2122.2s	2122.2	 end of the day or lost and the employees voted to remain unionless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2128.6s	2128.6	 Brad, what do you think? I thought it was a beautiful defense of capitalism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2133.0s	2133.0	 that's very much needed right now. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2137.8s	2137.8	 It reminded me a lot, frankly, of the Gates Foundation annual letter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2143.2s	2143.2	 where Bill Gates is saying capitalism is far from perfect, but it's resulted in the most important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2149.2s	2149.2	 era of prosperity and health and wellness in the history of the planet. And as I said on CNBC this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2156.1s	2156.1	 week, we live in a moment where capitalism is absolutely under attack. And I truly believe it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2164.1s	2164.1	 the greatest force, the greatest potential force for good in the world. It brought us a vaccine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2171.4s	2171.4	 it brings us innovation that pulls people out of poverty, that makes people healthier,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2176.7s	2176.7	 that gives an opportunity for people in rural areas that are impoverished to be educated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2182.9s	2182.9	 But I do think it's incumbent upon Bezos. I think this was very much a robber baron sort of defense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2190.2s	2190.2	 of building railroads. And I thought it was brilliant in its execution, but I think it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2197.0s	2197.0	 important for all of us to stand up, not defensively, but to say, what are our obligations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2203.8s	2203.8	 to make capitalism the greatest force for good? You know, Chamath, whether it's you and I talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2208.8s	2208.8	 about invest America on CNBC and giving every child in this country, a participation in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2214.8s	2214.8	 ownership society, right, right, or all the other initiatives that we need to work on today, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2220.1s	2220.1	 know, to, to make the case, we need to make it better. And I think one of the issues here is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2224.6s	2224.6	 you know, what we see on Twitter being part of the Twitter oddity is, you know, people who are super
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2230.3s	2230.3	 woke, socialist, whatever, talking about this, but in reality, the workers don't want it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2235.7s	2235.7	 And I was talking to somebody in the media. No, no, hold on. Can I just say something slightly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2239.7s	2239.7	 different, Jason? I think what workers don't want is the version 1.0 of unions, okay, because I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2247.8s	2247.8	 what they see that as is a tax that then goes and fills the coffers of certain people. I think you've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2255.8s	2255.8	 seen like, you know, a bunch of waste, a bunch of graft, a bunch of corruption, people have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2260.8s	2260.8	 arrested. Unions are not effective anymore in collective bargaining. They are not. They don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2266.2s	2266.2	 have any data. They don't have any facts. They're not, they're not power, but they're not set up to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2271.4s	2271.4	 win. So I think, in my opinion, I think unions have an important role, but you need a version 2.0. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2278.6s	2278.6	 need some young, smart, bright people to reframe what unions are. And then I think you would see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2284.2s	2284.2	 everybody collectively organized, which is it's not about dues. You don't need hundreds of millions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2289.8s	2289.8	 of dollars to all of a sudden like use to then elect certain people. And that old model is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2295.7s	2295.7	 breaking. It's breaking every day. Instead, I think what people need to do is like, if you come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2299.9s	2299.9	 together and like you understand what are the products we make, what are the margins we have,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2304.2s	2304.2	 how is my contribution measured? You know, and then you're able to use data and fact to really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2308.9s	2308.9	 collectively bargain. That hasn't happened yet. So I think what it was was a-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2312.6s	2312.6	 Or it could be a free market and people could go work at Starbucks or for Postmates and get paid more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2319.0s	2319.0	 Capitalism allows both to exist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2321.4s	2321.4	 If you think about what a union is, you could almost make an argument that it is the ultimate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2327.0s	2327.0	 manifestation of a free market system, because it is basically like a bunch of people spinning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2331.8s	2331.8	 out to have their own startup. And so, you know, that group of people are saying we're not charging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2336.7s	2336.7	 enough for our product or service today, the value that we are creating is worth more. Therefore,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2341.7s	2341.7	 we should go create a, you know, a different business and charge more and effectively compete
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2346.4s	2346.4	 in the marketplace with a higher quality product at a higher price point. And I think that that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2351.9s	2351.9	 may be kind of, you know, the distinction between what people kind of view to be regulatory capture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2356.9s	2356.9	 around unions where there has been government involvement in the past versus what may be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2361.2s	2361.2	 possible. I think I've heard some people talk about how, you know, at some point in the world,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2365.0s	2365.0	 we end up with, you know, at some point in the evolution of capitalism, you end up in a place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2368.1s	2368.1	 where there are no employees, there's just a ton of independent contractors doing independent work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2372.3s	2372.3	 And maybe there is an organization of people around doing the same work over and over together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2376.1s	2376.1	 as a group, where you charge one kind of, you know, aggregated fixed rate for that service.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2382.1s	2382.1	 The other thing to me was like, all of a sudden, it brought into such a stark contrast, this wasn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2386.2s	2386.2	 like 5545. This was 7030. Probably it could have been 8020 or 9010. And so it said to me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2394.2s	2394.2	 wait a minute, there's a very small vocal group of people who are screaming for the mountaintops
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2399.0s	2399.0	 about this level of unionization and organization. And then the people that are actually the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2405.1s	2405.1	 participants of that system are like, No, thank you. Yeah, well, I mean, it shows that Amazon does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2409.5s	2409.5	 a great job managing, right? I mean, they create enough value, and they've been enough for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2413.4s	2413.4	 service that people don't feel like they're being underbid. Media companies have been going through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2417.2s	2417.2	 a unionization process from Gawker to Vox, the New York Times has already had one. And you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2422.5s	2422.5	 starting to see a bunch of folks voting on that. I was speaking to somebody who runs one of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2427.0s	2427.0	 companies. And they said, the in the short term, it's fabulous, because they set the prices of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2435.0s	2435.0	 employees. So when somebody comes to you and says, I want to raise, they say, well, we can't,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2438.8s	2438.8	 because here's the pay scale that you negotiated. So we have to stick to that. And I can't give you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2442.9s	2442.9	 more than other people, because one of the things you fought for as a union was pay parity. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2448.6s	2448.6	 you've got five years, here's what it says on the chart, five years, so it made everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2452.0s	2452.0	 predictable. And they said they like that they said the problem is, over the long term, when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2456.8s	2456.8	 get to year 10 of a union, in order to fire somebody who's not doing a great job, you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2462.2s	2462.2	 to negotiate with the union that they have to get all these warnings, and it's uncomfortable. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2466.2s	2466.2	 then the managers don't do the performance plans, they don't do that. And then eventually,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2471.1s	2471.1	 who's left in the organization, the lower performers, and then who leaves the higher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2476.3s	2476.3	 performers who can command more money. So once you get this union thing going inside of a media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2481.4s	2481.4	 company, in the short term, it controls costs in the long term, it kills excellence. This was what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2486.7s	2486.7	 somebody told me. Have you guys seen the movie American Factory? I think this was on Netflix,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2492.8s	2492.8	 it was actually created by it was the first film produced by Barack and Michelle Obama's production
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2499.6s	2499.6	 company. But it's a very interesting film about there's a Chinese billionaire who goes to kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2507.6s	2507.6	 of the Rust Belt to out so a little city outside Dayton, Ohio. And there's and basically opens a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2515.8s	2515.8	 factory producing glass windshields for cars. And this factory had been shut down, the whole town
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2522.1s	2522.1	 was kind of out of work. They were kind of down and down in the dumps. And so this crazy Chinese
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2527.6s	2527.6	 billionaire comes in there and reopens the factory. And all he will and it creates like 2000 jobs for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2534.7s	2534.7	 people in this town. And everything starts off great. There's these really interesting sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2539.8s	2539.8	 culture clashes between the American workers and the Chinese executives and some of its kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2544.8s	2544.8	 comical and they showed in the movie. But then about halfway through the movie and by the way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2549.7s	2549.7	 these are people who are out of work. And this Chinese company comes in, they do things kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2554.9s	2554.9	 their way, but they pay people pretty well, and creating a lot of jobs. And initially, everybody's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2559.4s	2559.4	 very happy with it. And the politicians are all encouraging it. And then about halfway through the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2563.5s	2563.5	 movie, the unions come in. And the unions start agitating and they start telling all the workers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2569.3s	2569.3	 that you're underpaid, you're mistreated. They start, you know, there's sort of intimidation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2576.0s	2576.0	 tactics being used. And then the politicians come in. And you know, these politicians are sort of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2581.6s	2581.6	 you know, this is Ohio, right? And so the politicians start telling the workers at this plant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2587.1s	2587.1	 that they should get unionized. And it turns into this giant battle because and the Chinese company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2593.0s	2593.0	 basically threatens to leave because they came into this town and made something like a $500 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2599.3s	2599.3	 investment in this plant based on an understanding of a certain cost structure. And now all of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2605.6s	2605.6	 sudden, the union wants to change that. And you know, it turns into this giant conflict. And you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2610.7s	2610.7	 realize that look, that workers in this town had a good deal. And then the unions are about to like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2616.3s	2616.3	 blow the whole thing and wreck it and they're about to drive this Chinese company out of the town.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2622.9s	2622.9	 And then they do this election kind of like what Amazon did. And ultimately, the Chinese company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2627.4s	2627.4	 wins and the voters choose not to go with the union. But you just feel like you can it's just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2632.5s	2632.5	 so frustrating to see this. Because it's it's not like the this particular union is benefiting the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2639.3s	2639.3	 workers. It's about benefiting these union representatives. And paying off the politicians,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2646.3s	2646.3	 which gets back to our discussion in your little speech for your governoral run,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2650.7s	2650.7	 that you're going to fire all the teachers come September 1, if they don't show up for work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2654.2s	2654.2	 No, but look, it's really it's a really interesting movie, because I think what it does is highlights
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2660.4s	2660.4	 that what's in the interest of these labor union leaders is not necessarily what's in the interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2665.4s	2665.4	 of the employees. Anybody want to know this guys look, that this is like the simplest form
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2670.3s	2670.3	 of incentives to understand you pay dues as a union member, those revenues get allocated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2676.0s	2676.0	 and controlled by a handful of people in union leadership. So this is this shouldn't be a surprise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2681.2s	2681.2	 that their incentives get misaligned, especially when you go from a small effective union to a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2686.6s	2686.6	 broad, you know, union that represents all kinds of different workers, it's an impossible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2690.9s	2690.9	 infrastructure to manage. And it becomes unwieldy unions can be effective. There is a value in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2697.5s	2697.5	 place for them, they need to get reinvented. By the way, I looked this up, you know, the average
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2702.3s	2702.3	 wage, the average fee is to be in a union across all unions in the United States as a percent of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2706.8s	2706.8	 labor. Anyone got to guess? One and a half percent. Yeah, I said two. Yeah. So the argument is if they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2714.7s	2714.7	 can increase wages net to those employees by more than one and a half percent, it pays for itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2720.2s	2720.2	 Right. That's the argument. So incentive. They totally get it. They are a startup in and of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2725.1s	2725.1	 themselves. They are an asset manager, right? Their goal is to grow assets. Yeah. So the more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2731.0s	2731.0	 assets they grow, you know, the bigger their business. The way in which, you know, relating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2737.8s	2737.8	 this back to Bezos's annual letter, right? We've been presented this false choice for two decades
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2745.1s	2745.1	 between some form of Anne Randian capitalism and a nanny state, right? Right. Right. Either everything's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2752.8s	2752.8	 unionized, or we have no intervention at all. What I love about this moment in time, what I love about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2759.7s	2759.7	 the leadership of Benioff or Bezos or Gates, or even Anthony Tan, this incredible mission,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2766.1s	2766.1	 values driven leader who's using the power of capitalism to uplift tens of millions of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2770.9s	2770.9	 in Southeast Asia, is that I see a totally new generation of leaders that understand the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2778.1s	2778.1	 responsibility. Like they're charting the middle way, right? And we can equally reject Lorena
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2783.8s	2783.8	 Gonzalez, right? And at the same time, worse want to have $15 minimum wage in the state of California,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2790.7s	2790.7	 like those two things are mutually compatible. And so that's why Sachs has to run. He's got to chart
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2797.8s	2797.8	 the third way. Let me ask you this, Brad, would you put up 250 K for an exploratory fund, Brad?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2803.8s	2803.8	 Sachs, do you put, do you, do you believe in a $15 minimum wage? Oh, I'd be fine. I'd be fine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2809.3s	2809.3	 with it. It's not that that's not that's. Oh, it's on. He took a blue pill. He took a blue pill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2815.2s	2815.2	 Give everyone everything. Certainly in the state of California, I think that makes sense. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2819.4s	2819.4	 I think, look, there might be some parts of the country where the standard of living is much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2822.6s	2822.6	 cheaper. I mean, I think probably the minimum wage should be a state issue because there's such a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2827.4s	2827.4	 disparity in different costs of living in different states. So I'm not sure I'd federalize it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2832.2s	2832.2	 but I'm, but certainly in California, I think 15 bucks makes sense. What about 20 bucks, David?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2837.0s	2837.0	 20 bucks in California. Why not? Why not a thousand? Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2845.0s	2845.0	 Can everyone get a free Tesla? No, but can I make, can we make the point about unions in California?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2850.7s	2850.7	 I think there's a huge difference between private sector unions and public sector unions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2854.7s	2854.7	 So look, I'm not against collective bargaining when it comes to these private sector unions. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2860.3s	2860.3	 Because the workers do have, you know, these, these plants involve, can involve very tough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2866.4s	2866.4	 working conditions. It's physically dangerous. You know, they're, before there were labor reforms,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2872.2s	2872.2	 they were working really long insane hours or safety issues. Okay. I think it makes sense to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2876.6s	2876.6	 have some sort of collective bargaining and there's somebody to negotiate with. There's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2881.0s	2881.0	 management of the company has an incentive. And so you have some give and take and you have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2885.1s	2885.1	 negotiation. It produces an outcome. Public sector unions are completely different, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2890.2s	2890.2	 Because when the teachers union goes to negotiate, who are they negotiating with?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2894.2s	2894.2	 They're negotiating with Gavin Newsom and the teachers union is his biggest contributor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2900.0s	2900.0	 So who has an incentive to oppose their demands? There's no market. There's no market. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2906.3s	2906.3	 at a minimum takes a politician who has a lot of integrity to stand up to the teachers unions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2912.8s	2912.8	 because he did it in New York. Bloomberg did do it. By the way, by the way, this is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2917.4s	2917.4	 this is a true market dynamic for everything as it relates to government spending. If you think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2922.6s	2922.6	 about when, when the government says it's going to spend something on someone on something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2926.9s	2926.9	 legislation passes and it mandates that something needs to be bought. When that happens, there is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2932.1s	2932.1	 no negotiating power because there is no marketplace to achieve that objective. They have to spend the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2937.0s	2937.0	 money on the thing that they said they were going to spend it on. And at that point, there is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2940.8s	2940.8	 seller who sells that thing who says, oh shit, these guys have to buy it. I'll double the price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2945.8s	2945.8	 Okay, great. That's just the natural law of government inflation that happens. It's happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2950.2s	2950.2	 with everything that we've seen inflate in this country, education, healthcare, is all because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2954.8s	2954.8	 it's a government mandated service. And so then the service providers to the government have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2959.3s	2959.3	 single captive customer who has to spend the money. And so the same is true of education.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2964.2s	2964.2	 The government has to educate. Therefore, I can show up as an education union and say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2969.5s	2969.5	 I'm going to double my price to educate your people because you have to do it by law.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2973.2s	2973.2	 And you've passed all these laws that say you have to do it. And there is nothing the government can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2976.8s	2976.8	 do about it. And so, you know, I think it is worth highlighting that there the lack of a marketplace,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2982.0s	2982.0	 meaning if you were to negotiate with a company, let's say a company had to buy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2985.9s	2985.9	 productivity software for its employees, it could decide whether or not buying that productivity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2990.2s	2990.2	 software generated a positive return at the price point that the sellers are negotiating against
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2994.8s	2994.8	 them. And they could say, no, you know what, I'm not going to buy it. Everything's too expensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=2997.8s	2997.8	 I'm going to go find another way. The problem is governments are mandated to spend that money on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3001.8s	3001.8	 that particular service. And therefore, there is no room. And so unions are a manifestation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3006.6s	3006.6	 of this fundamental problem with giving governments large budgets and relying on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3011.0s	3011.0	 government to provide the service to us outside of a market driven context. So I think the question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3015.6s	3015.6	 really is can healthcare can education can these things that have been inflated with the government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3019.7s	3019.7	 having such an active role be provided in a way that the government facilitates their provisioning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3025.0s	3025.0	 without the government being the customer? This is a good jumping off point to one very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3029.8s	3029.8	 to the next then topic. There's a bunch of things happening in government that I just want to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3034.2s	3034.2	 your guys's reaction to one, which was the crazy summary that somebody did about the reaction to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3041.7s	3041.7	 Biden pulling out of Afghanistan. Okay. The second is unfortunately, Biden reiterated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3048.6s	3048.6	 Trump's decision on refugee numbers just today. So he's not, he had a pledge that he would,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3055.8s	3055.8	 you know, go back to the original numbers, the Obama level numbers. And he said he's not going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3061.2s	3061.2	 to, he's going to keep it at the Trump level, which basically says, you know, very nominal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3064.7s	3064.7	 refugees. And then the third is the growing frustration and perceived incompetence of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3070.8s	3070.8	 CDC. And now you have the entire business community starting to push back. Those are three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3075.8s	3075.8	 completely different things, but they just speak about some government things. I'm curious about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3079.0s	3079.0	 your reactions to anybody. Well, I mean, the thing that that highlights for me is the media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3084.1s	3084.1	 double standard. And I think this is why a lot of people are going to centrism and why this podcast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3089.3s	3089.3	 has become a purple podcast and a rational podcast, because AOC was going down to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3094.6s	3094.6	 border hysterical crying. You remember the photos, they were all dressed in white. And is there any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3099.4s	3099.4	 difference between what Trump did at the border and what's happening now? Doesn't feel like it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3103.5s	3103.5	 feels like it's a problem that they're both trying to solve. And it's 90% the same outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3107.6s	3107.6	 And then you look at Afghanistan, you know, Trump's like, we got to get out of here. And then the press
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3111.5s	3111.5	 dunks on him, like, how could you do that? And now Biden's doing and he's getting high fives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3115.7s	3115.7	 And so I would just like to see some consistency from the press and the reaction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3119.8s	3119.8	 and Americans on these issues, which seem to be non winnable or, you know, how much do you lose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3127.4s	3127.4	 in these instances? Afghanistan's a lose lose and the border is a lose lose. Like there's there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3133.0s	3133.0	 no winning I don't think in these in some of the in some situations that a president has to face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3137.0s	3137.0	 I'm interested in what Sachs has to say. Well, yeah, I saw that I saw that tweet storm on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3141.2s	3141.2	 media double standard around Afghanistan, we should show that and link to it in the show notes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3145.5s	3145.5	 because whoever it was incredible, it's incredible. This is like definitive proof of the media double
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3152.8s	3152.8	 standard where he goes literally, he does a side by side of every single major prestige media outlet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3159.1s	3159.1	 their coverage on Trump versus Biden's drawdown in Afghanistan. You know, Trump, Trump did the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3164.7s	3164.7	 major drawdown and I think got us down to maybe like 1500 troops there. I think he missed a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3169.9s	3169.9	 political opportunity not to just go all the way down to zero, then he could have taken credit for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3173.8s	3173.8	 ending the war, which I think he wanted to do for whatever reason, he didn't get it done. And he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3178.9s	3178.9	 basically handed Biden a beautiful opportunity just to kind of end the war once and for all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3182.7s	3182.7	 I think it's very popular. People are we've been there for 20 years, I think people want to get out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3187.1s	3187.1	 So I think Biden's decision was politically correct. And I think it was the right decision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3193.0s	3193.0	 as well. I think we've it's time to be out of there. But yeah, the coverage in the press was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3198.6s	3198.6	 just completely hysterical about Trump doing it. It was predicting all sorts of negative consequences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3203.7s	3203.7	 And then when Biden did it, like Jason saying, it was nothing but kudos. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3208.2s	3208.2	 well, not only is a press not objective and not impartial, but they change their mind about a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3216.2s	3216.2	 particular issue based on which team is doing it. Yeah, I mean, if you look at the two quotes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3221.3s	3221.3	 they have a CNN tweet that they just screen grabbed CNN on the same issue says this is reckless,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3226.8s	3226.8	 and it's really risky of Trump's plan to withdraw troops. And then the next CNN tweet from this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3233.0s	3233.0	 administration, President Obama praised President Biden's bold leadership to withdraw from Afghanistan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3237.9s	3237.9	 Afghanistan by September 11. And there's dozens of these NPR, CNN, New York Times, Washington.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3244.1s	3244.1	 And over again, and then I think this is why Americans hate the media.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3247.9s	3247.9	 Absolutely. I mean, this is the you know, what the what the conservatives I would call the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3252.9s	3252.9	 mainstream media, you know, MSN, I mean, but they are proving their bias right here. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3257.5s	3257.5	 and they're increasing irrelevance. This is why the American public don't trust them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3261.0s	3261.0	 don't listen to them, and don't care what they have to say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3263.8s	3263.8	 Brad, what do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3264.9s	3264.9	 Well, I wanted to, you know, at a federal level, we really can't opt out of any of this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3270.6s	3270.6	 right? We're not going to leave the country. We got an election every four years. So we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3274.6s	3274.6	 just talking about market failures in the state of California. And one of the most beautiful designs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3279.8s	3279.8	 of our system of federalism, back to this idea of markets, right, is the fact that you get to choose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3286.8s	3286.8	 what state you want to live in. And in a post COVID world, we have the greatest AB testing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3295.2s	3295.2	 in the history of federalism. Because now you can live and work from anywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3301.8s	3301.8	 And the differences between state policies have never been greater.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3306.4s	3306.4	 And so we've never had this incubation that we can all watch and live tweet about on Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3313.4s	3313.4	 And so now Texas and Florida, they get to make choices, California gets to make its choices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3319.0s	3319.0	 And then we get to see, and political scientists are going to have a field day in five to 10 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3326.2s	3326.2	 And people are voting with their wallet today, the AB test in real time, we have the largest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3331.1s	3331.1	 economic migration in the history of this country, occurring right now. And Gavin Newsom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3337.8s	3337.8	 and Lorena Gonzalez, they're going to have to be held accountable for the conditions in San Francisco
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3344.6s	3344.6	 for the decisions with respect to companies leaving the state, people leaving the state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3349.0s	3349.0	 And frankly, it's not about lower taxes. I would contend the even bigger issue is the contempt for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3356.3s	3356.3	 capitalism, the contempt for entrepreneurialism and innovation that exists in California. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3362.6s	3362.6	 have no intention to leave, but I will tell you this, like, I'm going to fight like hell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3368.0s	3368.0	 for a third way, right? That actually says capitalism can be a force for good in California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3374.6s	3374.6	 And that's why Sachs needs to run.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3376.2s	3376.2	 And Sachs is in Miami.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3379.1s	3379.1	 I love this idea of a state by state AB test. I mean, what was the old line I get? It was FDR's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3385.8s	3385.8	 line that federalism is the laboratory, the state's the laboratory of democracy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3390.4s	3390.4	 Yeah, great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3391.0s	3391.0	 So I want to show this, I just posted a link in the chat of COVID death rates in the US by state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3397.3s	3397.3	 And it's really remarkable because every state has very, has, we've seen a lot of very different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3401.7s	3401.7	 COVID policies by state. What we see is that California and Florida have almost the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3407.1s	3407.1	 death rate. I think California is like 154 per 10,000 and Florida is like 159. It's a very,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3413.4s	3413.4	 very small gap. Despite the fact that California has had the longest and most severe lockdowns in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3418.6s	3418.6	 the country and Florida has been the most open. And then meanwhile, you look at states like Michigan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3425.7s	3425.7	 which has also had very severe lockdowns and has had a much higher death rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3429.8s	3429.8	 And so you see that there's really no correlation between death rates for COVID per capita and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3437.9s	3437.9	 severity of lockdowns. Basically, the data shows that lockdowns don't have an impact on a state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3443.8s	3443.8	 success in battling COVID. And it's just remarkable that we still are, despite this data, despite the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3451.8s	3451.8	 fact that science is now showing us, we still have lockdowns in the state of California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3458.2s	3458.2	 We've loosened up a little bit, but we're still talking about orange tears. And it's just, and I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3464.0s	3464.0	 here in Florida right now. It's open. It's open. And, you know, Florida has a lot more old people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3471.0s	3471.0	 than California. And the death rate is just about the same as California. So it's just remarkable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3477.0s	3477.0	 to me that we are stuck in this mentality of lockdown. And I think it's because Newsom has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3483.8s	3483.8	 bought into this savior myth that he has. I think he's remembering all this press that he and Cuomo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3489.2s	3489.2	 got at the beginning of COVID about what great saviors they were and how they protected the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3493.8s	3493.8	 population from COVID. But it's also been compounded by federal failure because the CDC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3500.6s	3500.6	 basically said, or not said, they revealed themselves to be incompetent. You know, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3505.7s	3505.7	 same person that we all thought was an incredible genius, Fauci, increasingly looks like somewhat of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3512.1s	3512.1	 an idiot and, you know, not completely informed on the topics that he should be informed about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3517.4s	3517.4	 And then, you know, you have these federal agencies. So, for example, when you put the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3521.4s	3521.4	 CDC and the FDA together, some of their decisions are just complete head scratchers. Like, for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3526.0s	3526.0	 example, this past week, you know, the FDA stopped the use of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3531.9s	3531.9	 seven women between the ages of 18 and 48 got a blood clot and one passed away. And if you think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3538.6s	3538.6	 of over 7 million doses, right? And so it's literally one in 7 million for fatality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3545.8s	3545.8	 Right. And actually, here's the crazy thing about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3548.9s	3548.9	 More people died in car accidents on the way to getting those vaccinations and actually died
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3552.9s	3552.9	 from a blood clot. And so- More enlightening strikes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3555.6s	3555.6	 More enlightening strikes. So it's bad risk assessment, but it's also been very bad PR
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3561.0s	3561.0	 for the vaccine. So in the wake of that, the polling on vaccines went down by like 15 points.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3567.4s	3567.4	 And so they're scaring people away from getting vaccines. I don't know if that polling was just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3571.1s	3571.1	 on J&J or whether it applies to other vaccines as well. But the most important thing that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3576.8s	3576.8	 health officials could do is just convince people to get vaccinated. And the decision they made on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3582.5s	3582.5	 rolling back J&J has really hurt that. And then also this, you know, the Fauci comments that even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3588.0s	3588.0	 if you're vaccinated, you can't go to movies, you can't go to sporting events, you still have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3592.3s	3592.3	 wear a mask, you still can't, you know, get together in groups and indoor spaces. Well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3596.3s	3596.3	 then why would you get vaccinated? Why would you take that chance?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3598.6s	3598.6	 That is so critical. Friedberg, do you think if you get a vaccine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3601.9s	3601.9	 you should be allowed to take the mask off? Like that could be a reward?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3604.6s	3604.6	 Look, I mean, it's a bigger question than the science question, right? But I certainly don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3610.2s	3610.2	 think that there's any risk to you or people around you once you've been vaccinated with respect to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3615.0s	3615.0	 your wearing a mask. And so, you know, the mask mandate, I think, as you guys pointed out, is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3621.1s	3621.1	 little bit more kind of political and social posturing than it is kind of, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3626.2s	3626.2	 scientifically reducing the spread of the virus once you've been vaccinated. Once you've been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3632.0s	3632.0	 vaccinated, you're in the clear, theoretically can do what you want to do. Of course. So, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3637.6s	3637.6	 let's just be really clear. Once you get vaccinated, there's no reason to wear a mask. Remember,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3642.1s	3642.1	 the reason for the mask mandates was source control, right? That's right. To prevent other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3647.4s	3647.4	 people from getting the virus. Well, if you're not carrying the virus and you're not admitting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3651.0s	3651.0	 the virus, there's no need for you to wear a mask. And to insist that people wear a mask
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3657.2s	3657.2	 after they've been vaccinated is performatively anti-vax because you're sending the message
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3662.5s	3662.5	 that the vaccines can't be trusted. You agree with that, Friedberg?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3667.1s	3667.1	 Yeah, it's a fair point. I totally, I mean, I think it's a really fair point. And,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3670.8s	3670.8	 um, uh, and, you know, the, the, the whole counter argument to that, which is counterfactual is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3676.7s	3676.7	 you know, Hey, you know, you can still transmit the virus. We don't know that you can't transmit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3680.3s	3680.3	 the virus, but you know, you could theoretically say that about anything we know deterministically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3685.4s	3685.4	 We don't have empirical evidence that we can say statistically, here's how likely you are to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3688.8s	3688.8	 transfer the virus, but we know deterministically, this is the process by which a vaccine works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3693.0s	3693.0	 You're not going to be having replicating virus viral loads in your body. Therefore,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3697.2s	3697.2	 you're not going to have a high viral load coming out of your nasal passages of your mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3700.5s	3700.5	 Therefore, you know, and this is the case with all these kinds of vaccines, like the flu,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3705.4s	3705.4	 we, you know, you shouldn't be needing to have to wear a mask. So like, um, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3710.6s	3710.6	 totally makes sense. And what's the upper bound Friedberg of the number of people that are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3714.5s	3714.5	 that are going to get vaccinated in the U S are we going to get to 60%?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3717.8s	3717.8	 I think 60% probably. Yeah. I would guess 60, 60, 65%. I mean, cause remember what percent of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3724.2s	3724.2	 uh, people under 16, 20%, I think, is that right? Yeah. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3728.0s	3728.0	 I think we've really, we've really, we've really botched this. I think we've totally botched this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3732.2s	3732.2	 vaccine rollout. I will tell you because of the upper bound being where it is, I still think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3738.0s	3738.0	 we'll end up at a point where we're going to have a lot of people, um, that are going to be immune
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3742.3s	3742.3	 because they already had COVID coupled with the vaccine. We're going to have extremely low numbers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3747.1s	3747.1	 but the reality is the numbers are not going to get to zero. And we talked about zeroism a couple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3751.2s	3751.2	 podcasts ago because we're not going to get to zero. I think this is a really important thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3755.4s	3755.4	 to remember the way that we've tuned ourselves to react to COVID. It was initially, remember it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3762.0s	3762.0	 initially about, you know, minimize the surge and by minimizing the surge, we will keep the healthcare
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3766.8s	3766.8	 system from being overwhelmed. Now we've transitioned into the, we can't let COVID spread,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3772.1s	3772.1	 but as we've seen, the reality is cannot stop COVID from spreading. No matter how many lockdowns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3776.5s	3776.5	 you put in place, it's idly people still get together in their homes and they'll give each
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3779.8s	3779.8	 other COVID. And because some number of people will continue to have COVID, we're going to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3784.0s	3784.0	 COVID in the United States for years to come. It is not going to go to zero. And the question we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3789.9s	3789.9	 have to ask ourselves is how are we going to allow ourselves to operate? How are we going to live
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3793.7s	3793.7	 our lives if the COVID risk is non-zero and it will always be non-zero. And by the way, the measles
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3798.9s	3798.9	 risk is non-zero. The chickenpox risk is non-zero. There are already non-zero, um, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3804.4s	3804.4	 transmissible, um, infectious diseases out there that have some degree of fatality rate to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3809.6s	3809.6	 But, um, I think the biggest thing we should all be concerned about is this notion that we are like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3813.8s	3813.8	 shifting into a new normal that will last for many years because we will never be at zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3818.6s	3818.6	 So can I, can I just add to this? I'm moving out of California if that's the case. I'm literally going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3822.6s	3822.6	 Texas. There will be mutinies. There will be mutinies. I'm done. I got my vaccine. I'm done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3827.3s	3827.3	 People, people that nobody's going to stand for that. Um, we already see it, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3831.9s	3831.9	 Chesky went on CNBC this morning and, you know, basically said, you know, they are battening down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3838.2s	3838.2	 all the hatches because there's no, like the demand for travel is literally going to blow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3844.0s	3844.0	 the roof off the building. Totally. Right. Like people, people are over too smart. People make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3849.7s	3849.7	 risk reward decisions in their personal lives every day. And if the government tries to lock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3854.8s	3854.8	 them down, they're going to tear down the gates. Like it's not going to happen. But what, what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3859.1s	3859.1	 you're saying though, is that what the implicit thing about what you're saying, which is scary is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3863.4s	3863.4	 unlike times before about measles or chickenpox, you, we now are basically debasing the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3869.4s	3869.4	 credibility that these government institutions have about anything they say. That's the real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3873.8s	3873.8	 enemy in the room. And this is all said and done. So now you have people that are acting on their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3878.0s	3878.0	 own. So the CDC says you can't fill the middle seat. The airlines say, no, go fuck yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3883.4s	3883.4	 We're going to fill whatever seat we want. And nobody's going to complain back to what Brad said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3887.4s	3887.4	 because they're risk underwriting for themselves and saying, wait, you don't know what you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3891.4s	3891.4	 talking about anymore. And so where does it leave us? Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3895.1s	3895.1	 You know, one of the ways states, even democracies maintain power was information control. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3901.4s	3901.4	 Right. And there is no information control today anywhere. In fact, we have frictionless
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3906.6s	3906.6	 information, which means that by definition, I think there's greater chance for decentralization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3911.4s	3911.4	 I mean, remember, you know, the Arab Spring governments were overthrown on the basis of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3916.6s	3916.6	 Twitter. Right. I don't believe we live in a Hobbesian state, you know, of suffering in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3923.0s	3923.0	 the natural order of things. Right. But I certainly believe that government has a role to play to help
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3928.5s	3928.5	 organize us. And, you know, because there are big issues that we face in the future. And, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3934.4s	3934.4	 I just hope we can find a balance, you know, in the path forward. But this, I think, Tramont, this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3941.8s	3941.8	 an inoculation, I think, to bad institutions. If you look at people who spent $250,000 going into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3949.5s	3949.5	 debt at some big, expensive college, these young folks are saying, I'm not going to do that anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3954.5s	3954.5	 Now those colleges have to react and change. And now we're seeing it with the teachers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3959.4s	3959.4	 But I think, Jason, it's actually more extreme than that. Like, we're learning that institutions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3964.1s	3964.1	 aren't reliable, number one. And then the second is that we're learning that those institutions are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3969.4s	3969.4	 static. So meaning, like today, there's, I think that there's a lot, there's a big case to be made,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3976.6s	3976.6	 that the CDC doesn't really know what they were doing. And that in some cases, the FDA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3984.0s	3984.0	 has been a little over reactive. Okay. Now, what can we do about these things? It's not like we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3989.8s	3989.8	 can have a new CDC that we all create and believe in or a new FDA. These are the laws of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3995.4s	3995.4	 government. Those laws won't change because there's a bunch of incentives for folks who are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=3999.7s	3999.7	 currently in power that oversee those things to remain that way. So now, exactly as Sac said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4006.6s	4006.6	 on the whim of frankly, like, maybe an overreaction, we pull vaccines off, then we pull them back on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4012.5s	4012.5	 then we pull them off. The reaction to the AstraZeneca vaccine was kind of a little awe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4017.9s	4017.9	 inspiring. Oh, it's bad. No, it's okay. Oh, it's good. No, it's bad. Take it off, take it on, put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4022.8s	4022.8	 it on. And that's been a global reaction. So you add all of these things up, I think the takeaway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4029.0s	4029.0	 is what Freeberg said, institutions are broken, because the incentives of the people that run them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4035.2s	4035.2	 are not aligned to the people that actually expect output from them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4038.6s	4038.6	 I'll say two things to this. That's an important point. One is institutions to me are like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4044.6s	4044.6	 any living organism, they want to grow. And so, you know, every government wants to add laws,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4050.4s	4050.4	 spend more money, grow its budget. Every company wants to have more power, grow its top line,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4055.2s	4055.2	 even every university. Harvard's endowment wants to grow over time, it wants to do more research,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4059.7s	4059.7	 it wants to have more classes, it wants to have the bigger campus. Every institution as a result
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4065.0s	4065.0	 is then trying to aggregate more resources and more power and more authority. And so, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4071.2s	4071.2	 then when you have these moments where the institution doesn't serve the stakeholders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4075.4s	4075.4	 that it is meant to serve, you have this breakdown of trust in the institution and institutional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4079.8s	4079.8	 fallout begins, whether that's the financial system and the evolution towards decentralized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4084.1s	4084.1	 finance and Bitcoin and so on, or the failure of government and the ignorance against laws and what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4089.0s	4089.0	 the government is telling us to do and so on, or in companies. And so, the big question for this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4095.0s	4095.0	 century is going to be, are we going to allow that to happen? Now, I mentioned this a few pods ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4099.3s	4099.3	 what I'm most concerned about is the absolute alternative to an institution is a mob rule.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4105.0s	4105.0	 And a mob rule, as we've seen, where you get cancel culture, and you get, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4109.6s	4109.6	 GameStop going through the roof, and you get trial before without a jury, and trial without a judge,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4118.4s	4118.4	 can be really ugly and can be really nasty. And so, the original intention of many of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4122.3s	4122.3	 institutions was to create a system by which there are rules and values that we all ascribe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4127.4s	4127.4	 to and those values go out the window when those institutions fail. So, the big challenge, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4133.3s	4133.3	 we as humanity are going to face this centuries, this dichotomy between the failure of institutions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4140.2s	4140.2	 and the need for institutions to constantly grow, versus the challenge of not having institutions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4144.5s	4144.5	 with respect to how do we operate societally with mob rule and distributed rule. And it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4149.8s	4149.8	 going to be interesting to kind of see, there's going to be a lot of back and forths over the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4153.5s	4153.5	 next couple of decades, I would imagine, with respect to how do we make economic, government,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4158.2s	4158.2	 and business decisions and how they play and whether institutions or kind of distributed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4163.6s	4163.6	 decision making plays a role. Good segue here to your pal, Josh Hawley, Halle Sachs. I never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4171.4s	4171.4	 thought I would see the day that a Republican wanted to bust all the big companies. But he says
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4178.9s	4178.9	 no acquisitions by companies with a market cap over 100 billion. Putting aside the fact that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4184.1s	4184.1	 this wasn't Elizabeth Warren, or Bernie Sanders proposing this, this was your bestie, your Josh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4190.8s	4190.8	 Hawley Sachs. Have you met him or donated to him? I haven't met him. I haven't met him. I think the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4196.6s	4196.6	 second question you make a little donation there to Holly. Maybe maybe one day we'll see, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4202.5s	4202.5	 what do you think about this concept? Two points. Okay, number one, you're right that this is showing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4209.0s	4209.0	 you know, there's a big political realignment underway. This legislation could have come from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4214.1s	4214.1	 Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders. I think they would have justified it in different ways. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4218.5s	4218.5	 what Hawley's concerned about is a concentration of power by big tech companies who are then using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4223.9s	4223.9	 that power to censor people. So that's kind of the impetus there. I think Sanders and Warren,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4228.8s	4228.8	 their impetus would be around more of a concentration of wealth and money and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4232.6s	4232.6	 power that that creates. So slightly different motivations, but I think they're probably on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4236.6s	4236.6	 same page here. It's kind of this populist wildfire that's kind of burning in both parties.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4243.0s	4243.0	 So I think that's sort of the first observation is kind of this new populist realignment of our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4248.2s	4248.2	 politics. The second point I'd make about this is that this legislation is what I would call
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4253.6s	4253.6	 sort of performative legislating. I mean, I don't think this bill is a serious proposal to become
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4260.0s	4260.0	 law. It's too much of a sledgehammer. I think that, you know, if the goal here is to try and rein in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4265.6s	4265.6	 big tech, I think just banning, you know, any acquisition by firms over $100 billion market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4271.4s	4271.4	 cap, it is way too much of a, it's just not, you know, it's just not crafted enough. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4278.2s	4278.2	 Is there any merit to it and how would you change it, Sachs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4280.6s	4280.6	 It would have tons of unintended consequences for, you know, what we do. I mean, we've talked about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4285.3s	4285.3	 this before. Wait, wait, isn't it good for what we do though? I mean, if companies stop selling early,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4288.7s	4288.7	 if Instagram and YouTube stayed independent, wouldn't this have been much better for the investors?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4293.5s	4293.5	 It was a blanket statement that said any company can't do it if they were over $100 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4299.3s	4299.3	 Right. So Berkshire Hathaway's business, boop, done, gone to zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4302.8s	4302.8	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4303.8s	4303.8	 It's too much of a blunt instrument. And look, even for us, right, there's only,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4308.2s	4308.2	 you know, three, I guess two or three good outcomes, right? There's IPOs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4311.2s	4311.2	 direct listeners, spats. Let's put them in the category of a company going public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4314.4s	4314.4	 Secondary sales, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4315.6s	4315.6	 Then there's M&A, okay? And then the third outcome is basically the company goes under,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4319.6s	4319.6	 it goes bankrupt, right? So if you take M&A off the table, you are basically denying a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4325.2s	4325.2	 of attractive exits for risk capital, and that's going to ultimately hurt the returns for risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4330.2s	4330.2	 capital and leads to less of it. There are a lot of companies where, you know, founders create a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4335.4s	4335.4	 technology that's valuable and interesting, but it can't monetize, and it needs to be part of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4339.9s	4339.9	 something larger. And if you deprive every, I guess, big company of being able to buy of R&D
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4346.0s	4346.0	 acquisitions, it's sort of crippling the economy for no reason. I don't think it really addresses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4351.9s	4351.9	 the issue that Holly really wants to address, which is censorship. So my point is I would find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4356.6s	4356.6	 a different way to address it. I think that at the end of the day, this legislation is not meant to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4361.8s	4361.8	 become law, it's meant to make a statement. Start the pot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4366.5s	4366.5	 To be a warning to big tech and to get, you know, and Holly's trying to appeal to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4371.6s	4371.6	 a constituency on his side of the aisle. And I think it's sort of-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4374.7s	4374.7	 It's disgusting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4375.9s	4375.9	 It's performative in that regard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4377.5s	4377.5	 I mean, Holly, like, he votes against the election. He comes out with this asinine solution to his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4384.4s	4384.4	 censorship beef. You know, like, this is the problem, the grandstanding of these politicians
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4390.9s	4390.9	 on both sides that aren't focused on, like, how do we make sure that everybody's participating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4397.4s	4397.4	 in the ownership society? How do we deal with, you know, issues of diversity? It's so far
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4404.8s	4404.8	 removed from actual pragmatic solutions to the real problems facing us that it just drives me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4411.5s	4411.5	 insane. And so he will most certainly not be getting a donation from our household.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4418.7s	4418.7	 And, you know, like, but what I am going to invest aggressively in, you know, and what I think we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4424.2s	4424.2	 ought to be doing, and I hope Chamath will take me up on this, right? I don't want to go spend 10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4430.2s	4430.2	 million in Washington to lobby them to create the Invest America account. Let's you and I put up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4435.8s	4435.8	 the money. Let's incubate this. Let's hire a CEO. Let's, you know, let's put up 10, 15 million bucks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4443.4s	4443.4	 Let's distribute it to families. 2,000 bucks at a pop. Let's build a proof of concept,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4447.5s	4447.5	 hire a great CEO. That's what we do and prove that it works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4451.8s	4451.8	 Yeah, that's better. That's actually a more practical giving pledge than the giving pledge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4456.7s	4456.7	 Oh my God. What a great idea, Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4459.6s	4459.6	 If we should just do that right now and basically name and shame everybody that doesn't want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4463.4s	4463.4	 contribute who's made money, because the reality is, we all have been extraordinarily lucky. Yes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4468.4s	4468.4	 we've worked hard. But frankly, you know, none of us deserve any of this. We've been lucky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4473.4s	4473.4	 And so whatever representative share that you could contribute and what it does, it gives,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4478.2s	4478.2	 you know, a low income person of color minority person in America, somebody who's, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4483.0s	4483.0	 disadvantaged, a $2,000 head start when they're born is a fucking amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4487.1s	4487.1	 We can raise $100 million in the next three months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4491.1s	4491.1	 Because do you know the reason people people are like, I don't want to pay taxes because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4494.3s	4494.3	 they don't believe government is going to use the money wisely. If we went out and told all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4499.5s	4499.5	 folks that we're going to use it to give $2,000 directly, right to create a sense of ownership
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4506.4s	4506.4	 and participation in the American dream, their little slice of Tesla, of Walmart, of Amazon,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4511.4s	4511.4	 of Google, like the money will come in from all the folks that you mentioned. And I would love
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4516.2s	4516.2	 to see this crew get on board with that. Yeah, I think we could do it over the course of the next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4519.8s	4519.8	 six months. I'm in let's do it. The audience who doesn't understand what we're talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4524.5s	4524.5	 Imagine we put $1,000 into a 401k or 2004 1k for an American, every American born, what would that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4533.7s	4533.7	 look like when they're 65 years old? And what if 500 of the 2000 was in a 529? What would that look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaU1P5-pzLU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=107&t=4539.2s	4539.2	 like when they're 18 years old, new at a college? So that was my little punch up to mouth is,
