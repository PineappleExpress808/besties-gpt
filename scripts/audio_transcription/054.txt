https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=0.0s	0.0	 My body is a wonderland.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3.4s	3.4	 If that wonderland is white, soft and mushy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=6.2s	6.2	 Sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=7.6s	7.6	 And hairy too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=11.4s	11.4	 You know, the worst thing about skin on skin sleeping with the newborn is that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=14.9s	14.9	 you know, sometimes she roots and she goes after the man, the male nip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=18.4s	18.4	 I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=18.8s	18.8	 Problem is my nipples covered in hair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=21.0s	21.0	 It's really awkward for everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=24.2s	24.2	 She start gagging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=25.4s	25.4	 I'll tell Tali that story when she's 18 or at her wedding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=28.1s	28.1	 It'll be even better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=30.6s	30.6	 Let your winners ride.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=46.3s	46.3	 Hey everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=47.0s	47.0	 Welcome to another episode of the All In Podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=50.7s	50.7	 I am wearing a blue shirt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=52.5s	52.5	 I am a pasty white old Greek man who's balding and obnoxious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=59.8s	59.8	 and with me today is...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=63.1s	63.1	 No, no, no, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=63.8s	63.8	 You have to say your pronoun, bro.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=65.5s	65.5	 And my pronouns are...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=69.4s	69.4	 Oh wait, hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=70.1s	70.1	 My pronouns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=70.6s	70.6	 My pronouns are beep, beep, and most people just call me a jerk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=75.8s	75.8	 With me today, of course, is my Sri Lankan, Urkel looking, wearing a furry sweater.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=82.5s	82.5	 Hello everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=83.3s	83.3	 My name is Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=84.6s	84.6	 I have salt and pepper, black hair, brown eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=88.6s	88.6	 I am tall, six foot two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=92.2s	92.2	 I go by the pronouns we, king, and stud muffin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=97.7s	97.7	 And I'm here to talk to you about internet security protocols.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=104.6s	104.6	 I look like Urkel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=105.8s	105.8	 I think people should just come up and say, well, I don't look like Urkel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=108.6s	108.6	 The closest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=109.4s	109.4	 I don't look like Urkel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=110.6s	110.6	 I look like a Bollywood movie star.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=111.5s	111.5	 When you put your glass...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=114.6s	114.6	 You're kind of like the Sri Lankan Urkel to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=116.6s	116.6	 Welcome to the All In Podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=118.3s	118.3	 Two out of the four of us are canceled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=119.8s	119.8	 Next up for cancellation, Sax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=123.0s	123.0	 Yes, I'm coming to you here from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, which was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=127.2s	127.2	 once land that belonged to the Mohegan, the Montauk, the Oneida, the Erie, and the Aracui tribes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=137.4s	137.4	 Since time immemorial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=140.8s	140.8	 You forgot the Irish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=142.5s	142.5	 We own the seven points.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=143.7s	143.7	 Oh my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=145.3s	145.3	 You really did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=146.6s	146.6	 You went for it, Sax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=147.8s	147.8	 I love you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=149.7s	149.7	 Isn't it important that we, at any moment that we're successful, we have to flagellate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=156.6s	156.6	 ourselves or remind ourselves that at one time all this land was owned by somebody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=163.7s	163.7	 We stole it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=164.8s	164.8	 Also, the Greeks conquered the Romans and so on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=167.6s	167.6	 I'd like to apologize for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=169.5s	169.5	 You forgot to mention you're also wearing a Brooks Brother shirt that is four sizes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=175.0s	175.0	 too large.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=177.0s	177.0	 This is my slim fit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=178.2s	178.2	 So that's slim fit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=179.7s	179.7	 Oh, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=180.2s	180.2	 Here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=180.7s	180.7	 Sax has been upgrading the wardrobe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=182.3s	182.3	 He's changed it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=182.9s	182.9	 Wait, wait, wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=183.8s	183.8	 Before Freebird does the intro, Jacob, you want to tell them why we're doing these intros
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=187.7s	187.7	 like this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=188.0s	188.0	 Yeah, I got to pause before we get.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=190.4s	190.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=190.7s	190.7	 Yesterday on the internet emerged a series of videos that were clipped of Microsoft
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=197.4s	197.4	 presenting their new suite of developer tools, yada, yada, and corporate people got up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=203.8s	203.8	 And without any explanation, started describing their physical appearance, their pronouns,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=210.6s	210.6	 their ethnicity, their skin tone, and their hairstyles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=215.6s	215.6	 And the entire internet was like, Oh, my God, this is crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=218.5s	218.5	 Woke ism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=219.0s	219.0	 Like, what what is happening here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=220.6s	220.6	 This?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=221.4s	221.4	 No, I thought it was a skit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=222.5s	222.5	 I thought it was a Saturday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=223.3s	223.3	 I just can't say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=224.2s	224.2	 And so then as soon as they got called out by the entire internet, they claimed that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=227.3s	227.3	 they were doing this for visually impaired people, which kind of begs the question of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=230.7s	230.7	 why visually impaired people need to know what race you are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=233.9s	233.9	 Like, it's still playing into this like crazy weight race consciousness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=238.5s	238.5	 But then on top of it, it wasn't just that we know it's not that because then they start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=242.6s	242.6	 doing this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=242.8s	242.8	 No, no, no, but hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=243.9s	243.9	 Also, if you if you're blind and technically can't see, you may not even know what blue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=248.0s	248.0	 means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=249.2s	249.2	 Because you will have never seen the color blue or blonde.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=252.2s	252.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=252.9s	252.9	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=253.1s	253.1	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=253.2s	253.2	 But they were also identifying their races, which kind of begs the question of why that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=256.6s	256.6	 important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=257.1s	257.1	 But if you were born blind, you would not know what that means either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=260.1s	260.1	 You're literally colorblind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=261.2s	261.2	 I think it's about putting you on the same footing as people who are not visually impaired.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=266.0s	266.0	 No, I'm saying if you're visually impaired, you're using the wrong language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=269.4s	269.4	 That language is for the sighted people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=272.4s	272.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=273.8s	273.8	 I'm just calling bullshit on their stated explanation that has anything to do with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=277.5s	277.5	 visually impaired because then they went on to basically recite the names of 10 tribes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=283.1s	283.1	 Native American tribes, and no one's ever heard of on which the Microsoft campus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=287.8s	287.8	 used to belong to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=288.8s	288.8	 So which is why I was kind of making fun of that in my initial statement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=292.4s	292.4	 But so look, this is just woke capitalism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=295.0s	295.0	 This is woke ism out of control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=297.8s	297.8	 Obviously, they didn't see the election results earlier in the week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=301.1s	301.1	 It's clearly there was some level of virtue signaling, I think, in their defense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=305.0s	305.0	 They were trying to do it, I think, for the visually impaired.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=307.9s	307.9	 The problem was they didn't explain the context and they didn't give instructions to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=312.6s	312.6	 people on what to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=313.6s	313.6	 So the people came out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=315.0s	315.0	 But Jake, how that video that was a clip pulled out of a broader context to write.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=319.0s	319.0	 So like, apparently, this is common on campus or common there that this is happening all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=323.2s	323.2	 over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=323.5s	323.5	 So we just saw common because I asked people online.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=326.9s	326.9	 Well, it was optional.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=327.8s	327.8	 It was optional.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=328.6s	328.6	 It's optional.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=329.2s	329.2	 Apparently, to the common point, I think the reason the internet reacted the way it was,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=332.3s	332.3	 was I asked every single person who came at me because the woke left came at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=336.6s	336.6	 I just said, Can you show me another clip of this on YouTube of any event where this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=340.7s	340.7	 occurred?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=341.1s	341.1	 And nobody could.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=342.2s	342.2	 So I think this was kind of a first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=344.1s	344.1	 When did you stop being a member of that woke left?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=346.5s	346.5	 Jake, how was the moment?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=348.6s	348.6	 I like the historical side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=349.9s	349.9	 I've never been for Bernie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=351.0s	351.0	 I've never been for Elizabeth Warren.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=352.1s	352.1	 I've always been moderate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=353.8s	353.8	 Wait, can I freeberg's intro?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=355.4s	355.4	 Yeah, freeberg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=355.9s	355.9	 Can we hear yours?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=358.2s	358.2	 My identity is an illusion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=360.5s	360.5	 It's an illusion created by the viewer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=363.0s	363.0	 And you can call me whatever you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=365.8s	365.8	 I sit on the ground where during the Haiti period, there was lava and magma and nothing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=371.5s	371.5	 but CO2 and methane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=373.2s	373.2	 And I represent those gases that are now lost to the oxygenation and the cyanobacteria
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=378.6s	378.6	 that swarmed over this earth and took everything over and led to the formation of eukaryotic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=383.5s	383.5	 life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=383.8s	383.8	 And here we all sit today, our privileged existence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=387.1s	387.1	 Are you saying that you want to freeberg is just electrons hitting neurons in interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=392.0s	392.0	 ways?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=392.2s	392.2	 Yeah, you know, he's like, he's like, it is his pronouns are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=395.5s	395.5	 His pronouns are proton and dark matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=399.1s	399.1	 Biochemical quantum bath, quantum foam is my pronoun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=404.2s	404.2	 So would you like to formally apologize for colonizing the dark matter during the Big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=409.5s	409.5	 Bang now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=410.4s	410.4	 Or would you like to have your more appropriate statement?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=414.5s	414.5	 It wasn't fair when the cyanobacteria took over the face of the earth and sucked up all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=419.2s	419.2	 the CO2 and created all the oxygen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=420.9s	420.9	 And for that, we all apologize.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=423.2s	423.2	 For the genocide of the genocide of CO2 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=429.0s	429.0	 methane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=429.5s	429.5	 I mean, those molecules were really happy and they had a very kind of like peaceful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=434.6s	434.6	 existence on this earth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=436.0s	436.0	 And, you know, cyanobacteria just took it all away from them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=441.3s	441.3	 And, you know, and then the offspring ended up being us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=444.7s	444.7	 And here we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=445.5s	445.5	 So apologies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=447.2s	447.2	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=448.6s	448.6	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=450.2s	450.2	 Welcome to episode 54.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=452.3s	452.3	 Everybody's canceled the final episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=454.6s	454.6	 Everybody's horrible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=455.7s	455.7	 I don't think that the Microsoft thing was bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=460.6s	460.6	 And when you hear the broader context, it was like, you know, that's just, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=463.8s	463.8	 I think it's a reasonable thing that visually impaired people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=467.5s	467.5	 I'm still long Microsoft and Google and short the rest of Big Tech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=470.2s	470.2	 So I'm fine with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=471.0s	471.0	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=471.8s	471.8	 Back to the stock price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=473.8s	473.8	 Jamal, do you think that the Google long Netflix short play is the right play?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=478.6s	478.6	 I think the best trade on the internet, the most obvious simple money making trade is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=482.6s	482.6	 long Microsoft, Google short Big Tech short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=485.0s	485.0	 The rest of the Big Tech short IBM, short Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=487.6s	487.6	 No, no, no, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=488.4s	488.4	 Short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=488.7s	488.7	 What I don't know, meaning you can, you can very comfortably short Apple, Facebook,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=492.6s	492.6	 Amazon, Netflix and be long Microsoft, Google.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=495.0s	495.0	 So as a spread trade, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=496.6s	496.6	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=497.1s	497.1	 It's the most it's the best risk parody trade on the internet right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=500.4s	500.4	 I mean, period in the markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=501.8s	501.8	 Can you explain explain a spreadsheet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=503.4s	503.4	 So look, look, I tweeted this a while ago, but it's like, and, and again, the, I think like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=509.1s	509.1	 Well, let me be constructive and say the people on Twitter that respond to these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=513.0s	513.0	 threads are not totally stupid, although I think they're kind of idiotic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=516.6s	516.6	 I said, you know, here's how you can effectively, you know, I said something about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=521.2s	521.2	 you know, Big Tech and I said, Oh, I can comfortably put my short on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=524.6s	524.6	 And I'm kind of trolling people when I do that, because I'm not telling them the full
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=528.6s	528.6	 trade and the real trade, whenever you put anything on, in my opinion, is all about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=533.0s	533.0	 managing risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=534.5s	534.5	 And the best thing about the internet and the stock market is that, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=538.6s	538.6	 when you're betting on internet stocks, you don't necessarily have to be naked, long or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=542.2s	542.2	 naked short, which comes with a lot more risk than if you were long one security and short
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=548.8s	548.8	 another against it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=549.8s	549.8	 So for example, over the last 10 years, you would have made a lot of money by being long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=554.6s	554.6	 Amazon and short a basket of traditional commerce companies, offline commerce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=560.8s	560.8	 I'm going to make up a basket, but Macy's, JC Penney, you know, Kmart Sears, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=565.9s	565.9	 So if you were short those and long Amazon, that's what's called a spread trade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=569.8s	569.8	 You're, you're basically playing the gap between your longs and your shorts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=574.7s	574.7	 It's independent of where the market generally trades.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=577.0s	577.0	 It's one of the relevant of the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=578.8s	578.8	 You're basically saying stocks could go up, but just not Amazon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=583.7s	583.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=585.1s	585.1	 When you put that trade on, for example, it's, I'm going to bet that if everything goes up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=590.2s	590.2	 Amazon will go up more than Kmart, Walmart, Sears.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=594.2s	594.2	 And if the stock market goes down, Amazon won't go down that much, but these ones will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=598.8s	598.8	 go down a lot and you're playing the spread.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=601.3s	601.3	 So just to be very explicit, you know, there was a very, and I talked about this last week,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=606.8s	606.8	 but I, that this idea wasn't mine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=608.9s	608.9	 It's a borrowed trade from somebody who's a very well known hedge fund manager who put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=613.0s	613.0	 it on in massive size.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=614.7s	614.7	 And, you know, to be honest, not knowing much of anything, I just copied it, but he's his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=619.6s	619.6	 initial trade was long Google short Facebook.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=625.6s	625.6	 And that trade basically was at parity, which meant that the long and the short canceled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=630.4s	630.4	 each other out for about the last four years until the last year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=634.9s	634.9	 It completely blew out and it returned about 80, 85%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=639.2s	639.2	 So if you had put a hundred dollars in, you would have made about 85, 85 bucks on this trade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=643.9s	643.9	 by being long Google short Facebook.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=646.0s	646.0	 The bigger trade at scale is actually long Google and Microsoft and short the rest of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=651.1s	651.1	 big tech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=651.8s	651.8	 And there's a lot of vagaries why that this idea makes a lot of sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=655.7s	655.7	 But what you're saying is they'll outperform the other basket of tech on a relative basis,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=659.8s	659.8	 on a relative basis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=660.6s	660.6	 So it's not like you're saying Airbnb can't go up or Facebook can't go up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=665.6s	665.6	 It could.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=666.1s	666.1	 It's not going to go as much as those other two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=668.6s	668.6	 He's saying that the trillion dollar market cap companies, not the Airbnbs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=673.3s	673.3	 Oh, OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=674.9s	674.9	 And the reason why focusing there makes sense is they're hyper liquid markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=681.0s	681.0	 They have tremendous ways in which you can have massive size on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=685.4s	685.4	 So you could put a trade of 10 billion long versus 10 billion short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=689.4s	689.4	 I mean, you can put mega size on on these things if you have real conviction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=695.0s	695.0	 And then the third thing is when the banks look at that kind of position, they actually,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=699.9s	699.9	 from a risk management perspective, treat it differently than if you were just naked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=704.0s	704.0	 long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=704.5s	704.5	 Any one of these things or make it long would be just making one bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=707.5s	707.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=707.8s	707.8	 Or, you know, or naked short, which is even more dangerous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=710.7s	710.7	 So if the market collapses by 30 percent, both stocks might go down 30 roughly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=717.1s	717.1	 but one will go down 32 and the other one will go down 28.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=719.8s	719.8	 And so you're really down to 2 percent as opposed to the 30 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=723.8s	723.8	 So all the market risk is taken out when you make trades like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=727.1s	727.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=727.8s	727.8	 The reason it's possible also today to do so at such a scale, right, Chamath,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=731.5s	731.5	 is interest rates are so low.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=733.7s	733.7	 So when you borrow on margin to go long, the rate is very low.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=737.1s	737.1	 And when you short the stock, if it's a highly liquid stock,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=739.5s	739.5	 it doesn't cost a lot to borrow to short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=741.7s	741.7	 That's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=742.0s	742.0	 So your actual carrying cost on that trade ends up being pretty low relative to the upside you expect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=749.4s	749.4	 So just to give you a sense of it, when I tweeted that tweet out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=753.5s	753.5	 to complete the picture, I was actually long something against my proposed short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=758.6s	758.6	 And I put it on in pretty meaningful leverage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=761.1s	761.1	 And it's worked out really well because I was playing the spread.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=765.1s	765.1	 I was basically betting that, you know, the safest company on the internet today is Google
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=769.9s	769.9	 because they're both a platform company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=772.3s	772.3	 And to the extent that they're at risk at being an app company,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=776.6s	776.6	 the risk is to Apple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=777.8s	777.8	 But because they pay Apple so much for search, they're inoculated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=782.3s	782.3	 And so in many ways, Google is the safest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=784.9s	784.9	 And it's also, as we've said before, the purest money-making machine on the internet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=788.6s	788.6	 You're referring, of course, to Google paying Apple $10 billion to be the default search.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=794.2s	794.2	 They own Android, so one platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=796.2s	796.2	 And on the other platform, they pay them so much that they're going to be always protected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=800.6s	800.6	 And the second best company is Microsoft.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=803.1s	803.1	 And we even saw it, by the way, this past week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=805.3s	805.3	 I don't know if you guys saw that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=806.6s	806.6	 But Microsoft decided to take a broadside attack against Notion,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=810.2s	810.2	 which is a productivity app that's been growing very well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=814.1s	814.1	 I felt this when I was on the board of Slack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=816.2s	816.2	 When Microsoft put its gun sights on us, we always thought that they could not out-compete with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=821.3s	821.3	 And what it turns out is when you have a massive distribution advantage,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=826.6s	826.6	 feature parity is enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=827.8s	827.8	 And you can actually be slightly less than good enough on the features
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=831.8s	831.8	 because distribution and bundling and packaging overpower a customer's desire to adopt a product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=837.0s	837.0	 So in the case of Slack, it was very difficult, I think, for us to compete against Microsoft's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=842.2s	842.2	 bundling of teams with all this other software that they were selling and all the discounting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=847.8s	847.8	 that they could do made it very difficult for us to compete because we had a single product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=851.7s	851.7	 And lo and behold, 18 months later, the only real long-term protective solution for Slack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=856.4s	856.4	 shareholders was to basically get bought by Salesforce so that you could be part of a bigger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=860.8s	860.8	 whole. This past week, Microsoft decided to go after Notion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=864.3s	864.3	 And it's going to be, I think, a very similar story where, you know, once they decide to sort
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=869.4s	869.4	 of go after this product experience, they only need to be 80% as good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=874.6s	874.6	 And then the distribution and bundling and packaging will take care of the other 20%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=878.4s	878.4	 It doesn't kill the other company, but it creates headwinds that massive headwinds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=881.8s	881.8	 because because a company like Notion cannot be fully valued over long periods of time simply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=886.6s	886.6	 being an SMB company. At a minimum, you'll have to move into the mid-market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=890.2s	890.2	 You may necessarily never have to go to the enterprise,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=893.3s	893.3	 but you probably have to go to the mid-market. And in that is a very troublesome path because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=897.8s	897.8	 Microsoft has so much, you know, tentacles, so many tentacles inside of those businesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=903.4s	903.4	 So anyway, basically the long Microsoft, long Google is a pretty obvious kind of like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=908.2s	908.2	 monopolistic, you know, pair trade. The question is, what do you short against it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=913.4s	913.4	 so that you can take up the market volatility and you can play spread?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=917.4s	917.4	 Again, Apple has severe, you know, headwinds with respect to inflation pressures
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=922.8s	922.8	 and margins and supply chain issues. Amazon has pretty meaningful headwinds now relative to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=929.9s	929.9	 pricing power and competition. Facebook has pressure with respect to regulatory oversight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=935.4s	935.4	 I just came up with one. What about Airbnb versus the airline?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=940.5s	940.5	 You're talking about smaller, rinky dink ideas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=943.6s	943.6	 Well, I listen, I'm not playing the same chip stack issue. I wasn't there on Tuesday night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=947.1s	947.1	 I'm on a Thursday night. So no, no, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=948.9s	948.9	 A good spread for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=950.1s	950.1	 No, that's a stupid idea. And I'll tell you what, if you're going to put these things on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=953.8s	953.8	 go to where the deepest liquid markets are, because those are the safest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=958.9s	958.9	 Right? Like, like, don't try to be different. Being the same here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=962.9s	962.9	 Tell me why Airbnb, which is an incredible margin business that's incredibly well run and growing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=968.2s	968.2	 versus airlines, which are horribly run and low margin. Why wouldn't that be a good spread trade?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=973.6s	973.6	 I'm just thinking, I think it's a very, very, very too. You're picking two random companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=978.9s	978.9	 I'm not picking one that's out of the hat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=980.9s	980.9	 Well, no, they're both in transportation and vacation and travel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=984.9s	984.9	 They're completely different businesses with completely different motivations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=987.8s	987.8	 with different capital pools, with different people that own the stock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=991.0s	991.0	 There's no point trying to get cute on these things. My point is, if you really want to be hedged
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=996.2s	996.2	 against market risk, go to where it's safest. Find the simplest, most obvious thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1003.5s	1003.5	 Don't overthink it or don't put it on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1005.2s	1005.2	 So another obvious one, here's it. Here's it. So obvious is within big tech,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1010.1s	1010.1	 figure out which ones you want to be long, which ones you want to be short. That's a spread trade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1013.5s	1013.5	 that over the next four or five years, where if you expect a lot of market volatility,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1017.8s	1017.8	 it makes sense to maybe put some of this kind of stuff on right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1021.5s	1021.5	 A different version of this idea, which makes sense is in autos, again, trillions of dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1026.8s	1026.8	 of market cap. And you can make a decision. Do I want to be long, Tesla, Lucid and Rivian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1034.2s	1034.2	 and short the traditional autos that could be a trade? You know, but trying to like trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1040.5s	1040.5	 go after like, let me pick Airbnb versus United Airlines is too random for me. And I don't think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1045.0s	1045.0	 they're correlated enough for it to make any sense. Right. Speaking of the stock market,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1049.8s	1049.8	 sax, you've got the background of the New York Stock Exchange as your zoom background today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1054.6s	1054.6	 What's that about? Yeah, so bird listed on the New York Stock Exchange today, this is a company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1061.2s	1061.2	 that I've been involved in pretty much since the beginning, we'd let the series a round back in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1065.3s	1065.3	 2017. It was actually the first check I wrote as a VC to lead around at craft and four years later,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1072.6s	1072.6	 public company on the New York Stock Exchange. Pretty amazing. And so you're literally at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1077.9s	1077.9	 New York Stock Exchange. Yes, I am in first remote bestie. Yes. And you can see behind me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1085.5s	1085.5	 That is the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. It's not like, you know, if you see the movie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1089.2s	1089.2	 trading places, it's not like that anymore. There are no stockbrokers. There's no like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1093.2s	1093.2	 paper flying around. Got it. I'm not really sure what the purpose of all those monitors are down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1097.8s	1097.8	 there. It feels to me a little bit like a movie set. It is like a movie set. Yeah. And so people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1103.4s	1103.4	 like us come here to record things. But as we all know, the all the trades are really happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1109.2s	1109.2	 inside giant machines. Can you turn around and just start yelling booyah, booyah security comes in?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1118.0s	1118.0	 No, I'm in I'm elevated above the floor. No one can really hear me. I'm in like this sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1124.2s	1124.2	 broadcast booth. So take us behind the decision to go public as a four year old company, we were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1130.5s	1130.5	 expecting, you know, Airbnb, Ubers and lifts took over 10 years to go public. Now here we are sitting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1137.2s	1137.2	 on a four year old public company is like a good thing, a bad thing, something in between. And how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1142.4s	1142.4	 does the board and the management team make that decision to go public? I think it's a good thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1147.7s	1147.7	 Because the company, well, the company wanted to I think it had the opportunity to it. It grew very,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1152.8s	1152.8	 very quickly before COVID. Then you had COVID was like sort of a huge setback. They, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1158.3s	1158.3	 basically the scooter industry to stop for at least six months because of lockdowns. But then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1163.3s	1163.3	 coming out of COVID, they bounced back really strongly, they kind of pivoted their model to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1168.2s	1168.2	 it was called a fleet manager model, where basically they're putting a business in a box
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1172.6s	1172.6	 for a local operator or local entrepreneur to buy the scooters with financing and manage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1178.2s	1178.2	 the fleet themselves. So it's a much more highly virtualized model. And so as a result of that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1184.3s	1184.3	 in Q2, they just did 60 million in revenue in the last quarter. And I think it was a gross profit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1193.0s	1193.0	 of something like 27%. And it was had a loss of like 12 million. So they're very, very close to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1201.0s	1201.0	 getting to profitability. And the company's only four years old, you know, it took uber 12 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1207.6s	1207.6	 or whatever to get to public. So it's been pretty it's been a pretty amazing ride. There've been a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1211.7s	1211.7	 lot of big ups and downs. But so it's kind of a pretty sweet event. What is it trading? I know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1217.4s	1217.4	 it was switchback was like the SPAC name. Right. So it's today was the first day I started trading
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1222.6s	1222.6	 under the ticker symbol brds, I guess all birds took the IRD. So we took brds. And, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1232.2s	1232.2	 there's a total number of shares outstanding of I want to say roughly 300 million. So it's about a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1237.7s	1237.7	 2.4 billion dollar market cap, you know, as it stands right now, which you know, first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1244.2s	1244.2	 series a investors pretty great. Really happy for you sexy. Yeah, congratulations. It's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1248.9s	1248.9	 Congrats, dude. We heard last week Sequoia is going to do the Sequoia fund this evergreen fund
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1253.8s	1253.8	 keep owning shares now as a VC. Do you distribute after four years of this investment and you made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1260.7s	1260.7	 multiple investments? Or do you make the decision, hey, we think it's undervalued, we have,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1265.6s	1265.6	 you know, conviction in the company, we were going to be in it for 10 years, or do you just take the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1269.5s	1269.5	 quick win and give everybody their shares? Well, I've I've agreed to be on the board for the next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1273.7s	1273.7	 year. So, you know, I'm planning to do that. And we have a traditional six month lockup. And so at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1281.3s	1281.3	 that point, we'd have to make a decision about when or how much to distribute the shares. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1286.7s	1286.7	 this is the first time we've been confronted with decision. I mean, Kraft Ventures is only a four
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1290.6s	1290.6	 year old firm. And like I said, this is actually the first round that I led as a VC. So it's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1295.7s	1295.7	 first time you've been confronted with a distribution of this magnitude, we've had some smaller
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1300.0s	1300.0	 distributions. So yeah, we still have to make those decisions. We haven't decided yet what we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1304.1s	1304.1	 going to do. If you if the stock is up, let's say, meaningfully in the next six months, and you get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1308.9s	1308.9	 to that, you know, six months and a day, and you have the ability to distribute, and it's up 25%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1315.2s	1315.2	 And you're looking at it, businesses thriving, you're on the board. Do you consider holding for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1320.5s	1320.5	 a year or two so that you can distribute at $16 $25 or whatever your price target is?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1327.1s	1327.1	 Maybe we haven't gotten to that point yet. So yeah, I mean, I guess what I would say is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1331.7s	1331.7	 that our bias would be to distribute shares to our LPs, so that they can make their own decisions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1340.3s	1340.3	 about whether they're told or not. As long as we think the stock is, you know, price fairly, if for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1345.7s	1345.7	 some reason we thought it wasn't, then there'd be additional reasons to hold on to it and make the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1350.7s	1350.7	 distribution later. Jamoth, what are your thoughts on this given it's come up before?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1356.0s	1356.0	 And a number of us are going to be faced with this decision. And then we see Sequoia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1359.5s	1359.5	 has got LP buy in for an evergreen fund. Well, I think an evergreen fund is different from having
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1364.5s	1364.5	 to figure out how to do distributions. So they're they're solving for two different ideas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1371.0s	1371.0	 The evergreen fund is really good because you don't have to do this continual fundraising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1376.6s	1376.6	 process. And you can basically roll gains back into the next tranche of invested companies in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1382.2s	1382.2	 an easier way. I like that idea. It was pretty rare at the time. I remember when I was starting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1387.5s	1387.5	 social capital, the only fund that did it really well was Sutter Hill. And for a whole host of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1393.1s	1393.1	 reasons, I decided to not do an evergreen fund. In hindsight, I think for me, that turned out to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1399.0s	1399.0	 better because then it was easier for me to wind down and have a clear demarcation of when it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1404.9s	1404.9	 just myself and other LPs versus when it was just my capital. But there were some really good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1412.6s	1412.6	 reasons to do it. The hardest thing I think that Sequoia is going to find in this new iteration is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1420.3s	1420.3	 at some point, somebody's reputation will be on the line for judging public equities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1426.7s	1426.7	 And it's still not clear to me that people who live and breathe venture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1430.7s	1430.7	 can context switch well enough to then live and breathe public equities. So just the best example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1435.7s	1435.7	 I would say is like Tiger Global. When you look inside that organization, which is incredibly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1440.4s	1440.4	 well run, there are two superb investors that carved the universe up, right? You have Chase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1446.0s	1446.0	 Coleman that runs a public book and you have Scott Schleifer that runs a private book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1449.7s	1449.7	 What does it prove? To me, it proves that it's just very hard to find a person that can do both.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1454.8s	1454.8	 And the context switching is very complicated. So maybe Sequoia finds an income that's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1460.6s	1460.6	 an incredible public market strategist that can then manage these positions. Otherwise,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1465.0s	1465.0	 but they've done this for a few years, right? Sequoia, I don't know, people realize this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1470.4s	1470.4	 they set up the Heritage Fund and they set it up with only GP's money. It's got billions under
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1475.8s	1475.8	 management and it's been making late stage private, but mostly public equity investing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1481.8s	1481.8	 I know, but that's a fund to funds. What I'm saying is, I'll be very honest with you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1486.2s	1486.2	 if I was an LP of Sequoia, I would want the money back. And the reason is I'm not sure that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1492.4s	1492.4	 Sequoia can compound money in the public markets anywhere near what I could. So-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1496.9s	1496.9	 Do you buy the point that they make that like exiting some of these left most of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1502.5s	1502.5	 value creation on the table? No, I think what they're saying something much more subtle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1505.9s	1505.9	 which is they exited and they have regrets for selling. You have to remember,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1510.7s	1510.7	 when Sequoia distributed Google, every single partner got Google shares. Now, had they held
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1518.4s	1518.4	 those shares, they wouldn't be saying any of this. And famously, I'll tell you, when I-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1521.4s	1521.4	 They held their shares. I know that. I actually do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1525.8s	1525.8	 Fair enough, but maybe they did, maybe they didn't. But let's just put it out there that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1529.5s	1529.5	 for example, I know explicitly when I almost merged social capital with Kleiner Perkins,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1533.4s	1533.4	 like six years ago, I spent so much time with John Doar, the most incredible thing that I was so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1539.0s	1539.0	 impressed with Doar was he was he told me he had never sold a single share of Amazon that was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1544.7s	1544.7	 distributed to him. And he had only sold a handful of shares of Google, only to fund future capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1550.8s	1550.8	 requirements at Kleiner at the time. So I just think that ultimately, I think probably what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1557.6s	1557.6	 Sequoia was saying is, man, I wish I had not sold my Google shares when they were distributed to me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1562.1s	1562.1	 because otherwise they wouldn't make that claim. No, I think what they're saying is more subtle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1565.4s	1565.4	 I think they're saying you as our LPs should have held them. We are on the board of these companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1570.2s	1570.2	 from day one. We have better insights in the second decade than in the first. Production board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1575.9s	1575.9	 founder David Friedberg, how do you think about early exits, distributing capital, because you do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1581.5s	1581.5	 have also with a startup studio structure, which you should explain to the audience how a startup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1585.4s	1585.4	 studio works, because you create companies, which is, you know, was a terrible place to be maybe five
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1590.9s	1590.9	 or 10 years ago, but it turns out you're in the best place because zero to one is where all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1594.3s	1594.3	 values created. Explain the two things. What a startup studio is for people who don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1600.1s	1600.1	 And then what's your view of selling early if a company of yours goes public?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1605.4s	1605.4	 I think there's a big there's a bigger kind of framing here, which is a lot of investors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1613.0s	1613.0	 you know, professional money managers have tried to find ways to create what is called permanent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1618.2s	1618.2	 capital, which is a vehicle whereby they can continuously make investments, decide when to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1623.3s	1623.3	 sell those investments and recycle the capital into new investments. With the idea being that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1628.0s	1628.0	 over time, they're not at risk of capital outflows, meaning investors pull their money out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1632.8s	1632.8	 and they're not at risk of, you know, needing to kind of go out and raise more money and they can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1638.8s	1638.8	 they can share in the value creation as they grow their book value over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1642.6s	1642.6	 Years ago, a bunch of hedge funds set up public reinsurance companies. Dan Loeb did this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1649.6s	1649.6	 What's his name? Einhorn did this. And basically, Bill Ackman did it. What they did is they set up a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1655.0s	1655.0	 public company and you have a company, a reinsurer, and then they use that reinsurer to underwrite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1661.2s	1661.2	 reinsurance. And when you underwrite reinsurance, you get all this capital that you can then go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1664.5s	1664.5	 invest. And then the hedge fund managed that investment. And because it's actually a public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1668.7s	1668.7	 company, it's got a balance sheet. The shareholders can't pull their money out, right? It's just got a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1674.6s	1674.6	 balance sheet. And the hedge fund was managing that balance sheet and generating good returns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1679.7s	1679.7	 And this is effectively what Warren Buffett does. And everyone looks to Berkshire Hathaway and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1683.0s	1683.0	 Warren Buffett. It's kind of the key kind of long term here, which is, hey, look, if you can keep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1690.4s	1690.4	 investing and keep compounding value, this thing can grow exponentially over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1696.8s	1696.8	 So the way we set up the production board, I had the option of raising a fund and being a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1701.2s	1701.2	 fund manager. I chose to set up the production board because I was much more interested in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1705.0s	1705.0	 I think, the similar sort of vein of what Sequoia is saying, which is how do you become a longer term
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1710.0s	1710.0	 builder and a longer term holder and where you don't have these incentives to return capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1714.3s	1714.3	 because you only get paid if and when you return capital. And then you're kind of making these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1720.5s	1720.5	 decisions because your shareholders are saying, well, you had a good return, quickly give me the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1724.2s	1724.2	 shares back and mark your profit and take your share. And I was also more interested in, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1729.5s	1729.5	 the fact is over time, there's always going to be opportunities to chase with the capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1733.7s	1733.7	 So if we have a great gain, if something works out really well, we can take the gain and we can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1738.7s	1738.7	 reinvest that capital in building new things. There's no shortage of opportunities to pursue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1742.6s	1742.6	 for the rest of my life. So that's why I set up the production board initially in partnership
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1747.0s	1747.0	 with Alphabet. And then later on, we brought in Bill Gates and other Allen and Co. and other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1751.9s	1751.9	 kind of investors that have a similar sort of mindset, which is like, let's just, if we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1756.4s	1756.4	 an exit, recycle that capital and continuously build value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1759.1s	1759.1	 Because they're not looking for a quick win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1760.9s	1760.9	 They don't have pension payments to make, right? They don't have a reason to distribute cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1765.3s	1765.3	 And so same with me, like I don't have a reason to take cash out. So the objective was just build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1769.7s	1769.7	 this thing over time and grow value over time. And that's why I set it up the way I did. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1774.2s	1774.2	 think it allows us to make really long term bets that are super risky. Most of what we're doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1779.8s	1779.8	 is super technical and difficult and may be very hard to pull off, many of which are still after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1785.3s	1785.3	 many years in a very early stage. So you need very patient capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1788.6s	1788.6	 Patient capital and also the preference for not trying to find exits. But I have found this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1794.5s	1794.5	 I'll tell you one thing. I have been through a number of circumstances where I have seen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1798.3s	1798.3	 businesses I've been an investor in or involved in that have traded long term value for short term
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1804.0s	1804.0	 opportunity. Meaning there's an opportunity to make a business that you can then go raise capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1808.6s	1808.6	 against. You change your strategy to do that. Then you go raise VC funding. And now the business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1813.4s	1813.4	 looks like it's working. But the 10x or 100x opportunity was taken off the table because you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1818.9s	1818.9	 ended up going down this different path that was a sure thing that was more likely to work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1823.6s	1823.6	 that created value in the short term that allowed you to mark up your investment or raise capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1827.4s	1827.4	 against that. But you gave up the big long term thing. And I think that's something I've been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1831.0s	1831.0	 trying to avoid with the structure. And it certainly makes sense with some of these other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1834.5s	1834.5	 folks and what they're trying to do. So what we're getting at here, Sacks, is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1838.4s	1838.4	 decision making by capital allocators. And on behalf of their LPs or letting the LPs make those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1845.4s	1845.4	 decisions, inevitably the crypto world says, well, why aren't you just doing this in a Dow?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1852.0s	1852.0	 And, you know, having some decentralized authority make the decisions. I had Vinny Ling,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1858.4s	1858.4	 I had a conversation with our friend Vinny Ling, after the Solana stuff and multi coin capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1864.4s	1864.4	 And we were talking about Dows for early stage investing or syndicates and just brainstorming,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1869.6s	1869.6	 hey, is there a way to do this? And the problem I came to every time was, should a bunch of folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1875.6s	1875.6	 be making decisions who are not meeting with the companies or meeting with 2000 companies a year?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1881.8s	1881.8	 What are your thoughts on a Dow representing sort of what we collectively do, but we all do it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1888.9s	1888.9	 obviously, in different flavors? Does this actually exist? Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1893.4s	1893.4	 Well, there have been Dows that have existed to vote on buying NFTs. So yes, for collectibles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1898.8s	1898.8	 I mean, I kind of feel like I'll let you know when it actually gets here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1902.6s	1902.6	 So open minded to it, but who knows? Yeah. But I mean, we talk about these things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1905.8s	1905.8	 if they already are here, and they're not quite here. I mean, technically, I know they exist,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1909.9s	1909.9	 but people haven't really figured out how to use them to, you know, to be a fund manager, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1917.0s	1917.0	 I think David's right. I think the look, I there are these three immutable features of Web 3.0,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1924.4s	1924.4	 that we're going to have to figure out over the next few years. So the obvious ones are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1928.7s	1928.7	 decentralization, right? That makes sense. The second obvious one is the level of composability,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1934.7s	1934.7	 which means that you're plug and play with everything. But the third one is this idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1939.3s	1939.3	 of democratization and governance, right? And that's where Dows come in. And David's right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1943.8s	1943.8	 we don't really know what the boundaries of that feature is. I think it exists in some small level
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1951.7s	1951.7	 scale. But we need to have many iterations of companies get built to figure out what it'll mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1960.2s	1960.2	 So I don't know, I'm taking a pretty traditional approach, Jason, which is that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1964.3s	1964.3	 you know, it's kind of like a crawl walk run strategy. Right now, I'm in the crawling phase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1968.3s	1968.3	 And I'm kind of saying how did web 1.0 and web 2.0 develop, and I'm trying to just copying it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1975.7s	1975.7	 So you know, in web 1.0 and 2.0, you needed companies like Sun Microsystems and Cisco and,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1982.2s	1982.2	 you know, all of the plumbers foundational stuff to build plumbing for the internet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1987.6s	1987.6	 to allow the 1000 flowers to bloom at the application level. And you know, we had a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1992.8s	1992.8	 very good reference model, by the way, for web 1.0 for most people, if you want to look at it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=1996.6s	1996.6	 it's called the OSI reference stack. And if you actually look at that OSI stack,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2000.5s	2000.5	 you can translate that to all kinds of value creation over the first, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2005.8s	2005.8	 two arcs of the internet over 20 years, trillions of dollars was created by just following each of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2011.1s	2011.1	 those substrates. And in those transitional layers was where these great, beautiful companies were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2016.3s	2016.3	 built. And I think similarly, we're going to do that again, but we need a different stack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2020.6s	2020.6	 to represent what web 3 is. So yeah, you know, this week, we did something which was pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2025.8s	2025.8	 straightforward, which was this idea that if you're going to build all these apps, you're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2030.2s	2030.2	 to need a distributed compute infrastructure, which means you're going to need very simple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2034.7s	2034.7	 building blocks like remote procedure calls RPC that exists in web 2.0. It's kind of a not something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2040.9s	2040.9	 you don't really think about. But in web 3 doesn't exist. And so it's all this AWS, you know, GCP,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2047.0s	2047.0	 like infrastructure that has to get built. And that's what syndica does. And I think that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2052.8s	2052.8	 a really very interesting observation there, because everybody is trying to go to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2058.0s	2058.0	 application level and talk about the consumer experience. But before you even have the ability,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2063.4s	2063.4	 you know, we're talking about cars before we've even made a transmission or, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2067.7s	2067.7	 an ice engine. That's exactly right. This is why crypto comes across as so delusional and strange.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2072.0s	2072.0	 Sometimes they wrote 3000 ICO papers. None of them were about infrastructure, they're all about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2077.5s	2077.5	 some sort of endgame. The thing is, it's a very delicate balancing act, right? You need a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2081.7s	2081.7	 handful of companies that capture consumer imagination, right, that then incentivize all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2087.0s	2087.0	 of the plumbing companies to come in and build underneath it, right? So it's a very, it's a very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2091.4s	2091.4	 delicate balancing act, right? So you needed CompuServe in order to enable a bunch of companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2096.0s	2096.0	 then you needed AOL in order to enable another set, then you needed Yahoo, then you needed Google.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2101.2s	2101.2	 And in all of that, what happened was people were pulled through, right? You needed Amazon commerce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2107.1s	2107.1	 to justify AWS. So we're in that world where it's going to be a little back and forth where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2112.8s	2112.8	 the pendulum will swing back and forth between consumer experiences that capture imagination,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2117.0s	2117.0	 get to some level of scale, that then create incentives for the developer ecosystem and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2122.1s	2122.1	 technology infrastructure to catch up. Zillow, which we talked about previously became an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2127.2s	2127.2	 eye buyer. What's an eye buyer? That means you buy a bunch of single family homes in all likelihood,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2133.0s	2133.0	 like Opendoor and Redfin have been doing. And then you hope to flip them, maybe improve them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2139.1s	2139.1	 and maybe lower costs to the consumers by taking out real estate brokers. This has created a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2146.1s	2146.1	 bad feelings amongst real estate brokers. A TikTok video trended a couple of months ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2151.8s	2151.8	 where a broker said or accused Zillow of buying up these homes in order to do price fixing and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2158.0s	2158.0	 to corner the market on homes. Well, it turns out that Zillow, which has an incredible CEO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2164.6s	2164.6	 in Rich Barton and has done tremendously over the decades. According ahead of their earnings call
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2170.3s	2170.3	 this week, Bloomberg reported Zillow is trying to offload 7000 homes for 2.8 billion. That's about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2178.2s	2178.2	 a 400k average per home. And Zillow shares dropped 37% this week alone from 100 to 66. Their market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2186.1s	2186.1	 cap has dropped 9 billion throughout the week. And they're down 70% from a peak valuation of 48
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2192.2s	2192.2	 billion just in February about six months ago. Zillow is going to reduce its workforce by 25%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2198.2s	2198.2	 over the next few months. I'm assuming that's all those eye buyers anecdotally, a lot of what I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2203.2s	2203.2	 hearing is they bought homes indiscriminately. The anecdotal stories that are breaking on Twitter and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2208.7s	2208.7	 other forums with real estate brokers are they would look at a home, they didn't know that it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2213.7s	2213.7	 had a noisy neighbor or it was near power lines or whatever the people who came in bought them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2217.8s	2217.8	 indiscriminately, maybe too fast. Whereas some other companies maybe open door or Redfin were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2222.7s	2222.7	 more considered I actually had Glenn from Redfin on the pod not long ago. And he said it's a very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2227.3s	2227.3	 hard operational business. You have to be very careful on what you buy in your entry price. That
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2231.4s	2231.4	 seems to have turned out to be true. What do you think Friedberg? Rich Barton, who runs Zillow is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2237.7s	2237.7	 considered a legend in Silicon Valley. He has been involved in some of the most successful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2245.2s	2245.2	 internet companies. And when he stepped back in as the founder of Zillow step back in to run the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2250.9s	2250.9	 business a few years ago, it was viewed as kind of a second resurrection of this business and he was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2257.5s	2257.5	 going to take it into new areas. And then three and a half years ago, he announced the Sidebuyer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2260.8s	2260.8	 program, which everyone thought was such an incredibly strong move and obviously chased
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2265.6s	2265.6	 open door, which Chamath is involved in and I'm sure we'll share more on. But it was such an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2270.5s	2270.5	 obvious opportunity that if you could add liquidity to the real estate market, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2274.8s	2274.8	 residential real estate market, there's an incredible amount of value to be had.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2278.7s	2278.7	 Now, the way that they wrote about it when they talked about it initially, and then the way that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2282.6s	2282.6	 they've kind of talked about in their earnings report this week was that they were trying to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2285.6s	2285.6	 a quote market maker in the business. And it turned out that what they were really doing was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2290.6s	2290.6	 being more of a speculator, right? A market maker looks at bids and asks and the spread and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2294.6s	2294.6	 tries to create a gap in that spread and make and take some share of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2300.2s	2300.2	 And by adding that liquidity, the idea is the spreads can narrow and they can make money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2304.5s	2304.5	 In this case, they were looking at the historical velocity of selling prices of homes and using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2312.0s	2312.0	 that as a way to kind of project what was going to happen, which makes them much more of a speculator
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2317.0s	2317.0	 than a market maker. And they clearly got this wrong. And they're kind of quote unquote models on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2323.4s	2323.4	 where a price is headed, ended up getting them in trouble. There's also the inherent conflict
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2328.0s	2328.0	 where they are now competing in a way with the brokers that generate a lot of revenue for them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2332.1s	2332.1	 and are a big part of their core business. And they were clearly cannibalizing their own business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2337.9s	2337.9	 where the Zestimate and some of the other scoring that they provide as a data and analytics platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2341.8s	2341.8	 to both sides of the existing market starts to get blown up because they're coming in and saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2346.0s	2346.0	 we're going to put our foot down and say, this is what the value is. And it inevitably kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2351.0s	2351.0	 cannibalizes the core product that they provide to both sides of the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2355.2s	2355.2	 So, one could argue this was flawed from the beginning. The execution clearly was way off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2359.6s	2359.6	 And it begs the question, where was leadership in kind of tracking what was going on here as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2364.5s	2364.5	 these guys were buying homes at market prices that are well above what they were actually selling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2369.0s	2369.0	 for in the market. No one was actually doing on the ground work. They were all doing kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2372.6s	2372.6	 speculative models and saying, this is what we think will happen. And then they woke up way too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2377.6s	2377.6	 late and lost way too much money. I think they lost $300 million in the quarter. So, really a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2383.6s	2383.6	 lot of questions and a lot of challenges on this. I'm sure Chamath has a point of view on what makes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2389.3s	2389.3	 Open Door distinct from Zillow. But there's a really important kind of underlying here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2397.3s	2397.3	 Yeah, the maturity of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who's crushed it so many times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2402.5s	2402.5	 doesn't mean that they're perfect. And this was a big miss.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2405.5s	2405.5	 You can go really too fast into a turn here. And clearly they flip the car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2409.5s	2409.5	 Chamath, I don't know how comfortable you are talking about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2412.2s	2412.2	 I'm very comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2413.3s	2413.3	 Okay, well then here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2416.2s	2416.2	 Number one, you know, I'm not on the board of Open Door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2419.9s	2419.9	 Of Open Door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2420.7s	2420.7	 Maybe tell us about your history with Open Door. Chamath would be super.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2424.4s	2424.4	 Look, I am one of the largest individual shareholders of that company, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2428.0s	2428.0	 somewhere between three and 4% of the business I own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2430.6s	2430.6	 We, you know, I came to own those shares with a large investment, as well as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2436.6s	2436.6	 through the transaction, where we merged
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2441.5s	2441.5	 one of our SPACs into it and took it public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2443.5s	2443.5	 Is that IPOB?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2445.2s	2445.2	 Yes. Couple things to say. The first is about the CEO and founder of Open Door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2451.9s	2451.9	 Eric Wu is special, special, special. So let me just leave it at that. On that topic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2460.3s	2460.3	 The second is, I think that Rich Barton is very special, but it speaks to two big mistakes that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2467.8s	2467.8	 Zillow made. The first is that catching a wave of disruption is very difficult when you have an old
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2477.7s	2477.7	 line business that is fundamentally competitive with the new line of business. And Zillow,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2483.0s	2483.0	 as David said, had this thing called Zestimate, whose entire job was to directionally drive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2488.8s	2488.8	 top of funnel traffic into the rest of their media business. Now imagine you go to a website
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2494.1s	2494.1	 to look up your house value or somebody else's house value. Accuracy is a bug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2501.0s	2501.0	 The feature that makes Zestimate work is a highly inflated house price. Right? Like if you go and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2507.9s	2507.9	 you see a crazy house price number, that's interesting. That's more click worthy than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2514.6s	2514.6	 if you go in there and it shows some depressed value, you'd think the site sucks. That's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2518.2s	2518.2	 unfortunate psychological reaction. So I think whether we believe it or not, or whether Zillow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2524.0s	2524.0	 knew it or not, Zestimate over time, basically calcified this idea of price inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2531.4s	2531.4	 So the accuracy was never a goal. So then if you take that business and then you try to orient it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2536.6s	2536.6	 towards home buying and you use probably Zestimate or some version of it to underpin how you buy and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2542.0s	2542.0	 take risk, it creates a lot of risk. And I think this is essentially what played out where they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2546.2s	2546.2	 were over buying homes and they didn't know how to price this stuff accurately. So my partner, Ravi,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2552.5s	2552.5	 tweeted this out, but the open door margin on average is about 10%. The Zillow margin on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2558.6s	2558.6	 average was 3%. So they had a much more razor thin margin of safety here, which again speaks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2564.3s	2564.3	 to pricing. And then it speaks to this third thing, which is that if you start doing one thing and do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2570.7s	2570.7	 it really well with software, the gains over years really compound. And so when somebody else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2577.9s	2577.9	 shows up and tries to pivot their business to try to copy it, it's very, very difficult. The classic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2583.4s	2583.4	 example is Google versus Yahoo. Yahoo had a beautiful directory driven business. But when Larry and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2589.3s	2589.3	 Sergey, really Larry invented PageRank and then invented that first version of a Google search index,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2595.3s	2595.3	 as we saw it play out over the next 10 or 15 years, it was impossible for Yahoo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2600.5s	2600.5	 to really invest the technical capital necessary to catch up with Google. And every day and every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2607.0s	2607.0	 week and every year, as Freeberg talked about last week, those technical gains compound and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2618.7s	2618.7	 back and the ability to accurately forecast price and volatility and the ability to sell these assets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2627.7s	2627.7	 at a defined margin of safety in a predictable way is something software can solve. And it seems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2635.5s	2635.5	 that Open Door is the first doesn't necessarily mean it'll be the only one. But it has an enormous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2642.4s	2642.4	 head start now. And as long as they can keep iterating those gains will compound. So that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2648.7s	2648.7	 what I think I just think this is a wonderful business run by an incredible CEO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2654.2s	2654.2	 To wrap up this Zillow story, Sax, any thoughts on, you know, Trimalt's point here, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2660.5s	2660.5	 you're the rating agency, and you had this business and the business might be orthogonal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2665.7s	2665.7	 to the existing money printing machine. On a strategic basis, what do you think any lessons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2670.9s	2670.9	 or mistakes here in terms of when you handicap Zillow? Or do you want to just move on and talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2675.9s	2675.9	 politics? I mean, look, I'm a I was a seed investor in Open Door, because rabbi invited me to the seed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2680.9s	2680.9	 round. So, you know, I'm a little biased here. But I think it's pretty obvious what happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2686.6s	2686.6	 Zillow tried to copy them, the business is much more operationally complicated than they realized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2691.5s	2691.5	 It's a low business, low margin business with a ton, which requires a ton of capital. So if you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2697.4s	2697.4	 off a little bit, the losses can be huge. And Zillow couldn't figure it out. They underestimated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2702.4s	2702.4	 the difficulty. That's what frequently happens with a big company tries to copy a smaller sort
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2706.9s	2706.9	 of upstart company. So I mean, that to me is what happened in a nutshell, quite frankly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2710.9s	2710.9	 we're an hour into this pod, we haven't discussed issues, any issue that I think is broadly relevant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2715.7s	2715.7	 to most Americans. I think this is one of our worst episodes, we're going to bore everyone to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2719.4s	2719.4	 tears. I frankly don't understand what the fuck you're doing. I don't even know why we have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2722.4s	2722.4	 topic list. When you start pulling your ass like Dals, and I don't know what the fuck else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2727.3s	2727.3	 All right, all right, fine. We'll talk about politics. The doubt question sucked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2731.8s	2731.8	 All right, I'm just giving you the opportunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2733.9s	2733.9	 To be talking about cut it out of the show. Cut it out. So should we cut Jesus Christ?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2744.4s	2744.4	 Yeah, I agree. I think we should cut all that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2748.6s	2748.6	 Jason, I agree that that part where we cut it. That's all right. Fine. You got some loser.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2753.6s	2753.6	 I'm trying to give you guys the benefit of the doubt to just because it was no one cares.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2758.0s	2758.0	 All right, fuck. Calm down, everybody. You want to talk about politics, we talk about politics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2763.1s	2763.1	 Okay, sacks. Go ahead. Tell us about the election. Okay, I'll just rattle off some of the key results
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2767.1s	2767.1	 here from blue states. We have a woke lash going on all across the country. That's the important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2772.6s	2772.6	 thing. In Virginia, a state that Biden won by 10. He's cranky, huge upset Republican Glenn Yonkin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2779.4s	2779.4	 beat Terry McCall, a former governor there. He was this was a huge upset McCall was supposed to win
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2785.0s	2785.0	 Yonkin 151 48. So that's a 13 point swing versus where Biden was just a year ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2795.3s	2795.3	 In New Jersey, a state that Biden won by 16 points, the Democrat held on to it, but only by 1.5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2801.0s	2801.0	 points. And I bet you anything, the RNC is kicking itself. They didn't give any money to Chatterally,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2805.9s	2805.9	 who's the challenger, who I think almost who came very, very close. And there were down ticket
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2812.3s	2812.3	 seats that went Republican. So the this is really interesting in South Jersey, which is a blue collar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2821.5s	2821.5	 bastion for Democrats, we need versus burr. That's right. The Democratic states and leaders Steve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2826.9s	2826.9	 Sweeney lost to a truck driver named Ed Durer, who spent a grand total of $153 on his campaign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2833.6s	2833.6	 Okay, so those are some and then we had some other right in like he was printing out to say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2838.7s	2838.7	 write me in, I think, I don't think it's a writing but, but in any event, so implications for 2022,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2844.6s	2844.6	 Dave Wasserman of Cook political report calculates somewhere between a 44 and 51
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2849.3s	2849.3	 C game from the GOP, they only need five seats to win the majority. So it's looking very bleak for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2854.2s	2854.2	 the Democrats in 2022. And then I think you also had some very interesting local elections.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2860.6s	2860.6	 In Minneapolis, voters rejected a proposal to defund the police with 56% of the vote. They,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2867.8s	2867.8	 there was a ballot proposition to change that police department into some sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2872.2s	2872.2	 larger public safety group voters were having none of it. In Seattle, which is a very liberal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2878.5s	2878.5	 city, they voted for a literal Republican as city attorney, which is the office of prosecutes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2884.2s	2884.2	 misdemeanors. So against a police abolitionists who said she would stop prosecuting misdemeanors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2891.0s	2891.0	 You're forgetting that in Virginia, it wasn't just Glenn Yonkin that won, but basically,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2895.4s	2895.4	 it was Terry McAuliffe. And then a lieutenant governor who was some milk toast individual,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2901.9s	2901.9	 and an attorney general candidate who was caught in blackface, which by the way, there is no more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2907.9s	2907.9	 racist thing you can do just to put to let you guys that everybody true doubt all the non colors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2914.0s	2914.0	 Okay, that guys please don't do blackface or brownface. It's such a bad it's just not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2918.1s	2918.1	 it's not right. It was a sweep. So the lieutenant and Yonkin and it was a it was a black female
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2923.0s	2923.0	 lieutenant governor and a Latino attorney general. That's right. And they swept right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2927.3s	2927.3	 That's right. That's right. So the lieutenant governor was Winston Sears. She's a black woman
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2932.4s	2932.4	 Republican. If you've seen the photo of her she's strictly photographed with a giant assault rifle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2937.0s	2937.0	 in her hands. That's her and then a Hispanic Attorney General Jason Mears one as well. So yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2944.6s	2944.6	 it was a huge sweep. And then you know, in Long Island and Staten Island, which again are blue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2949.8s	2949.8	 counties, you had two Republican prosecutors beat the local sort of incumbent Democrat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2956.0s	2956.0	 decarceration. Just I think I think this is very clear, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2963.3s	2963.3	 Trump was behaviorally extreme. And after four years, people were sick of it. Nobody wanted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2970.1s	2970.1	 that behavioral extremism because it was unpredictable and people felt frankly in danger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2975.1s	2975.1	 And I think that that was legitimate. He also turned out to be extremely lazy and probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2979.6s	2979.6	 pretty dumb. Now what we're realizing is the different form of extremism, which is policy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2985.4s	2985.4	 extremism will also be met with the same response, which is that you you can't sustain election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2990.2s	2990.2	 results and wins, right? So people care consistently about three things. They care about the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=2996.6s	2996.6	 They care about the education of their children. And they care about safety. And the thing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3002.1s	3002.1	 Glenn Youngkin did, which I thought was at least a playbook for centrists and the right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3010.0s	3010.0	 and it's also a playbook for the Democrats, if they choose to embrace it, is to understand that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3014.9s	3014.9	 these things are reaching a tipping point where, you know, again, we've said this before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3019.6s	3019.6	 it is possible to live in a state of mind where you believe in Black Lives Matter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3024.0s	3024.0	 and you believe in law and order, right? And and when you try to pit those two things against each
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3030.0s	3030.0	 other, for example, like, you would have thought the one place where they would have basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3034.9s	3034.9	 defunded the police in its entirety would have been Minneapolis after George Floyd, but instead,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3039.8s	3039.8	 even they drew the line and said, No, or New York, or New York, there was a there was a really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3045.7s	3045.7	 compelling quote, actually, by this woman, I think it was in the New York Times. And what she said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3051.4s	3051.4	 was, I didn't elect Joe Biden to be FDR, I elected him to tack to the middle, and just calm things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3058.2s	3058.2	 down so that everybody could exhale so that we could reset. Same with me. And what's that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3063.2s	3063.2	 That was Abigail Spanberger, actually. She's a Virginia Democrat. Yeah, she's a Virginia Democrat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3068.2s	3068.2	 who won a seat in one of those blue counties that just flipped red to vote for Yonkin. And since she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3074.2s	3074.2	 got elected, I guess she got elected last year, she's been telling the Democratic, but she's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3078.7s	3078.7	 one who called out Pelosi in that, you know, caucus meeting, saying, I don't ever want to hear the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3083.8s	3083.8	 words defund the police again, that is electoral poison. And then she said, Yes, nobody elected
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3088.2s	3088.2	 Biden to be FDR, they elected him to be normal and stop the chaos. And so yeah, certainly my vote.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3094.2s	3094.2	 Yeah, there's a big backlash going on, because Biden has decided to start governing like Bernie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3098.2s	3098.2	 Sanders. No one elected him to do that. So sex is the lesson Dems learn learned this time around is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3105.0s	3105.0	 it's very easy to beat Trump, but it's very hard to beat a moderate Republican. No, no, it's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3111.5s	3111.5	 that it's that you just have to be a rational, normal person. That's what I mean by a moderate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3116.1s	3116.1	 Republican. Well, you just have to be moderate. I don't think it matters. But this is the key
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3121.0s	3121.0	 takeaway. It was so easy for them to use Trump and beat Trump, you know, but these three topics are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3126.7s	3126.7	 not a Republican tentpole nor the Democratic temple. They are the tentpole of reasonable people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3132.7s	3132.7	 Yes, meaning which most people are reasonable. Hey, guys, get out of the way so that we can,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3136.9s	3136.9	 you know, have a reasonable life in an economy. Hey, folks, please make sure my kids when I send
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3141.9s	3141.9	 them to school for eight hours a day, come back reasonably educated and please keep my street
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3146.2s	3146.2	 safe. And I'm not really willing to decarcerate ad hoc to such a degree that all of a sudden crime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3152.0s	3152.0	 gets out of control. Those are not democratic or Republican tentpoles. Those are just moderate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3156.8s	3156.8	 centrist rational things to believe in. Yeah, being and also behave normally, like I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3162.1s	3162.1	 whatever happened with these progressives where they couldn't pass, you know, the stimulus bills,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3166.6s	3166.6	 and things that almost everybody agreed on. Glenn Yonkin was not behaviorally extremist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3172.2s	3172.2	 Yes. And and from a policy perspective was pretty much down the middle. Eric Adams, Eric Adams
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3179.0s	3179.0	 is not behaviorally extreme, and he is politically down the middle. The mayor of Buffalo who got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3184.5s	3184.5	 reelected is not behaviorally extreme. And he's politically down the middle. Do you start to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3189.8s	3189.8	 a pattern here? Yeah, nobody wants AOC Bernie, Elizabeth Warren or Trump. I think it's not it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3195.9s	3195.9	 not a question of AOC or Bernie or Trump. It's just that right now, the temperature of America is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3201.5s	3201.5	 let's just all exhale and just re center ourselves as a country. Yeah. And so moderation and centrism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3209.2s	3209.2	 is actually what calls for today. I don't know how to predict what happens in 15 or 20 years. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3214.0s	3214.0	 maybe AOC is the canary in the coal mine for where the country goes by a plurality of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3220.2s	3220.2	 in 15 or 20 years. But what's clear is it's not where it goes today. And I think that we it all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3226.2s	3226.2	 behooves us to just take a real step back and exhale and just read the tea leaves because every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3230.8s	3230.8	 single thing that the democrats tried to do to sort of like make this extreme really didn't work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3236.7s	3236.7	 the race baiting, all of that stuff really kind of failed. And I think that that's important to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3242.0s	3242.0	 listen to, you know, because you had a lot of black, Indian, Chinese families that just showed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3247.3s	3247.3	 up Hispanics, you know, that again, reliable democratic voters, and voted for Glenn Youngkin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3254.5s	3254.5	 in a way that was surprising to me, right. And then so if you compare New Jersey and, and Virginia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3261.4s	3261.4	 Biden won Virginia by 10. He the democratic nominee lost, Biden won New Jersey by 16.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3271.0s	3271.0	 And Phil Murphy barely sweep by was like 10,000 votes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3274.3s	3274.3	 Jersey has always had a Republican kind of leaning group. They're very tuned to Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3280.2s	3280.2	 won by 16. There should have been a cakewalk. I think that 16 how much of that is get Trump out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3285.5s	3285.5	 of office is what we I think the democrats need to parse and radical we're repudiating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3291.8s	3291.8	 behavioral extremism and policy extremism. So I think we just need to realize rational, normal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3298.4s	3298.4	 chill people who can do reasonable things, get our kids educated. So for example, on the education
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3303.7s	3303.7	 front. I don't know if you guys saw this, because I tweeted and you can put this Nick in the group
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3307.8s	3307.8	 chat. But in California right now, there's a battle over math class ridiculous, right, where the title,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3314.2s	3314.2	 I'm just going to read the title, because it sets it off California tries to close the gap in math,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3318.4s	3318.4	 but sets off a backlash proposed guidelines in the state would deemphasize calculus, reject the idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3324.7s	3324.7	 that some children are naturally gifted, and build a connection to social justice. Critics say math
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3331.2s	3331.2	 shouldn't be political. Well, of course, the way that those articles always written, it's always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3335.4s	3335.4	 about the backlash, you know, they don't talk about what what the people in charge are trying to do to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3340.7s	3340.7	 basically degrade the curriculum, of course, there's a backlash because parents don't like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3344.5s	3344.5	 what the people on these school boards are doing. This was the sleeper issue in Virginia was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3349.4s	3349.4	 school board issue, you had your parents were already angry that the teachers unions that kept
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3354.8s	3354.8	 the schools closed for a year and a half during COVID. And while their kids were at home, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3361.0s	3361.0	 work doing classes over zoom, parents got a good look at what some of their kids were learning,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3364.9s	3364.9	 and then like what they saw. I mean, we're talking about lessons plans that incorporated CRT,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3369.9s	3369.9	 and you know, the 1619 project view of America singling out kids by the race, making them focus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3375.3s	3375.3	 on difference. And then there were some, you know, rather explicit materials at young grade levels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3381.0s	3381.0	 about, you know, LGBT issues. And so this led to a whole bunch of confrontations of school board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3386.1s	3386.1	 meetings where parents of all races objected to, you know, the least lesson plans for their kids.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3393.0s	3393.0	 And the school boards and administrators just dismissed their complaints out of hand. And,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3397.0s	3397.0	 you know, their message was, well, we're not teaching CRT to your kids. But if we were,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3401.3s	3401.3	 it's a good thing and only white supremacists would object. So, you know, that was sort of what was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3407.3s	3407.3	 happening in the background. And then McAuliffe comes along and makes this gigantic gaffe in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3412.3s	3412.3	 last debates about two weeks for the election where he says, I don't think parents should be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3416.3s	3416.3	 telling the schools what to teach. And yes, this is the customer. No, he said that on a debate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3423.4s	3423.4	 And he said that debate about two weeks for the election. McAuliffe was leading through this whole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3426.7s	3426.7	 thing until that debate, where and this was sort of a Kinsley gaffe in the sense that, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3431.9s	3431.9	 Michael Kinsley said a gaffe is when a candidate inadvertently says something true. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3437.6s	3437.6	 this is McCall's view is that the teachers union should be controlling the schools, not the parents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3442.0s	3442.0	 well. Yes. So this is what Yonkin jumped all over all of his ads in the last two weeks of campaign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3449.9s	3449.9	 really focused on this issue. You know, pour gasoline on a fire. And then the most tone deaf
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3455.6s	3455.6	 thing McAuliffe did is he had Randy Weingarten, who is the head of the big teachers union come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3461.3s	3461.3	 in and campaign for him at the 11th hour. Well, of course, that's not going to save him because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3465.0s	3465.0	 people are sick and tired of the teachers unions. So, you know, this was basically the big sleeper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3470.6s	3470.6	 issue CRT and the schools in Virginia. And, you know, this is this I think specifically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3479.4s	3479.4	 is what the Democratic Party has to wake up to is that these progressive ideologies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3483.5s	3483.5	 are not popular. The other thing I'll say about Glenn Yonkin is that this is another thing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3487.8s	3487.8	 the that the republicans should hopefully pay attention to, which is you can look normal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3493.7s	3493.7	 act normal, be normal. You know, this is not an extremist in any way. This guy was the co CEO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3500.3s	3500.3	 of Carlisle, which is a huge and very successful private equity firm. So this is a very rational,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3506.4s	3506.4	 reasonable person who, you know, didn't embrace anything that was really that pro Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3513.5s	3513.5	 And that should be a real wake up call to the republicans, which is hey, let's just run a fleet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3518.2s	3518.2	 of normal people. I think what you saw, I think your mouth is right that what you saw in Virginia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3523.7s	3523.7	 is that the playbook that Gavin Newsom just used to defeat the recall in California did not work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3529.8s	3529.8	 in Virginia, which is he tried to paint Yonkin as a Trump proxy. And Yonkin very definitely,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3537.7s	3537.7	 you know, avoided that he got Trump's yes, he got Trump's endorsement, but very early in the process,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3542.6s	3542.6	 he did not have Trump come to the state. And you'd have to say it also helped Yonkin a lot that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3548.2s	3548.2	 social media that Trump wasn't all over social media because he's been banned. So you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3552.8s	3552.8	 in a weird way, Facebook and Twitter deserve an assist here, because they help keep Trump out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3557.8s	3557.8	 the Virginia race. So you know, this playbook that that Newsom defined that worked very effectively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3564.3s	3564.3	 from California, which is simply to keep running against Trump, I think Democrats thought they'd
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3568.7s	3568.7	 be able to win elections for years based on that that playbook didn't even last two months. So you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3573.7s	3573.7	 know, so I think Democrats are gonna have to find a new playbook here. Okay, so Friedberg,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3579.6s	3579.6	 on this California issue around education, one of the key or most controversial concepts is detracking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3587.4s	3587.4	 in other words, instead of having high performing students go to a high performing track,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3591.8s	3591.8	 and then everybody else stay behind, maybe keeps in not all cases, but keep some of the students
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3596.7s	3596.7	 together because there is some research that shows if done right. If you track people together,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3602.4s	3602.4	 the higher performing students will pull up the ones who are slightly behind. Other people say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3608.6s	3608.6	 we're basically throttling people who could be the next Einstein or the next world class leader
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3615.0s	3615.0	 in science, math, etc. Any thoughts on the concept of detracking since I'm assuming you were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3620.9s	3620.9	 in the high speed track in science and math?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3625.4s	3625.4	 Maybe we should get rid of like, JV and varsity sports teams as well. And, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3631.9s	3631.9	 triple A baseball and Major League Baseball as well. And, you know, any distinction of performance,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3638.2s	3638.2	 or exceptionalism goes away. You know, and that is kind of the key social question is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3645.8s	3645.8	 are we going to give up exceptionalism to minimize the distance between the exceptional and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3653.1s	3653.1	 average? And that seems to be what's happening. It makes people feel bad. But I've said this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3657.2s	3657.2	 point before, you know, we're doing it when we try and think about, you know, the billionaire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3661.4s	3661.4	 tax or what have you. As soon as you start to limit progress, you reduce inequality,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3668.6s	3668.6	 but you limit progress. And the same will be true not just in science, not just in business,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3674.6s	3674.6	 but also in sports and athletics and any other kind of system where you will have exceptionalism,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3681.4s	3681.4	 you will have an average, you will have a distribution amongst human performance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3686.4s	3686.4	 And as soon as we try and limit the difference in that distribution,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3691.4s	3691.4	 we move the entire curve to the left. Here's the counter Friedberg. What some studies have shown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3699.0s	3699.0	 is yes, you will throttle the high performers. But we're seeing a long race lines, certain

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3710.4s	3710.4	 values question, right? Like, do you think that individual freedom and the opportunity to pursue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3715.3s	3715.3	 your opportunity, your exceptionalism should be taken away from you, such that others who aren't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3722.5s	3722.5	 as exceptional as you are given, you know, greater progress than they would have had on their own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3728.7s	3728.7	 And that's the key crux of what all of these social systems are grappling with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3732.8s	3732.8	 whether it's in sports or business or finance or, or, or education is what's the right thing to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3740.6s	3740.6	 And that ethics question is going to be defined by the social agenda of the moment. And you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3744.8s	3744.8	 the means of the moment and what we all think is the right thing to do. And it's different all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3749.0s	3749.0	 over the world. And it's different within political systems. But it's a very divisive point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3753.4s	3753.4	 that I think folks who find themselves on one end of that exceptional spectrum in different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3757.8s	3757.8	 aspects are going to have one point of view and folks on the other end of that exceptional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3761.7s	3761.7	 spectrum are going to have other points of view. And everyone's going to be sensitively tuned to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3765.1s	3765.1	 where they fall in that spectrum. I will say one thing, though, on that spectrum, exceptionalism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3770.2s	3770.2	 is rarer than the average. Therefore, it is likely the case that over the next years and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3775.3s	3775.3	 decades, we will see the, the idea that we should remove exceptionalism in business and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3780.4s	3780.4	 exceptionalism in education and exceptionalism in sports, because it benefits the majority.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3786.7s	3786.7	 And, and no one kind of recognizes and a lot of folks don't recognize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3791.3s	3791.3	 the progress that is made by exceptionalism. And, and that's, and then we're going to wake up one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3796.2s	3796.2	 day and be like, Oh, wait a second, we don't have the best sports teams winning all the gold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3800.1s	3800.1	 medals. We don't have the smartest kids. We don't have the best businesses, China and Europe and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3805.1s	3805.1	 Brazil and whomever else the emerging markets are going to India are going to start to have them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3809.1s	3809.1	 Such a good point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3810.1s	3810.1	 I think this is a very old debate. It's the debate between a quality of opportunity and a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3814.3s	3814.3	 quality of results. And the progressive left is absolutely obsessed with a quality of results or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3821.1s	3821.1	 outcomes which they now call equity, which is we're going to take people at the finish line and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3825.4s	3825.4	 we're going to move them around. We're going to redistribute the outcomes to achieve a more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3830.5s	3830.5	 proportional representation or something more fair, as opposed to giving everybody as much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3836.6s	3836.6	 opportunity at the outset as possible. That is the fixation right now. That is why they're taking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3841.8s	3841.8	 out advanced math in the schools. They're trying to level people. It's not going to work. It doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3846.4s	3846.4	 lead to a more, we want to have an exceptional society where I think we should be focusing is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3850.6s	3850.6	 creating as much opportunity for everybody. The way to do that would be to let every child go to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3855.8s	3855.8	 school of their choosing so that we would stop trapping kids in bad schools.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3860.5s	3860.5	 But back to bring this back to the election for a second because I think it was a very clear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3865.3s	3865.3	 repudiation of this progressive mindset. I think there's essentially two sets of reactions to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3871.3s	3871.3	 If you look at all the left-wing commentators, the one who I thought seemed to get it the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3878.7s	3878.7	 was CNN's Van Jones actually had, I thought, a rare moment of introspection where he said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3886.9s	3886.9	 the results were a five-alarm fire. He said it was a big, big wake-up call for the Democrats to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3891.8s	3891.8	 stop annoying voters with woke hectoring. He actually advised Biden to start triangulating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3897.6s	3897.6	 against the woke left in the way that Bill Clinton did, which is something that I've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3901.9s	3901.9	 been suggesting on this pod. You're saying something super important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3905.5s	3905.5	 The game theory now is for Biden to put to the test the progressive left because now he can go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3912.1s	3912.1	 firmly to the center and he can put all of the pressure on the progressive left in the House and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3920.2s	3920.2	 Warren and Bernie Sanders in the Senate. Well, he's right. That's the first thing he should do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3927.3s	3927.3	 He should pull a sister soldier on Bernie Sanders. He can't keep delegating the domestic agenda to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3932.8s	3932.8	 Bernie Sanders. If he wants to save his presidency, he'll start triangulating in the way that Bill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3937.0s	3937.0	 Clinton did. I'm not sure he's going to. I think there's already a misperception that the reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3942.5s	3942.5	 why they lost this election is because they didn't deliver the goodies in this House reconciliation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3948.2s	3948.2	 bill. I don't think the public cares about the goodies. They care about this normalcy and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3953.7s	3953.7	 centrism. There's a part of the Democratic base that does want what's in that House reconciliation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3959.5s	3959.5	 bill. But here's the thing. Democratic turnout in this election was extremely high. The Democratic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3964.4s	3964.4	 turnout for McAuliffe was higher than the Democratic turnout four years ago for the Democrat who won.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3971.2s	3971.2	 The turnout in New Jersey was higher than what Murphy got four years ago when he won. The problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3977.4s	3977.4	 the Democrats have is that Republican turnout was extremely high, even without Trump, showing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3982.4s	3982.4	 Trump doesn't matter that much to turnout. The independents came out in a big way for Republicans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3989.5s	3989.5	 This idea that Democrats can just win elections by delivering programs for their base,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=3996.5s	3996.5	 that's not going to work. I think that's a misperception. I think Van Jones has the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4000.4s	4000.4	 right idea. They need to triangulate. But you turned the channel to MSNBC, and they were just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4005.1s	4005.1	 blaming the whole thing on white supremacy. Oh, God. They were basically hysterical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4008.2s	4008.2	 Just on the detracking thing, this shows to me a severe lack of creativity. If you look at what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4014.7s	4014.7	 happened in the NBA, they had this developmental league, which they didn't run and then became the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4018.6s	4018.6	 G League. They now have the ability to bring players fluidly from the Warriors G League team
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4024.4s	4024.4	 up to the Warriors or the Knicks team up to the Knicks. What this means is you don't have to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4029.4s	4029.4	 there's two different tracks and the two never shall meet in the season, they can move up and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4034.4s	4034.4	 down. In math, a very easy solution to this would be to have the high track for high performers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4040.2s	4040.2	 have the regular track and then spend with all this money we have, say, hey, every school is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4044.8s	4044.8	 going to be open from three to five o'clock, four days a week. If anybody wants to attempt to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4050.8s	4050.8	 into a higher track of math, just stay after school for two hours, anybody can go and get one on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4055.8s	4055.8	 one tutoring and just double the number of teachers, the whole country wants excellence,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4061.3s	4061.3	 they don't want leveling, they don't want equity, they don't want quality of results, they want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4065.1s	4065.1	 have a quality of opportunity. They want other people to move up. They do want to see that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4069.8s	4069.8	 true. And that's students and immigrants do better at math. That's what you're missing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4073.8s	4073.8	 Yes. And that's about equality of opportunity. Absolutely. No, it's not just about equality of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4077.4s	4077.4	 opportunity. They're so far behind statistically, that you need to do something new. What we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4081.6s	4081.6	 doing is not working, David. That's why people are picking this bad. They're, they're, they're,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4087.0s	4087.0	 they are eliminating advanced advanced math, because they don't want to actually look at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4091.3s	4091.3	 problem. What do you see the problem as? Well, if there's an underperformances certain group,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4095.4s	4095.4	 then you should work hard to raise them up, not eliminate the subject. Give me a suggestion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4100.6s	4100.6	 Charters and school choice. Okay, look, if you're if you're going to define structural racism,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4106.7s	4106.7	 as conditions that trap people of color in poverty across generations, seems like a pretty fair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4112.7s	4112.7	 definition, then you have to say the number one cause of structural racism is the school system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4119.5s	4119.5	 It's the school system. Because we know poor kids are trapped in schools that aren't very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4124.4s	4124.4	 Why? Because they're controlled by the education unions. They don't have a choice. They don't have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4128.4s	4128.4	 money. So who is making that argument on the on the side of the left? No one. Why? Because everyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4134.6s	4134.6	 knows the unions, especially the education unions are the number one donor to the Democratic Party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4138.7s	4138.7	 So the Democrats won't even look at this problem. All they'll do is blame white supremacy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4143.6s	4143.6	 Could build their base is by saying, we want to fix education. That would be if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4148.2s	4148.2	 they are. What do you think? Young can just in Virginia, by the way, 55% of Hispanics in Virginia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4154.3s	4154.3	 voted for youngkin. So minorities are shifting on this issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4162.6s	4162.6	 These are the new quality of life issues. If youngkin has a good four years in Virginia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4167.4s	4167.4	 he can run for president and crush this thing. Can I show you just one chart and then we can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4171.0s	4171.0	 get off the politics thing, which is it was this chart from this guy, Patrick Ruffini, who's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4176.5s	4176.5	 pollster. And I think it really illustrates the problem that progresses the Democratic Party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4181.4s	4181.4	 For the lesson. Okay, so what this chart shows is it basically shows where the Democratic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4189.2s	4189.2	 the Democratic Party is in the center Republican Party is in relation to the center of the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4194.2s	4194.2	 Okay. And basically, as you'd expect in a democracy, whichever party is closer to five wins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4200.6s	4200.6	 Okay. So in 1994, when Bill Clinton was president, the Democratic Party, the center of it was smack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4206.8s	4206.8	 dab as five, the Republicans weren't that far away. They were a six. So the party, even though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4211.7s	4211.7	 there is a lot of partisan warfare, the political differences actually weren't that great. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4218.1s	4218.1	 Clinton, I think more accurately found that dead center. Okay. Fast forward to 2004. So George W.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4224.4s	4224.4	 Bush is president now, the Democrats are at four, Republicans are at five. That's why Republicans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4229.7s	4229.7	 won. Okay, now go to 2017. This these poll numbers he did. And this is a few years ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4235.2s	4235.2	 the Democrats are all the way at two. Okay, and the Republicans are at six and a half. So it's true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4241.4s	4241.4	 that both parties have moved away from the center. But Republicans are one and a half points away from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4246.2s	4246.2	 the center, whereas Democrats are three points away. So the Democrats have actually moved further
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4250.9s	4250.9	 away from the center. If you look at who are the activists in the Democratic Party, who is the base,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4256.1s	4256.1	 who is the energy, who does all the work, who does the contributions, it is the progressives,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4261.0s	4261.0	 right? This is why McAuliffe ran as McAuliffe is not a progressive. He was the Clinton Democrat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4267.1s	4267.1	 you know, going way back to the 90s. Okay, he was Bill Clinton's, you know, right hand man in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4272.4s	4272.4	 party back in the 90s. But he nevertheless ran as a progressive in Virginia, who supported the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4279.0s	4279.0	 teachers unions. Why? Because he was appealing to the base of the party. Gavin Newsom did the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4283.0s	4283.0	 same thing in California. Gavin was never a Bernie bro. I mean, he's always been liberal, but he has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4288.8s	4288.8	 moved very far left. And Biden has moved very far left as president. Why is that because the base of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4294.7s	4294.7	 the party has moved very far left. So unless that gets fixed, I see maybe a party's base,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4302.3s	4302.3	 but not the country's exactly. So you're going to need a strong Democrat who can basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4307.6s	4307.6	 give the Heisman to that part of the base. Or they're going to keep losing elections. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4313.0s	4313.0	 this could be a Republican decade. I know it doesn't seem like it right now, because you had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4316.8s	4316.8	 Trump and the Republicans lost. But look how quickly the Republicans turned around their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4321.2s	4321.2	 electoral fortunes. So Trump shows up, then that's just a huge detriment. Yes. If Trump is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4328.3s	4328.3	 nominee in 2024, all bets are off. But in 2022, he's not the nominee. He's still censored from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4334.5s	4334.5	 social networks. He's really nowhere in sight. And people, people have a very short memory,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4341.5s	4341.5	 it turns out they've moved on very quickly. Young can check the box because he felt he had to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4346.7s	4346.7	 to get the nomination and to run on the Republican platform. But then you think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4351.9s	4351.9	 young kids going to talk to Trump once? No, not one. And I think and I honestly think this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4357.3s	4357.3	 election is going to help Republicans move past Trump because what Republican believes in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4362.6s	4362.6	 in like that the electoral system is rigged now. Right? I mean, all these blue cities and states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4367.8s	4367.8	 just delivered big results for Republicans. So where exactly is the ballot stuffing? Where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4372.6s	4372.6	 exactly is the stall? Where are the stolen elections? That's gonna that's gonna stop now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4377.0s	4377.0	 too. They're gonna stop overnight, right? Because I mean, by the way, Kristin Sinema probably knows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4381.8s	4381.8	 this, like, you know, the funny thing about all of this is when Peter Thiel put in $10 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4386.3s	4386.3	 into this pack for Blake Masters, who used to work for him, and said, you know, in Arizona,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4391.6s	4391.6	 I'm going to run this guy against you. Sinema attacked hard to the center. Instantly. So she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4398.2s	4398.2	 knew to. Yeah, well, so just small point of correction, Blake is running against the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4403.1s	4403.1	 guy, the astronaut guy, I'm spacing on his name. But but yeah, but but Sinema is up, so to speak,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4409.4s	4409.4	 in the next election cycle. So she got a little bit more time. But you're right, like Sinema is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4413.8s	4413.8	 attuned and mansion is attuned. They are some of the few Democrats that are attuned to where the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4419.6s	4419.6	 center of the country is. You heard Manchin in the wake of this election said this is a center
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4423.8s	4423.8	 right country, these guys better wake up. You know, they should really now look, I think I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4428.6s	4428.6	 what's going to happen in the wake of this election is that this infrastructure bill is going to sail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4432.7s	4432.7	 through. Because one of the crazier things that the progressives were doing was holding that bill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4436.6s	4436.6	 hostage. It might help McAuliffe. I don't think what I don't think McAuliffe would have won, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4441.8s	4441.8	 it might have helped him by a point or two if they had gotten that infrastructure bill done,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4445.4s	4445.4	 because a lot of those programs are going to be popular in a state like Virginia. Okay, but I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4451.0s	4451.0	 think that this House reconciliation bill, they just seemed hell bent on jamming it through with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4455.1s	4455.1	 all these tax increases. I don't think that's not popular. You know, the big issue in New Jersey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4461.4s	4461.4	 one of the big issues in New Jersey where you almost had this upset within one point was taxes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4467.2s	4467.2	 There was a gaffe by Murphy, who said something like, he said that if taxes are someone's chief
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4474.9s	4474.9	 concern, he said, quote, maybe we're not your state. Can you imagine that? Wow. And he almost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4480.0s	4480.0	 lost the election because of that. So I don't think all these big tax increases are what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4484.2s	4484.2	 country wants. And you know, if Biden insists on allowing Bernie to dominate the agenda and Warren,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4491.3s	4491.3	 I think it's good, you're going to see 40 to 50 seat losses by the Democrats in 2022.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4497.3s	4497.3	 Okay, moving on to our final topic, crazy update out of China, a research team has developed a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4504.2s	4504.2	 method of converting carbon dioxide into starch science magazine published this paper from a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4510.9s	4510.9	 research team 100 grams of catalyst converting five grams of co2 per hour into starch. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4519.1s	4519.1	 freeburg, I saw you tweeted that this is 10 times more efficient than corn plants. What's the impact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4525.4s	4525.4	 of something like this? Could it hit scale? Would it have an impact on food security, carbon,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4533.1s	4533.1	 global warming? Yeah, so I tweeted this paper out because it's just it's a fantastic demonstration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4539.3s	4539.3	 of what's possible in this new emerging, not emerging, it's been around for a long time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4544.2s	4544.2	 but kind of, you know, in the state of art in, in bio manufacturing, you know, photosynthesis is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4551.0s	4551.0	 system by which most starch is produced on planet Earth today, that is plants convert sunlight,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4556.8s	4556.8	 and use water and carbon dioxide to make starches and starches. And, and, and sugars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4562.8s	4562.8	 which are what carbohydrates are, account for 60% of human calories. And we get all those calories
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4568.7s	4568.7	 from rice, wheat, potatoes, which, you know, are grown on about 60% of our acres that we farm on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4574.4s	4574.4	 planet Earth. So you know, in plants, there's a series of these chemical reactions. And what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4579.0s	4579.0	 these guys did is they isolated and created a couple of specific proteins, which are a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4588.2s	4588.2	 class of proteins called enzymes. And what an enzyme is, is it's a protein that can take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4592.3s	4592.3	 different molecules and combine them and reinforce them to react and make something new. And they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4597.7s	4597.7	 identified a couple of enzymes and engineered a few enzymes and put them together in a cell free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4602.4s	4602.4	 system, meaning there's no cells involved. It's just a tank with a bunch of fluids in it. And,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4607.9s	4607.9	 and they stick in some carbon dioxide that they can suck in from the atmosphere and they,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4613.1s	4613.1	 they can, and they have to drive it with some hydrogen gas, which we can just get from water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4618.2s	4618.2	 And the system basically converts that carbon dioxide into starch, which is being done at a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4624.6s	4624.6	 rate that's almost 10 times higher than what we see with, with corn plants. So it's, it's an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4630.0s	4630.0	 incredible demonstration. There's, there's several steps to the system, like six steps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4634.3s	4634.3	 And I did some back of the envelope math and my back of the envelope math on what they've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4637.9s	4637.9	 demonstrated. And by the way, everything they did is publicly available for reproducibility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4643.0s	4643.0	 So people are going to try and open source, open source. So people are going to try and copy this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4646.3s	4646.3	 now. But my back of the envelope math is, you know, this system can produce about 10 grams of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4654.2s	4654.2	 starch per liter per day, which would mean it would take about 2.7 trillion liters to suck up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4661.8s	4661.8	 all of the carbon dioxide that all of humans are putting in the atmosphere every year from all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4666.7s	4666.7	 industry. That would require about 27 million tanks that are about 40 feet tall and about eight feet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4673.1s	4673.1	 wide. That whole, all of those tanks could fit in an area about 25 by 25 miles. You could attach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4679.4s	4679.4	 one nuclear reactor to it to suck up the, the water and convert it into hydrogen gas and feed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4685.1s	4685.1	 this system. And those tanks 25 miles by 25 miles would take out all of the carbon dioxide on planet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4692.9s	4692.9	 earth and convert it into usable starch. And that starch, by the way, that system could be tuned,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4697.3s	4697.3	 not just to make starch for consumption. It could be used to make biofuels. It could be used to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4702.3s	4702.3	 bio plastics. It could be used to make anything that's hydrocarbon based. And so you can kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4707.6s	4707.6	 think about this being the entry point to a series of production systems that we could use to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4712.2s	4712.2	 stuff. Why, Friedberg, why did they open source it? So they're a research team of scientists from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4717.8s	4717.8	 China, and they've been iterating on this, this process. This isn't the only process, right? And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4724.2s	4724.2	 so what they're showing is that this is possible. And what I think we will see is a lot of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4729.8s	4729.8	 rattling their brains now saying, not only do we use proteins and enzymes that we find in nature,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4735.0s	4735.0	 but we're going to start to engineer our own proteins and our own enzymes that are even more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4738.9s	4738.9	 efficient than what we see in nature. And that's what's starting to happen. This system alone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4743.4s	4743.4	 what I just described, this 25 mile by 25 mile system, which is tiny, is the equivalent of

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4754.0s	4754.0	 it's 42 times that is what it would produce. That's my back of the envelope math of kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4758.2s	4758.2	 what these guys did. And so I think what they're showing is this is possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4761.6s	4761.6	 I mean, what's incredibly... Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4763.3s	4763.3	 Yeah. And then the implications, we could go in a hundred directions and we could talk for an hour
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4767.7s	4767.7	 about what this means and what you could do with it. But I think it really catalyzes this point that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4774.1s	4774.1	 we're kind of... Everyone's always like, how are we going to get all this carbon out of the atmosphere?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4777.5s	4777.5	 What are we going to do with this? Where there's a will, there's a way. The science is here today.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4790.7s	4790.7	 put a nuclear power plant there and you could suck up all the CO2 in the atmosphere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4795.0s	4795.0	 Anybody want to take a guess of how many people on the team were in advanced math courses?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4801.2s	4801.2	 The funny thing about this that I think is really interesting is that it came at the same week where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4805.6s	4805.6	 we were ending what was this political theater of COP26. Greta Thunberg, who's...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4813.8s	4813.8	 How dare you? How dare you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4817.8s	4817.8	 She had this very funny comment, which is like, it was a bunch of corporate nonsense and the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4822.7s	4822.7	 old blah, blah, blah, was her description of COP26. We had this great trickle of agreements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4830.5s	4830.5	 There was on Monday, there was an agreement to stop deforestation. Then you realized it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4836.2s	4836.2	 non-binding agreement and you're like, oh, okay, well, I guess we're not going to stop deforesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4840.6s	4840.6	 We're just going to keep doing that. All of this stuff just took a lot of my enthusiasm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4848.2s	4848.2	 and I was a little despondent about what was going on. Then when I saw this thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4852.3s	4852.3	 I was really quite impressed. I will say that there's a very tricky thing happening right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4857.7s	4857.7	 which is that developing countries basically said, listen, if you want us to go after climate change,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4863.6s	4863.6	 we want $1.3 trillion a year to support us. The Western world will have to figure out whether
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4870.6s	4870.6	 we're willing to pay what is the equivalent of 6% or 7% of US GDP to a whole bunch of other countries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4877.0s	4877.0	 every year for them to slow down. If we don't make these payments to India and China and a bunch of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4882.6s	4882.6	 other developing nations, they have said we're just going to continue to do what we're going to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4887.0s	4887.0	 Here's an idea. Take half of that money and put it towards science.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4890.0s	4890.0	 Yeah, take half that money and go build a plant that uses this system that was just demonstrated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4894.6s	4894.6	 and put it in South Texas and suck up ocean water and convert that ocean water into hydrogen gas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4899.6s	4899.6	 Trade jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4900.5s	4900.5	 By the way, ocean water can be turned into hydrogen gas by running electricity through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4904.6s	4904.6	 You're putting a nuclear power plant to make the electricity. You run it through ocean water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4907.8s	4907.8	 You create hydrogen gas. You pump it into these frigging tanks and it sucks up all the CO2 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4912.6s	4912.6	 it makes stuff that humans can consume and that we can use. Suddenly, you have this abundance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4916.9s	4916.9	 of material. You have this abundance of food and jobs and you can turn this into a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4923.0s	4923.0	 different things. This goes to the point I've been making for a while. If we want to invest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4927.4s	4927.4	 in infrastructure, this is the sort of thing that both solves climate change, creates jobs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4932.6s	4932.6	 and has extraordinary economic return potential built into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4937.1s	4937.1	 How does it get politicians re-elected?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4939.9s	4939.9	 I think the private market may come after this stuff. I'll be honest. I'm talking to people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4944.0s	4944.0	 looking at this being like, why don't we make a plant that we can make biofuels and bioplastics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4947.8s	4947.8	 and food and other stuff out of this technique. There's going to be other iterations of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4951.9s	4951.9	 technique, but it's such a no-brainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4953.5s	4953.5	 What would a prototype cost? A functional prototype of this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4957.6s	4957.6	 A small prototype? Nothing. A couple million bucks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4960.3s	4960.3	
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4960.4s	4960.4	 Yeah, nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4962.7s	4962.7	 The other thing that happened this week beyond this request for $1.3 trillion is that we're now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4968.0s	4968.0	 seriously considering carbon tariffs. We talked about this on a pod before, but I've said I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4973.8s	4973.8	 this is the most disruptive thing in the capital markets and geopolitics that can happen in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4978.6s	4978.6	 next 10 or 20 years is an effective carbon tariff, which is to say that when a good or service
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4983.3s	4983.3	 enters the borders of a country, they will levy some tax that they think represents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4988.6s	4988.6	 its drag on the environment. The simple example would be a car. You make a car, you make a Tesla
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=4997.8s	4997.8	 in Texas, but the minute it crosses the border to Canada, Canada says, well, here's the true carbon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5004.2s	5004.2	 intensity of this car, all of the energy that you put into the aluminum, to the batteries,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5010.6s	5010.6	 to the buildings where the engineers sat that were building FSD. I'm going to charge an 8,000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5018.4s	5018.4	 dollar tax on this car. Or iPhones coming out of China. Yeah, that's happening. I think that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5023.9s	5023.9	 coming. So I think that the combination of tariffs and these transfer payments is going to create a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5030.0s	5030.0	 real economic incentive for folks to make these kinds of big technological leaps. So I'm pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5035.0s	5035.0	 bullish on all of that. I'm less bullish on politicians ability to organize because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5040.2s	5040.2	 unfortunately, again, this is the first time I really paid attention to COP. And it just looked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5045.0s	5045.0	 like a bunch of really, you know, political theater. It's just a lot of political theater.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5050.2s	5050.2	 Sax, is this a science conversation about saving the planet? Do anything for you? Would you like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5053.9s	5053.9	 to get back? I mean, I think it's the way to solve the problem is you have to figure out new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5058.1s	5058.1	 technologies to actually take carbon out of the atmosphere because you're not going to do it through,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5063.0s	5063.0	 you know, these political programs. I mean, you know, China, India, paying them and other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5070.0s	5070.0	 developing nations 1.3 trillion a year. I mean, foreign aid already is one of the least popular
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5075.3s	5075.3	 parts of the government's budget. You're going to now pay 1.3 trillion to these countries so that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5081.8s	5081.8	 they it's nonsense. And you're going to pay that money into our education system. Nobody's going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5086.3s	5086.3	 stand for that technology that solves the problem. Nobody's going to stand for that. Yeah. And you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5090.6s	5090.6	 know, the taxes education system, right? Pour it in. Yeah, I don't think there's a political
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5096.2s	5096.2	 solution to this problem that's gonna be palatable to people. I think it's gonna have to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5100.1s	5100.1	 solved through new technology. Now, let me ask you a question for your bird. You said there's a six
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5104.6s	5104.6	 step process. Given your experience building science and technology products, is it possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5110.5s	5110.5	 for each of those six steps to get but 20% more efficient a year? Yeah, look, I mean, I just say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5117.6s	5117.6	 that to describe that there's a series of steps in the system, you know, but at the end of the day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5123.0s	5123.0	 this is a demonstration of science that has been, you know, probably funded to some small amount.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5129.0s	5129.0	 But you know, if you start to iterate on this approach, and think big picture and think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5132.9s	5132.9	 infrastructure solution here, there's a lot of room for improvement, I'm sure. So in other words,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5137.6s	5137.6	 your back of the envelope 25 by 25 mile, if this is getting 50% more efficient, 25% more efficient
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5144.2s	5144.2	 year over year, we could see it becoming, you know, twice as efficient every two to three years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5150.1s	5150.1	 And your 25 mile might be a five mile radius city. I mean, think about going to Mars, right? What
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5154.3s	5154.3	 are we going to do in Mars? We're not going to grow grow friggin fields of corn and grow cows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5158.9s	5158.9	 and stuff, right? You're going to need a system that literally takes the molecules that are in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5163.0s	5163.0	 the atmosphere, they're using some electricity that's probably going to be produced by a nuclear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5166.4s	5166.4	 power plant, and convert those molecules into what you want to make and consume. And that's what we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5171.2s	5171.2	 can do on Earth today. The systems are going to get better, they're going to get cheaper, they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5175.0s	5175.0	 going to get faster. And that's why I'm highly optimistic about solutions to climate change in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5179.8s	5179.8	 the century. It's not about an if it's about a when and you know, the when is going to be defined
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5184.8s	5184.8	 by the willpower of how we are going to allocate our people and our capital resources to solve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5189.2s	5189.2	 these problems in the near term, we have the tools to do it. I love the fact that we're sort of hitting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5193.8s	5193.8	 this fork in the road where it's like, do we just want to give the money to a bunch of governments

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5208.3s	5208.3	 right? What'd you say? I think the former
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5212.6s	5212.6	 we should Yeah, let's give it to politicians who don't know what the fuck they're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejW4f6liOS8&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=81&t=5215.8s	5215.8	 I mean, it really is like when you know, I don't know if he's right, you on say like,
