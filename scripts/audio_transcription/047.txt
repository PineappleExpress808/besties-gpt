https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=7.4s	7.4	 Oh, family. Have you met him? What were they like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=13.3s	13.3	 Are they everything you're expecting? I had to meet the new kid. He's 19. What's his major?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=30.2s	30.2	 Hey, everybody. Welcome to another episode of the All In Podcast. Yes, we made it to episode 47
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=46.2s	46.2	 in three episodes. It'll be episode 50. No plans to do anything other than just try to record this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=51.6s	51.6	 every week for you, the loyal audience with us again, coming off an amazing event, a live event
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=58.8s	58.8	 on Monday, Tuesday, and I don't know if it went into Wednesday, but David Freeberg's the production
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=63.6s	63.6	 board event. We recorded our first live All In it seems like it went well on an AV basis and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=70.6s	70.6	 audience seemed to enjoy it. What was the feedback? Freeberg? So you know, half the room were scientists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=75.9s	75.9	 and they've never heard of this podcast before. And they were like, what the hell did we just show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=79.9s	79.9	 up to? It's like these four guys on stage drinking this wine talking about politics for an hour to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=86.1s	86.1	 have. And dropping F bombs. And dropping F bombs and there was a little bit of kind of seasoning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=93.8s	93.8	 we had to do afterwards to get everyone kind of comfortable. But no, actually it was fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=97.8s	97.8	 People loved it. You guys are the highlight. And I thought it was super fun to do that in person. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=102.1s	102.1	 don't know what you guys thought. It's cool energy. It's super cool energy. And with us again, of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=107.3s	107.3	 course, David Sachs, the Rain Man himself and the dictator Chamath Pali Hopatia. What did you think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=115.4s	115.4	 Sachs of the live event format? Obviously, half the audience were fans of the show, half weren't,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=121.8s	121.8	 which is better than putting people randomly into it. But I'm glad that the people who are not fans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=127.7s	127.7	 of or have never heard of the show didn't walk out. We didn't have walkouts. So that was good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=133.0s	133.0	 Sachs? Yeah, I mean, look, we were slightly more palatable to them than Andrew Dice Clay or something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=137.7s	137.7	 like that. But yeah. It was a good change of pace. I mean, I think some people commented that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=166.2s	166.2	 lighting, the production values weren't that great. They seemed fine to us at the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=171.4s	171.4	 But so we're gonna have to do better on that next time. And other people speculated that we took,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=175.6s	175.6	 we're easier on each other in terms of debating topics, because we were in person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=179.8s	179.8	 I didn't feel that while sitting there. But you guys tell me if you think that was true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=185.1s	185.1	 I thought we got a better read on each other in person. And we had more dialogue than we normally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=189.8s	189.8	 would over Zoom. I don't know if you guys felt the same. I think so. And then I kind of like the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=195.7s	195.7	 evening podcast, the glass of wine. I think there's something about it. Like, you're just like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=199.7s	199.7	 little Yeah, you're coming in for a landing. Yeah, coming in for a nice evening, the cards after.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=205.4s	205.4	 It could be a thing. It could definitely be. I could definitely make Harlan 2012 a regular
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=210.6s	210.6	 part of taping this pod. The problem is we taped too early on a Friday, right? If we could change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=215.1s	215.1	 the taping to like happy hour or something like that, it might work better. Oh, my God,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=219.6s	219.6	 Harlan 2012. What is that's a good bottle of wine. Oh, my God. Even J Cal knows that look at him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=226.6s	226.6	 pretending pretending to be a man. That's the it's the one with the round label. I know it. I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=233.3s	233.3	 I'm looking at it right now. Oh, my Lord. Some of those go up in value. Those things are looks like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=237.9s	237.9	 as high as you guys think we could do a pod where we like record after playing poker for two hours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=242.5s	242.5	 So you're two hours into the wine and poker and then you record wouldn't work. No, no way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=247.0s	247.0	 It'd be two. I think the wine poker. Yeah. I think for a first time, the audio was great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=254.0s	254.0	 So that's you know, job one is to get the sound of 99% consumption happens that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=259.1s	259.1	 To do a line of light in Friedberg's face for the first 45 minutes for all commenting. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=264.9s	264.9	 it was my going blind actually got up and fix that like no one else of the crew, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=268.6s	268.6	 the dozens of people working there did anything about it. My wife stood up and fixed the curtain,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=272.6s	272.6	 dude without Al you would be nowhere. Be nowhere in life. She's a great person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=277.8s	277.8	 What was the empty seat about between me and Tramoth? I mean, there was an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=281.4s	281.4	 That was if we wanted to bring up a guest. So all the people's names that were written on that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=286.2s	286.2	 piece of paper are quote unquote besties did not show up on time. Yeah, right. Exactly. No bell girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=293.4s	293.4	 They all showed up at like nine o'clock. Yeah, there's no reason for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=297.6s	297.6	 Yeah, she was the back channel. The back channel was sky dating and somebody else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=302.5s	302.5	 waited outside because they knew they might get pulled up. I got that from I got you have to beep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=307.8s	307.8	 his name out. Yeah, it's your first time saying his name on the no, he's not gonna want his name
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=313.0s	313.0	 mentioned. Are you kidding me? He's been on my pocket. This week in service is one of the first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=316.4s	316.4	 10 guests. That was the last press appearance he did was 11 years ago. He literally does not I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=321.9s	321.9	 everybody knows who's guiding this earthling founder, boy, go founder, everybody of our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=326.1s	326.1	 generation. But it's amazing how, you know, quickly, the tech, the tech crowd, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=332.1s	332.1	 moves on. So true. There's a there's a famous story, actually, when, when Mark Andreessen met
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=337.8s	337.8	 Mark Zuckerberg for the first time, the Zuckerberg didn't know that, you know, Andreessen had created
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=343.4s	343.4	 Netscape. I'm not even sure he knew what Netscape was. I think he said something like I created
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=347.6s	347.6	 mosaic. And he's like, what's that? Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah. So that's like, yeah, look, in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=353.7s	353.7	 tech industry, we're all concerned about the future. No one pays a lot of attention to history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=357.6s	357.6	 Do you feel like last generations, entrepreneurs and investors at this point?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=364.1s	364.1	 Well, some of us are still currently creating things free birth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=372.3s	372.3	 I can't mention the name of the app as per anti promotion rules. But I have recently launched a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=379.9s	379.9	 You could download my redacted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=385.0s	385.0	 But there's not there's not a lot of there's not a lot of kind of long careers in Silicon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=389.7s	389.7	 Valley, right? A lot of people kind of have because creating products. Well, you just kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=394.6s	394.6	 of if you have asymmetric success, right, you have these kind of like big bursts. And then,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=398.9s	398.9	 you know, it's a it's a different kind of life, you don't go kind of push again for the next hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=402.9s	402.9	 entrepreneurial project, typically, not everyone, obviously. And then you end up seeing like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=407.9s	407.9	 generation kind of die out like, you know, web 1.0 and web 2.0. And then you know, you don't see them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=412.2s	412.2	 again. You also see them. Yeah, I think I think there's a lot of truth to that that you and I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=421.0s	421.0	 worry about this with my own kids that I think deprivation creates motivation, especially to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=425.8s	425.8	 something as hard as create a company, create a startup, create motivation. Welcome to David
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=433.0s	433.0	 Sachs's infomercial. No, no, I mean, look, I think you know, thank you for coming to my tent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=442.0s	442.0	 You know, beep beep beep beep. Our friend beep has a has a saying that that sort of became famous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=449.9s	449.9	 when Elon then repeated it, which is that creating a startup is like steering into the abyss and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=454.0s	454.0	 eating glass. And it is really hard to create these companies when they're successful. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=458.7s	458.7	 not a lot of people want to do it again, once they've reached that point. And, you know, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=464.2s	464.2	 does take a certain amount of, like I said, deprivation, you know, to do this, which is why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=470.2s	470.2	 giving everybody the participation trophy and trying to make people's lives as easy as possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=474.7s	474.7	 I mean, yes, you want, you don't want to deprive people on the one hand, but on the other hand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=479.7s	479.7	 it does often lead to to good things. Totally agree. We're seeing a bit of a dry run of this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=486.6s	486.6	 people believe that, you know, they have UBI, or the government's going to take care of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=491.9s	491.9	 I would be fine with UBI, you know, everybody getting a little bit of money. And if it was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=497.1s	497.1	 safety net, the only thing I worry about is it seems like a little bit of money, if you're clever,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=501.4s	501.4	 means you could never work. And then what happens to those people in society, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=505.8s	505.8	 Like, well, I just I think it's anti compassionate, because what you do is you kick out the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=509.6s	509.6	 the bottom rungs of the ladder of economic success, when you basically pay able bodied
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=514.5s	514.5	 people not to work. I mean, they need those entry level jobs that may not pay much better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=519.8s	519.8	 than the UBI are an important stepping stone to where they get to next in their career. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=525.0s	525.0	 I think it's it's demotivating. We've already seen in California, we've been doing this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=528.5s	528.5	 UBI is not going to pay you to go to college, but Amazon will, as an example. So you're absolutely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=534.0s	534.0	 right. There's the GI Bill, you know, there's all kinds of examples where in history, we've used,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=539.8s	539.8	 you know, entry level jobs is exactly as they're meant to be an entry level opportunity and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=544.3s	544.3	 on ramp to work your ass off and to make something of yourself if you if you all of a sudden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=550.0s	550.0	 let people opt out of it, then it's going to be a very it's what they're not going to realize is by

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=561.7s	561.7	 Because in activating yourself in your 40s and 50s to essentially start your life is really hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=567.5s	567.5	 I'll give you an example of this. Like, you know, right now, I, you know, I would say I'm like fairly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=572.3s	572.3	 fluent in Italian. That's pretty impressive. But I, but I started taking Italian lessons. And,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=580.4s	580.4	 you know, the last four or 5% of a language is brutalizing, right? Because it's like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=584.6s	584.6	 it's every little grammatical thing, you want to get it completely right. And it's very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=591.4s	591.4	 demotivating for me sometimes, because I'm like, God, why the fuck am I doing this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=595.0s	595.0	 I don't have to I can get it by just speak it. But I've made a commitment to myself. Same thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=600.0s	600.0	 in biotech, you know, I got introduced to it by Friedberg and, and obviously, Nat, and,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=605.9s	605.9	 and now I'm trying to learn and it is a it is a grind. And I think it's so easy to quit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=610.9s	610.9	 Now you take that to the extreme and some random person that doesn't have necessarily the ability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=615.0s	615.0	 to fall back on the success that you know, we've all collectively had, and you have to start from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=620.5s	620.5	 scratch. My god, it's it's really tough. It's really tough. At our age, it is just hard. Kids,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=627.8s	627.8	 you're screaming in the background, you're trying to manage all this stuff. It's impossible. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=631.8s	631.8	 you think it's easier when you're in your early 20s? Yeah, be careful what you wish for. But why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=636.4s	636.4	 is it easier when you're in your early 20s? Isn't it always a grind to learn something and push
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=640.6s	640.6	 yourself to develop yourself? I mean, well, you have nothing. So the theory is you have some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=645.7s	645.7	 motivation to get something right? Because you're gonna climb up the mountain because like staying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=650.8s	650.8	 at the shore means you can go watch out to see or something. The tide hours and hours and hours
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=654.5s	654.5	 working hours and hours and hours in my 20s and 30s, like it was like 10 to 16 hour days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=661.1s	661.1	 I couldn't leave the office. Is that different today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=664.6s	664.6	 Yeah, I don't work in the same way I did before because I I'm trying to do a different job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=671.3s	671.3	 But I've earned the right and I now put myself under pressure to do it differently because I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=675.8s	675.8	 have a different job to do. Right. But when I was in my 20s, and I was a PM, you know, grinding out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=680.6s	680.6	 a product or, you know, writing a feature spec or, you know, building a model and trying to put all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=685.0s	685.0	 these things together. It was so much thankless work, I learned a ton. And it was all worth it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=693.4s	693.4	 Right. I was about to ask you, do you regret it or not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=695.6s	695.6	 No, look, this is the thing about work. This is the thing about work life balance that the people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=699.4s	699.4	 are always complaining about people who are working too hard don't realize is that, yeah, you want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=704.2s	704.2	 think about work life balance, but but across your entire life. I mean, one of the things you'll do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=709.1s	709.1	 in your 20s is work much harder to set yourself up to where you want to be in your 50s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=714.2s	714.2	 And so Chamath doesn't have to work as hard in his 50s because he worked much harder earlier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=719.2s	719.2	 in his life. And now he's got the skill set where he can delegate more. So yeah, I think we're,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=724.2s	724.2	 you know, we really shortchange people when we tell them as young people that they don't need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=728.3s	728.3	 to work hard, or in the extreme case of UBI that we're actually paying people not to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=734.3s	734.3	 That's not developing the right habits that are going to make them successful later on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=738.0s	738.0	 And in fairness, though, if you look at minimum wage, and you look at entry level jobs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=742.6s	742.6	 many of them paid too little historically, these companies like McDonald's, I know it's a free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=746.7s	746.7	 market, but we're paying very little, we're talking $7 $8 an hour, and no benefits. And,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=751.9s	751.9	 you know, this is kind of unnecessary greed in my mind. And I think that's what my job was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=756.2s	756.2	 burger. I made 455 an hour. Yeah, I made $4.25 an hour in 1996. That was my first job cleaning,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=763.0s	763.0	 cleaning a pool. Yeah. 250 for me, when I worked at Fordham's, Fordham's computer center, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=770.6s	770.6	 it was four, two, no, three, $3 it had gone to. But when I started in the workforce in 88, it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=775.7s	775.7	 250 was the minimum wage. What was the minimum wage where you are? What was it like in that 19th
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=780.6s	780.6	 century? Yeah, tell us. When I when I when I was working at the fields, no, I remember when I was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=788.0s	788.0	 in college, I worked at a bar. And I mean, I was there drinking so much, I finally was like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=793.5s	793.5	 why don't you just give me a job? So I might as well make some money while I'm sitting here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=798.1s	798.1	 And they paid me seven bucks an hour. That's what I did my senior year. Pretty good. Yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=801.9s	801.9	 pretty good. That's a pretty well paying job. Seven bucks. One of the other problems, but one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=806.6s	806.6	 of the other problems in UBI that Larry Summers has been he's the former US Secretary of Treasury
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=810.6s	810.6	 has been on the record about is the inflationary effect. So you know, they're pretty smart
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=816.2s	816.2	 economists like himself who kind of highlight that as you give people everyone, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=820.6s	820.6	 $10,000 a year, first of all, it's going to cost $10 trillion, whatever the estimate is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=824.8s	824.8	 to kind of fund that sort of program. And, you know, suddenly the cost of a burger goes from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=830.2s	830.2	 49 cents to 99 cents or 99 cents to $1.99. Because there's, you know, much greater demand on that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=836.6s	836.6	 kind of area of the economy for consumption. And so you see an inflationary effect, which trickles
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=843.0s	843.0	 its way through. And so what ends up happening ultimately is by pumping more of that money in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=847.0s	847.0	 for free without productivity coming out of it, you effectively see inflation. And so it wipes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=851.8s	851.8	 itself out. And so this is kind of one economic theory on UBI is that it can actually just end up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=857.4s	857.4	 being within 10 years, completely useless and pointless, because then the basic cost of living
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=862.1s	862.1	 climbs so much that you need to raise the UBI again to give people basic living expenses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=868.2s	868.2	 And so it becomes this kind of nasty runaway effect. So it's not really sustainable,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=872.3s	872.3	 is one argument that's made against UBI. But, you know, obviously different point than what we were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=878.1s	878.1	 kind of saying a moment ago. Anyway, I think people I think people don't know what they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=883.4s	883.4	 And if they get it, they're going to I think of look, a form of a form of UBI does make sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=889.8s	889.8	 And I do think we need to subsidize folks. But you know, I think maybe it's probably just a fancier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=893.9s	893.9	 word for welfare. I grew up on welfare. And I can tell you that I don't think our family benefited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=898.0s	898.0	 from it. Psychologically, we benefited from it socioeconomically, because we needed it to not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=903.4s	903.4	 starve. But the knock on effects of, you know, when you're in that loop of again, being in your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=911.0s	911.0	 30s, 40s and 50s, not finding purpose, you know, which my parents had to struggle through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=916.6s	916.6	 Coping, you cope with alcohol, you cope with depression, the knock on effects to your kids,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=920.9s	920.9	 I don't think we want to see that. And so when people think about UBI, I think they need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=925.9s	925.9	 understand that, you know, we've run a long experiment in this thing called welfare, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=931.1s	931.1	 what welfare does, a lot of us have felt it. And there needs to be a better way. Because if you just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=937.8s	937.8	 let people opt out, I don't think you really understand what happens over long durations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=942.9s	942.9	 of time when you're not doing anything. It's getting really weird right now, right? I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=946.7s	946.7	 the fact that restaurants are closing that have customers, but they can't operate. And so we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=952.8s	952.8	 starting to actually see the effect of it, you know, in some services. What's the open job stat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=956.4s	956.4	 right now? It's like 9 million open jobs in the US. It's been bouncing from eight to 10 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=960.6s	960.6	 Yeah, there's more unfilled jobs and there are unemployed people, right? Yeah. Or unemployment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=966.3s	966.3	 is high, but unfilled jobs is even higher. Yeah, we've somehow moved away from a political consensus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=974.4s	974.4	 we had in the 1990s that I think made a lot of sense when Bill Clinton passed welfare reform with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=980.1s	980.1	 you know, a lot of Republican support is, look, we need to have a welfare system. We need to take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=985.0s	985.0	 care of people who either can't work or can't find a job for a good reason. There needs to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=991.2s	991.2	 a social safety net. But if you're an able bodied person who can find a job, you should be working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=997.0s	997.0	 And that welfare reform they passed in the 90s did lead to a lot of people finding meaningful work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1004.5s	1004.5	 which I think resulted in happier lives. And somehow we've moved off that political consensus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1010.3s	1010.3	 that everyone kind of agrees, yes, social safety net, but able by people should work to now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1014.9s	1014.9	 we have this elite, it's really an elite ideology of UBI, which is, look, we're going to pay people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1020.0s	1020.0	 not to work, which I just think is sort of like un-American. Isn't it also like a little insulting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1026.8s	1026.8	 being like, you know what, don't even bother working, you're making too little money, we'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1029.7s	1029.7	 just give you money. It's, it's, it feels insulting to people's dignity. I'll be honest, like I wouldn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1035.0s	1035.0	 want to take it. I would rather go out and be, I was a waiter or a busboy, I'll go be a waiter or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1039.2s	1039.2	 a busboy and make enough money to pay my rent. And yeah, one of the things you want it for free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1043.8s	1043.8	 Yeah. One of the things you hear is, well, your job is going to be replaced by a machine anyway,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1047.3s	1047.3	 it's not productive work. So why don't we just pay you to sit back and, you know, take yourself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1052.2s	1052.2	 out of the economy? Well, like you said, the unfilled jobs number shows that even with all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1057.4s	1057.4	 the automation that's happening in the economy, and that's a trend that will continue, there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1061.1s	1061.1	 still a need for, you know, human labor. And I think there always will be. And, and it's a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1067.3s	1067.3	 bit too soon to be throwing in the towel on the idea that entire groups of people can't productively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1073.2s	1073.2	 work. Does everybody believe able bodied people should work and not get free money? It's not that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1082.2s	1082.2	 it should or shouldn't. I think the question is what's, what's in folks is best interests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1087.4s	1087.4	 Well, that's what I mean. Yeah, yeah. So is it in best people's best interests? I'll phrase it the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1092.0s	1092.0	 way you're saying is in people's best interests. I think the I think the point where we're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1095.4s	1095.4	 to go wrong is when we couple UBI with actually having to work or not work. And I don't think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1102.2s	1102.2	 that's the right idea. I think we have to do a decent job of letting people find the things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1107.3s	1107.3	 that they want to work on, because everybody can find something that they want to work on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1111.8s	1111.8	 And that shouldn't exclude you or disqualify you from getting UBI so that all that does is then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1117.4s	1117.4	 just raise the general standard of living. I think that idea is better. The problem is when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1123.0s	1123.0	 we talk about UBI, what we are talking about it is in the exact way, Jason, that you said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1128.2s	1128.2	 which is letting people opt out. So I mean, think about how privileged that is to there are places
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1135.0s	1135.0	 in the world where there's not enough jobs. And people are like, wait a second, an American has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1139.4s	1139.4	 to be fulfilled with their job selection. In addition to getting a job. It that just seems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1144.5s	1144.5	 like the height of entitlements. Like, sometimes you just need a job because you need money to pay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1148.2s	1148.2	 your bills, right? But you're saying if you get product, if you get job, job candidate, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1154.7s	1154.7	 citizen fit, you the uptick will be better. UBI is a benefit. It's like universal health care,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1159.2s	1159.2	 we don't we don't make a decision about universal health care based on who does or does not have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1163.0s	1163.0	 job. And so UBI should basically be about evening, you know, the bottom few rungs of economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1170.1s	1170.1	 viability so that everybody has a reasonable ability to have a decent life. That's a nice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1176.1s	1176.1	 idea. I think that makes a ton of sense. But coupling it to having to work or not work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1179.8s	1179.8	 where some people say, Oh, great, I can take this money and not work is the wrong way to figure this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1184.5s	1184.5	 up. We're talking politics, why don't we shift to the the recall? Yeah. All right. So postmortem on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1191.1s	1191.1	 the Newsom recall, he Secretary of State says the recall cost over 300 million, obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1201.0s	1201.0	 Gavin Newsom won in a hold on the 300 million point, let me just take care of this real quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1206.2s	1206.2	 Because I saw this all day on social media. You know what? Yeah, it did cost $300 million. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1212.4s	1212.4	 all the people crying about that clutching their pearls about the 300 million never said a word
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1217.4s	1217.4	 about the 30 billion, the 100 times greater EDD fraud that was perpetrated by our state and by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1225.2s	1225.2	 our one party rule of the state and the recall process and the ballot initiative process is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1229.8s	1229.8	 only check we have on elected leadership in a one party state. So listen, I'll start clutching my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1235.5s	1235.5	 pearls about the 300 million when they start talking about the 30 billion. But look, let's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1240.4s	1240.4	 shift to the result of this. What are you referring to? I'm not sure I know enough about this is this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1245.8s	1245.8	 is the this is the EDD fraud where 30 billion basically went to anyone claiming unemployment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1254.2s	1254.2	 insurance, and 30 billion and fake claims were paid out. That process was poorly administered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1261.3s	1261.3	 So I mean, people were just creating fake addresses, they were descending in claims
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1265.0s	1265.0	 from anywhere and and 30 billion went out. So look, I mean, that's the kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1271.2s	1271.2	 incompetence and corruption that we have in California. So your point is that because it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1275.7s	1275.7	 a single party state where the state where the democrats have supermajority in the assembly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1280.6s	1280.6	 and obviously have the the governorship that the only mechanism for the minority the Republican
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1285.4s	1285.4	 Party is to kind of run recall, not even not the Republicans, just citizens. I mean, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1291.4s	1291.4	 let's remember how the how the recall and the ballot initiative came to be that process,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1297.1s	1297.1	 it actually came from progressives early in the 20th century, who said, we need the people to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1303.2s	1303.2	 some direct democracy because special interests might usurp the the the electoral process and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1311.8s	1311.8	 right and and get control over all these elected representatives. And frankly, that's exactly what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1315.7s	1315.7	 happened in the state of California. But the people who, you know, have that power are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1320.6s	1320.6	 progressives. And so they want to amend or abolish the the recall process. But so look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1325.3s	1325.3	 I think 300 million once every 20 years, to put the fear of God into politicians is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1331.8s	1331.8	 is money well spent, in my view, even if this particular recall wasn't close, there are much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1337.2s	1337.2	 greater examples of waste, fraud and abuse that the people complaining about this should be wanting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1342.6s	1342.6	 to tackle. And I'll believe them about the 300 million when they complain about the 30 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1347.1s	1347.1	 But look, this was a total shellacking for supporters of the recall. And I do think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1352.2s	1352.2	 that whenever you suffered a fee, I think it's important for you to think about what went wrong,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1358.7s	1358.7	 you know, and certainly as a supporter of the recall, I think it's worth doing a post mortem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1364.6s	1364.6	 I think, you know, any political party when it loses needs to do some some introspection and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1369.0s	1369.0	 So what went wrong? Well, I think a couple of things. Okay, so if you if you go back to the polls
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1373.8s	1373.8	 a month ago, or so it was a dead heat, we even had that shock poll that Newsom was down by 10.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1379.8s	1379.8	 And then what happened? Well, the Republican Party basically consolidated their support
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1384.3s	1384.3	 around Larry Elder. Prior to that, you kind of had this amorphous blob of five different candidates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1389.7s	1389.7	 who didn't have a lot of name recognition, they were pretty moderate, they were a hard target for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1394.4s	1394.4	 Newsom to shoot at. Once the Republican Party consolidated around elder provided a very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1400.2s	1400.2	 convenient and rich target for for Newsom to shoot at. And so you'd have to say that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1407.1s	1407.1	 tactically, the Republican Party made it made a mistake there. Now I understand why they did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1411.1s	1411.1	 I mean, elder is smart. He's charismatic. He appeals to that base. But he's not the moderate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1419.8s	1419.8	 candidate that like a Schwarzenegger was or that I you know, Chamath, I wanted you to run. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1425.0s	1425.0	 Falconer was sort of that candidate. And so you kind of had a choice on the Republican side between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1429.5s	1429.5	 a moderate candidate who wasn't very charismatic, which was Falconer, and a very charismatic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1434.0s	1434.0	 candidate who wasn't moderate. And it really played into Newsom's hands. And he was then able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1439.1s	1439.1	 nationalize the election in the wake of that. So he branded, I think somewhat unfairly, he branded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1444.4s	1444.4	 elder as a as a Trump er, and he ran against Trump ism. And even Biden came to California to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1450.6s	1450.6	 denounce elder as a Trump clone, which look, there's a lot of things you may not like about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1455.1s	1455.1	 Larry Elder, I don't think it's fair to call him a Trump clone. But that's what they did. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1459.0s	1459.0	 they demonized him. And so if you look at the issues that Newsom ran on, they were all national
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1466.3s	1466.3	 issues. He was, you know, talking about what was happening in Texas with abortion. And he talked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1471.4s	1471.4	 about COVID, we should come back to that one. Because I think that is a state issue, too, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1474.3s	1474.3	 should talk about it. But he started talking about issues that were really more national issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1480.2s	1480.2	 And so the the recall moved away from the issues that had galvanized supporters in the poll just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1485.7s	1485.7	 one polls just one month ago, which were homelessness, crime, schools, and school closures
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1492.7s	1492.7	 and lockdowns. And Newsom was able to very effectively change the subject. Well, he got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1497.6s	1497.6	 everybody back to school, right? If people didn't go back to school, could have been a different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1502.1s	1502.1	 result. I think the recall was very helpful in that in that image. Remember,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1505.7s	1505.7	 do you think policy has shifted because of the recall sacks at this point? And doesn't that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1509.6s	1509.6	 ultimately kind of benefit the issues you were most kind of concerned about? Look, the 300 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1513.9s	1513.9	 was worth it just to get businesses open and just send a message to the the education units that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1519.0s	1519.0	 they could not keep schools closed for another year. I, you know, if you look at when Newsom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1523.6s	1523.6	 relaxed the lockdowns, it was at every step of the recall process when when the recall finally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1528.9s	1528.9	 got enough signatures to get put over the top, he all of a sudden started liberalizing the lockdowns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1533.3s	1533.3	 He knew they were very unpopular and he gave up on that issue. And he got the education unions to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1538.0s	1538.0	 stand down on the issue of school reopenings, I think because he was facing this recall. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1542.8s	1542.8	 look, I think that the recall was worth it just just for that. But do you think things could have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1547.3s	1547.3	 been different if there was a fringe candidate like I don't know, a Sri Lankan billionaire?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1553.6s	1553.6	 That was, you know, not kind of this this hardened Republican that they could charge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1558.0s	1558.0	 and I blame I blame Chamath for this. I think I think a candidate like Chamath could have won,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1562.8s	1562.8	 okay, a Democratic centrist. Obviously, I'm joking. I don't I don't blame you, Chamath. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1567.9s	1567.9	 understand why you wouldn't want to run. But but I'm saying a candidate like Chamath, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1571.8s	1571.8	 who I supported, or a candidate like Schwarzenegger. Remember, Schwarzenegger, when he ran in the early
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1577.1s	1577.1	 2000s, he was pro choice, and pro game gay marriage at a time that gay marriage was not very popular.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1582.8s	1582.8	 He was socially very liberal, you have to take those issues off the table, because California is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1588.1s	1588.1	 not going to vote. He was pro I think he was pro gay marriage before the Clintons. Yes, he was very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1593.4s	1593.4	 early on that. He was he was socially very liberal and very tolerant. And you got to be in California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1599.2s	1599.2	 In general, do you think the unions in California, you know, which is an issue that's been talked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1603.1s	1603.1	 about a lot on this pod have been weakened, because of the recall and the voice that kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1608.1s	1608.1	 rose up during this period of time? Or do you think that nothing's really changed kind of long term?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1613.8s	1613.8	 I think it's I think it's a long term project for to get the public to see that the education unions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1621.2s	1621.2	 are like any special interest, which is that they will pursue their interest at the expense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1626.1s	1626.1	 of the general interest, and they have to be controlled, again, like any special interest,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1630.2s	1630.2	 I think because teachers are rightfully very popular, people haven't realized what the union
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1636.6s	1636.6	 bosses are up to, I think that that has been exposed because of COVID and the school closures
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1642.1s	1642.1	 to a much, much greater degree. And I think that's that's a good thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1645.2s	1645.2	 Well, I mean, if you look at the recalls happening locally, too, with Chesapeake and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1649.4s	1649.4	 the San Francisco School Board, it seems like now the citizenship is saying, Oh, we do have a recourse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1655.4s	1655.4	 It's called doing a recall and stating our opinion very strongly and then attempting to removing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1659.8s	1659.8	 people. And yeah, I think that does change people's behavior. You can be sure Chesapeake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1663.9s	1663.9	 is thinking about outcomes a little bit more now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1665.9s	1665.9	 The implications of this recall, I think are really important. And I think it plays out in who runs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1674.4s	1674.4	 in two years when Newsom is up for reelection. And absolutely, it'll change who runs on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1681.0s	1681.0	 Democratic side in four years, assuming Newsom wins. You have to remember, there have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1688.8s	1688.8	 a massive degradation in the quality of life. The most populous state in America,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1694.8s	1694.8	 which represents the fifth largest economy in the world, under one party control, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1701.7s	1701.7	 So there is not a single law that cannot be passed. There's not a single program that cannot be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1708.7s	1708.7	 implemented. There's not a single idea that can't be pursued. Yet we have had an absolute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1715.6s	1715.6	 decline in quality of life under that rubric. And so when people really come to terms with that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1722.1s	1722.1	 that's I think when there's a sea change. And I hope the sea change is not necessarily a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1726.3s	1726.3	 a Democrat or Republican thing. It's back to centrism. And I think it's checking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1731.0s	1731.0	 special interests, exactly what SAC says and realizing that just because you use a different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1736.3s	1736.3	 name like union or something else, you're still a special interest. And you need to actually be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1742.0s	1742.0	 focused on the interests of the general public, our kids, the environment, water quality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1748.2s	1748.2	 And if you can't walk into a state where everybody up and down the ticket is on your same team and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1753.0s	1753.0	 get shit done, it's a really tough report card. Yeah, I'm just super uninspired by these guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1761.0s	1761.0	 Like, where is their audacious plan for California? Has anybody stated like an audacious like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1765.7s	1765.7	 here's what this state? No, I mean, no, and here's what's possible. We could be the best economy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1771.0s	1771.0	 with the greatest education system, and we can build a million units of housing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1775.0s	1775.0	 Should that be should that be the role of the state government? I mean, like, you know, should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1778.3s	1778.3	 or should the competition they are they're in competition with with Florida and Texas,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1783.1s	1783.1	 they have to compete for business and citizens. And if it's not done at the state level, we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1787.2s	1787.2	 going to have to rely on the federal level. And we know that that doesn't work because we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1791.4s	1791.4	 50 states that are increasingly more diverse every day. So the whole idea with the Constitution and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1798.7s	1798.7	 the founding fathers was like, we have this incredible startup. But over time, I think we've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1803.6s	1803.6	 decided that, you know, this startup is an umbrella organization of 50 other startups,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1809.1s	1809.1	 a holding company, and there'll be these small little, you know, rules and differences amongst
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1814.1s	1814.1	 these 50 states. And that'll allow us collectively to thrive. So I think you put out a tweet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1818.6s	1818.6	 I'm sorry, go ahead. No, I just want to I think we want to believe in that idea. Like, there is no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1822.8s	1822.8	 savior. You know what I mean? There's no savior for 350 people. And there's barely a savior for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1828.2s	1828.2	 the 60 million people in California. But it's not going to happen by just throwing your hands up in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1832.6s	1832.6	 the air and expecting some president to come around because that's just too hard of a problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1836.9s	1836.9	 Each state has to act like the citizens and be, you know, just rugged individualists who are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1842.1s	1842.1	 self sustaining and resourceful. And this state is not self sustaining, resourceful or ambitious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1848.7s	1848.7	 And it's falling behind Texas and Florida and other competitors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1852.1s	1852.1	 So Zach, you were in a competition, you put out a tweet saying often in Miami, are you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1857.2s	1857.2	 are you in the active transition phase? Or where are you at?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1860.6s	1860.6	 Well, I don't know. I mean, we'll see. I think the trend line in California is not good. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1865.1s	1865.1	 what you've already seen in the days since the recall is that Gavin Newsom has now laid out the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1870.3s	1870.3	 strategy for all progressives in like even from San Francisco to anywhere in the country of how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1876.3s	1876.3	 they're going to run and what they're going to do is this, that no matter how bad things get in terms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1881.6s	1881.6	 of crime, in terms of homelessness, in terms of quality of schools, in cities and states that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1887.1s	1887.1	 have complete control over, they're always going to campaign against Trump and Trumpism. And they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1891.9s	1891.9	 going to demonize and otherize whoever the candidate is on the other side as a Trumpist,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1898.2s	1898.2	 whether they are or not, that's going to be the playbook from now on. And this is where I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1902.0s	1902.0	 the attacks against Larry Elder were very unfair is before he even had a chance to define what he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1907.3s	1907.3	 was about. You have publications like the LA Times calling him the new face of white supremacy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1912.7s	1912.7	 I mean, it was like unbelievable, but- Black Klansmen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1916.1s	1916.1	 Yeah, they basically try to make him out to be a black, which look, he is not. Okay. Larry Elder's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1920.2s	1920.2	 a libertarian. Maybe his politics are not in the mainstream in California, but he's not a black
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1924.8s	1924.8	 Klansman. But look, this is what the progressive playbook is going to be for the next two decades,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1929.0s	1929.0	 which is to demonize anybody who stands up to them as basically being a Trumpist. And the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1937.2s	1937.2	 irony of it will be that they will have total control over the problems that people really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1945.4s	1945.4	 care about, crime, schools, homelessness. And somehow, what Newsom proved is that you can whip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1953.5s	1953.5	 people up into, you can stir their partisan political tribalism when you do that. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1960.1s	1960.1	 why it's effective is he gets people to see blue and he gets a free pass on these issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1967.0s	1967.0	 that just a month ago, people were very dissatisfied with. Now, I do think it's very,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1971.6s	1971.6	 very important that our Republican party not play into this. And there was a very good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1976.2s	1976.2	 editorial. I think there's- He was about to say, how come the Republicans are still pursuing a Trumpian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1982.6s	1982.6	 framework? Because they're stupid. They are. I mean, look-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1985.9s	1985.9	 They're so dumb. They're dumb.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1987.8s	1987.8	 It's a really stupid strategy and there's two things they got to fix right away. Okay. So,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1992.6s	1992.6	 number one, Rich Lowry from Nashville Review had a piece in Politico where he said that this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=1997.8s	1997.8	 election, the stolen election myth has become an albatross for Republicans. They have to get off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2004.8s	2004.8	 that. I think it's ridiculous. That's going to bring them down in 2022. And the other thing is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2010.7s	2010.7	 this anti-vax stuff. I mean, voters completely forgot about the way that Newsom locked down this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2017.7s	2017.7	 state and then broke his own lockdowns. Why? Because he's pro-vax even to the point of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2023.2s	2023.2	 vaccine mandates, whereas the Republicans were not. And frankly, I think, Chamath,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2027.9s	2027.9	 your instincts on this were right on, which is people, given a choice between vaccine mandates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2034.0s	2034.0	 or an anti-vax position, they will take the vax mandates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2038.9s	2038.9	 Speaking of instincts, you want to go to the This Week in Facebook's dumpster fire?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2044.0s	2044.0	 Sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2045.2s	2045.2	 Sure. So, I mean, where to begin? This all started on Tuesday.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2056.9s	2056.9	 Okay, well, we'll get to your victory lab in a moment. But just to cue up this past week,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2062.0s	2062.0	 on Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook conducted in-depth research on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2066.8s	2066.8	 impacts of Instagram on children's mental health from 2018 to 2020. But they never made the research
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2072.4s	2072.4	 public nor did they make it available to academics or lawmakers who requested it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2077.6s	2077.6	 You will remember that last year or earlier this year, Facebook started floating the idea of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2083.5s	2083.5	 Instagram for kids. So in addition to having this research, which they didn't share,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2088.0s	2088.0	 and here is the slide from a presentation, it seems like the Wall Street Journal has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2092.6s	2092.6	 somebody inside of Facebook giving them everything literally. But here is the quote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2098.1s	2098.1	 from presentation slides from 2019 internal Facebook presentation slides.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2102.5s	2102.5	 We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls. Teens blame Instagram for increases in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2108.7s	2108.7	 the rate of anxiety and depression. This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2115.6s	2115.6	 according to the Wall Street Journal. And Instagram obviously is a juggernaut over a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2122.8s	2122.8	 billion monthly active users and over 40% of them are under the age of 22.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2127.5s	2127.5	 This is a really interesting issue because we are this is probably the first example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2132.2s	2132.2	 of a broad based public policy public health issue that tech has created, not necessarily amplified,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2141.0s	2141.0	 right, or exacerbated, but actually created it. Now we're going to have to deal with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2146.4s	2146.4	 Before I want to issue is, well, how would you define that issue?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2150.4s	2150.4	 Well, I think it is a public health issue. If you have a large percentage of a cohort of our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2155.7s	2155.7	 population, subject to mental health issues and eating disorders, that's not a good place to be,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2161.7s	2161.7	 right? I don't think that's what we want as a healthy society in a healthy society.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2165.0s	2165.0	 Our daughters and it's probably by the way, it's probably not more than just our daughters is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2168.1s	2168.1	 probably our sons and daughters that are going through these issues. The question is now about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2173.6s	2173.6	 you know, is it really a public health issue? If you know about it, what responsibility do you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2177.9s	2177.9	 have to do something? And before I apply, and I just want to give you guys a little bit of data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2182.4s	2182.4	 and just get your reaction, I actually want to go back to what's called the tobacco master
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2187.4s	2187.4	 settlement agreement. And the tobacco master settlement agreement was entered in November
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2193.2s	2193.2	 of 1998. Originally between the four largest US tobacco companies Philip Morris, RJ Reynolds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2200.9s	2200.9	 Brown and Williamson and L'Oreal. Okay. And the Attorney General's of 46 states. And essentially,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2208.3s	2208.3	 it was an agreement that basically said, Okay, we're going to net all these Medicaid lawsuits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2212.9s	2212.9	 together, we're going to hold these folks responsible for the downstream implications of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2217.4s	2217.4	 the product that they've been selling our kids, and our, you know, adults population without the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2222.5s	2222.5	 proper disclosures, etc, etc, etc. The what happened before this tobacco MSA and big tobacco,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2229.6s	2229.6	 though, was there was about eight or 900 private claims that were filed from the mid 50s, all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2235.8s	2235.8	 way to the midnight. David knows all this, because he made a movie about this. The reason why I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2240.5s	2240.5	 this is interesting is that whether it happens in the United States or someplace else, when I read
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2245.5s	2245.5	 that article, my immediate thought went to the tobacco MSA, because I was like, well, okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2250.6s	2250.6	 there's a public health issue that may or may not have been covered up. Yeah, it's definitely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2254.9s	2254.9	 covered up, there could be criminal liability, there's probably civil liability. If you're,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2260.7s	2260.7	 you know, a mother or father who's lost their kid to an eating disorder or to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2264.7s	2264.7	 depression, anxiety, bullying, suicide. And I think like, I think the article in the Wall
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2270.9s	2270.9	 Street Journal yesterday was about like human trafficking. I mean, these are some gnarly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2275.3s	2275.3	 horribly complicated, gnarly issues. To me, that's how I can edit the dots. So I just love to hear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2281.6s	2281.6	 I mean, who's the Jeffrey Wigand in this case? I mean, this is literally the movie The Insider,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2285.5s	2285.5	 like, somebody is leaking these documents out. There's a deep inside of Facebook. Yeah. Well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2290.5s	2290.5	 yeah, and that's what the Brown and Williamson was really about is that somebody had the studies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2295.4s	2295.4	 from the 70s of when correct me if I'm wrong, David, when the tobacco industry knew
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2300.3s	2300.3	 and did nothing and covered it up, and then they had the whistleblower. So do you feel this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2304.9s	2304.9	 exactly analogous, sacks or how close to analogous are we taking too big of a jump here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2310.1s	2310.1	 Well, this this idea that social media is as bad for you as cigarettes has been around for several
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2314.7s	2314.7	 years now. And I've always wondered whether that was a hyperbolic claim. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2321.5s	2321.5	 it can it really be the case that using Facebook is as bad for you as lighting something on fire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2326.9s	2326.9	 and sucking its carbonized ash into your lungs? I mean, I just, you know, yes, I think there's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2332.7s	2332.7	 a kernel of truth here in terms of yes, it does exacerbate body image issues. But I don't believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2338.3s	2338.3	 that Facebook or social media created those issues. I mean, these issues existed before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2345.2s	2345.2	 And what Facebook does is connect people in a more intense way than they were connected. And so it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2351.3s	2351.3	 might intensify some of the social dynamics that already existed, but I don't know that it created
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2356.7s	2356.7	 them. And if you're going to blame Facebook for this, there's a lot of other places you could blame
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2361.2s	2361.2	 too. I mean, why don't we be why don't we blame the Met Gala, you know, like, you know, look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2367.5s	2367.5	 all those people actually blame on the fashion industry for making unrealistic body types and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2373.1s	2373.1	 the magazines and they sell my kids can't wear the full body stocking to school that Kim Kardashian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2378.7s	2378.7	 wore to the Met Gala or whatever. I mean, and they're upset about that. So should we ban the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2383.0s	2383.0	 Met Gala or I mean, let's look at all advertising. I mean, all advertising just about focuses on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2388.4s	2388.4	 unrealistically beautiful people. And what about TV and movies? I mean, Hollywood tends to cast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2393.9s	2393.9	 people are better looking or even the people reading the news off teleprompters. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2398.6s	2398.6	 so this like body image and self esteem issue is everywhere in our society. And I think what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2404.7s	2404.7	 social media does, as it does in so many of these cases is really just hold up a mirror to our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2410.3s	2410.3	 society. And it's it's not and yes, there's a lot of bad stuff happening on social media. But that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2416.3s	2416.3	 because there's a lot of bad stuff happening in our society. Well, let me I you know, here's one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2420.7s	2420.7	 thing, David, the there there have been other industries that have influenced this, but I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2426.1s	2426.1	 think that they were as pernicious and as frequent in their use of as social media, you know, when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2431.3s	2431.3	 reading a fashion magazine or watching TV, like slightly different than an interactive version
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2436.3s	2436.3	 of that, that you might use for five hours a day, like TikTok or Instagram. And I just dropped in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2441.5s	2441.5	 an image into the zoom chat there about suicide rates in the United States. In this chart, you'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2446.9s	2446.9	 see goes up to 2018. And right around 2006, when we were at 11% 11 suicides, I think per 10,000 per
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2454.1s	2454.1	 100,000, you'll see from 2006 to 2008, we go from, you know, 10 or 11, basically, suicides per 100,000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2464.3s	2464.3	 Americans all the way up to 14, a 40% increase. But what's your evidence correlates directly with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2469.0s	2469.0	 social media becoming part of what we're doing here? But what's your connection to what's happened? I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2473.5s	2473.5	 mean, is that among teens? I mean, what is that? This is overall suicide rates. So I just think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2478.3s	2478.3	 social media and the anxiety of produce could be actually having it. I'm open minded to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2482.7s	2482.7	 Can I clear up one thing, Sachs, I think that your argument would be reasonable if the first part of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2488.8s	2488.8	 your argument made more sense. And to me, it doesn't. And when you don't think that smoking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2495.6s	2495.6	 and looking at your screen for an hour a day are the same, let me just in from my perspective,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2500.8s	2500.8	 explain to you why they are the same, whether or not you're ingesting something into your lungs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2505.1s	2505.1	 or whether or not it's your eyes. At the end of the day, you're still activating physiological
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2510.4s	2510.4	 pathways. Okay, there are specific chemicals that are being created through smoking specific chemicals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2515.5s	2515.5	 that are created through how your brain and your mind is reacting. And all of these things when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2520.3s	2520.3	 you're bathed in these chemicals for long periods of time, have known deleterious consequences,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2526.6s	2526.6	 some manifests in tumors, which then result in cancer, you die, lung cancer cigarettes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2531.4s	2531.4	 But what we're learning is some of these things result in long term imbalances of these critical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2537.0s	2537.0	 hormones and chemicals you need in your brain to stay healthy. And that results in anxiety or the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2542.7s	2542.7	 propensity to overeat or the propensity to then throw stuff up. And so I would be careful about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2549.0s	2549.0	 not assuming they're not physiologically the same, I actually think they're more similar than different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2553.9s	2553.9	 at a core physiological level. It's just that we're not used to the fact that something that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2559.6s	2559.6	 that is equivalent to looking at a screen could actually do that to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2562.7s	2562.7	 I guess the question is, what's the what's the what's the threshold for regulatory intervention?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2568.5s	2568.5	 If if someone did this at the scale, let's say there was a social network that was had 100,000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2574.0s	2574.0	 users, and people were actively using the social network every day and having body issues or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2579.2s	2579.2	 whatever the you know, the consequences claim might be, we're about to find out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2583.6s	2583.6	 You know, are we going to end up creating kind of a regulatory frame across all of these things?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2587.1s	2587.1	 And I think that this goes also to the point of scale, because at the end of the day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2592.1s	2592.1	 if you end up starting a business, and you're not successful, you don't really kind of find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2595.8s	2595.8	 yourself in the sort of framing of, well, what are you doing wrong? All of the companies that scale,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2601.0s	2601.0	 the assumption is they did something wrong in order to get to that scale, you know, roll off both
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2605.9s	2605.9	 the sexes former colleague and obviously famed investor at now at Sequoia Capital,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2614.0s	2614.0	 said that he always in the only invest in businesses that pursue one of the seven deadly sins,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2619.8s	2619.8	 because those are ultimately the things that consumers kind of increment their consumption
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2623.8s	2623.8	 of there has to be a seven deadly sin driver, you know, underscoring the success of any business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2631.1s	2631.1	 that sells to consumers. And if that is actually true, people aren't making kind of altruistic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2636.0s	2636.0	 purchasing and consumption decisions, they're making decisions based on envy and based on greed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2640.0s	2640.0	 and based on gluttony. And all of those drivers, we kind of, you know, are effectively to mark kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2645.7s	2645.7	 of related back to these physiological drivers, right. And so like, yeah, no, two things can be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2651.7s	2651.7	 right. What you said can be right. But I think what also can be right is, are we really willing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2657.1s	2657.1	 to bet that now there are not 50 individually ambitious, politically ambitious state agies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2663.5s	2663.5	 licking their chops, reading this stuff, wondering how many kids in their state may have suffered
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2667.7s	2667.7	 from an eating disorder or anxiety and blame it on one of these apps? Of course, are we convinced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2673.2s	2673.2	 that not a single lawsuit will get filed? Are we convinced that there's not going to be any class
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2677.1s	2677.1	 action? And by the way, that's just the United States. What is somebody that's sitting around a,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2682.7s	2682.7	 table of politicians desks in, you know, Germany, Belgium, France, Thailand, they're going to find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2690.3s	2690.3	 their issue in this treasure trove of content that's being, you know, continuously drip fed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2695.4s	2695.4	 out to the public. I guess my point is that this is today's issue. And business success, ultimately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2701.7s	2701.7	 over time in consumer markets will always ultimately be driven by products that have at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2707.2s	2707.2	 scale deleterious effects on the consumer market. And those deleterious effects will be a result of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2712.6s	2712.6	 some sort of kind of addictive or negative kind of consequence that arises when folks use these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2717.4s	2717.4	 things frequently. And the market figures out how to optimize the utilization of products to increase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2722.1s	2722.1	 revenue, to increase profit. And that's what a free market does. And I'm not saying it's right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2725.6s	2725.6	 or wrong. I'm just pointing out that there isn't, in my opinion, something unique here. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2730.3s	2730.3	 you know, Coca-Cola is the largest beverage company in the world. They sell 40 grams of sugar and 12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2734.6s	2734.6	 ounces of water. And everyone buys that and they feel great from that. And the sugar creates this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2738.4s	2738.4	 addictive problem. Now we've got an obesity epidemic, I'm not blaming Coca-Cola, but that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2741.9s	2741.9	 the general trend in CPG over the last 50 years, increasing sugar, increasing salt, and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2748.3s	2748.3	 difference is that this is not sugar, which is a generic compound. This is, for example, no different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2754.2s	2754.2	 than when Purdue Pharma started to make fentanyl. It's a really great drug. It has incredibly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2760.2s	2760.2	 superior advantages. It's used for a lot of very important things. When that spilled over, knowingly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2766.7s	2766.7	 to a level of abuse, and I don't think it was a lot of abuse, but there was enough that essentially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2771.8s	2771.8	 was overlooked in the building of a business. It started with state AGs who stepped in, and then it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2778.3s	2778.3	 basically ultimately drove a federal agreement, states agreements, a master settlement agreement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2783.9s	2783.9	 around fentanyl, and then Purdue essentially disgorging all the profits that they made.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2788.8s	2788.8	 So you're right, free markets should act in however way they're going to act. But when those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2795.9s	2795.9	 free market operators themselves are producing data that shows that, oh, shit, hold on, something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2800.1s	2800.1	 could be going wrong here. Then I do think that politicians will step in regulators could step in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2808.0s	2808.0	 I mean, what's crazy here is, you know, the FDA could actually act like if the FDA is willing to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2812.7s	2812.7	 act on Juul. What is the difference if the FDA says they feel like let's just assume that somebody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2817.7s	2817.7	 in the FDA says we feel like we should have a responsibility to think about mental health
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2822.6s	2822.6	 and eating disorders. But that's the slippery slope, right? What's the threshold, right? At
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2826.7s	2826.7	 what point do they say, no, we're not touching this? And at what point do they say, yes, we are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2829.9s	2829.9	 touching this? Because at the end of the day, any successful consumer product will have some degree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2833.9s	2833.9	 of deleterious effect. And this is why we have to have some perspective about it. So in preparation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2839.9s	2839.9	 for the segment, I asked my 11 year old girl, daughter, I know, Jake, how you don't think I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2846.7s	2846.7	 talk to my kids, but I made no joke. I was thinking of three or four fun things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2858.2s	2858.2	 Security. So the first thing she said is, who are you? And the second, and after I said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2864.6s	2864.6	 I'm your dad. And the second thing she said is, the second thing she said is I don't use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2869.2s	2869.2	 Instagram. I'm like, okay, well, what do you use? She said, tick tock. I'm like, well, the worst.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2873.5s	2873.5	 So I'm like, what do you use tick tock for? And she said, well, I watch dance videos. And I'm like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2878.7s	2878.7	 well, I've been reading press articles that say that the only thing on tick tock is sex and drugs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2885.3s	2885.3	 and that it's, you know, it's bringing you into a vortex of that. And she said, I don't watch that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2891.2s	2891.2	 I watch dance videos. And then smart as a whip, she said, the only people who end up watching that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2895.6s	2895.6	 are the ones who keep indicating, she didn't use the word preference, but she basically said that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2899.5s	2899.5	 they keep getting that stuff because they like it and they keep getting fed more of what they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2902.7s	2902.7	 watching. So look, I think we have to have a sense of perspective about this. At the end of the day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2908.5s	2908.5	 products like Facebook and Instagram are ways for people to share content and consume content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2915.0s	2915.0	 for people they follow. I mean, that's basically it. Now, is there a lot of bad shit on there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2919.1s	2919.1	 Yeah, because there's a lot of bad shit in the world. And should Facebook be trying to control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2923.8s	2923.8	 this stuff? Absolutely. But I don't, at the end of the day, think it's cigarettes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2930.6s	2930.6	 If they banned kids from using TikTok and Instagram until they were 16 years old, would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2935.6s	2935.6	 you be opposed to that? Because I don't let my kids use it. And I have an 11 year old. I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2939.6s	2939.6	 let her anywhere near. We have a complete moratorium. No social media is our rule. I can't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2944.4s	2944.4	 believe you let your kids use social media. I mean, I'm passing judgment, but I mean, like all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2948.4s	2948.4	 they use it for is to watch dance videos. So, but I think sex is point is an interesting one, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2953.5s	2953.5	 is, you know, based on what your daughter said, that that is effectively what's going on. It
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2957.5s	2957.5	 creates an acceleration of the natural evolution of these markets that historically may have taken,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2961.9s	2961.9	 call it 50 years for everyone to want to watch. MTV didn't emerge for 60 years until, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2968.7s	2968.7	 there was kind of radio and television broadcast signals. And then everyone said, you know what,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2973.1s	2973.1	 I want to watch rockers dancing on stage and going nuts and whatever the kind of consumer demand was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2977.9s	2977.9	 that eventually evolved there. What's happening in social media is within seconds, you make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2982.2s	2982.2	 evolutionary votes on kind of what you want in a media cycle. And then all of a sudden, a few hours
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2987.1s	2987.1	 later, you're getting exactly what you want over and over again, and you can't say no. And that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2991.8s	2991.8	 effectively what digital media generally, social media in particular has some nuances to it, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=2996.3s	2996.3	 digital media generally has enabled is an acceleration of the natural consumption trend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3001.4s	3001.4	 that we see with humans, which is they eventually want to go to one of the seven deadly sins. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3004.9s	3004.9	 that's what they kind of get stuck with. We've definitely talked about the danger of getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3008.0s	3008.0	 trapped in an information bubble and a feedback loop. And I do think that is a danger of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3014.4s	3014.4	 products. But so is cable news. I mean, you know, you look at Twitter, it's an outrage machine and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3019.9s	3019.9	 people get trapped in a cycle and they only want to they either follow people to get outraged by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3025.5s	3025.5	 them or just because they want to kind of self indoctrinate themselves. But that is basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3029.8s	3029.8	 why people watch cable news as well. I mean, it is an outrage machine, your friend Tucker,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3034.1s	3034.1	 or Rachel Maddow on MSNBC. They're both feeding different variations of outrage. And so my point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3042.1s	3042.1	 is, look, I don't think these problems are unique to social media. I think they pervade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3047.1s	3047.1	 Hollywood and the entertainment industry and even the news industry. Maybe look, maybe we should put

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3057.1s	3057.1	 of risk argument, we put warning labels on them. Maybe we need warning labels on these Instagram
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3061.9s	3061.9	 influencers. You put it you put it behind a counter and there's a strict prohibition on people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3066.7s	3066.7	 under the age of 18, being able to use them. And when it looks like, you know, companies like Jewel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3072.7s	3072.7	 were trying to circumvent those things or make it appear more valuable, basically to hook kids at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3079.1s	3079.1	 a younger and younger age when they weren't capable of making those decisions. They were held liable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3084.5s	3084.5	 So, okay, so there's a really interesting topic there, which is should people under the age of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3088.7s	3088.7	 say 16 or 18 be prohibited from using these products? Yes, 100% 100%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3097.6s	3097.6	 Look, if you if you think 16 or 18 16 or 18, let's 16 100% 18 16 100% and then there needs to be a way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3105.7s	3105.7	 of opting out because I think 16 years old are quite sophisticated. But here's the thing, we are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3110.7s	3110.7	 living longer and longer than ever. It is very likely that we're all going to generally live to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3114.8s	3114.8	 our hundreds. It's not the end of the world for these kids to have to wait an extra two or three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3119.3s	3119.3	 years until their literal physiology is a little bit better form so that they have better antibodies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3125.7s	3125.7	 to this shit. And I think that if we as a adult population aren't necessarily going to take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3132.0s	3132.0	 responsibility for these kids, I think we're doing them a huge disservice. You don't let your kids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3136.1s	3136.1	 run around wherever they want. You don't let them hold guns whenever they want. You don't let them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3140.2s	3140.2	 do a whole bunch of things that they may think is okay. But you know, could have really bad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3146.6s	3146.6	 consequences. And so if you know that this stuff is happening, I think it's very different to look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3152.3s	3152.3	 at a 22 year old and tell them what to do or not to do. That's not what we're debating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3156.6s	3156.6	 But what that data was about was about long term systemic health issues to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3164.5s	3164.5	 a large percentage of girls. That's really fucked up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3167.8s	3167.8	 Yeah. And a lot of the research that's come out, I dropped a couple links in the chat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3171.8s	3171.8	 You know, I haven't read the studies, but they're starting to show a correlation between suicide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3175.9s	3175.9	 rates and depression in young kids with social media. And it does skew towards females. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3181.3s	3181.3	 theory is females are more adept or more frequently in dynamic or complex social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3191.1s	3191.1	 situations. In other words, cyber bullying type situations where people use the social media to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3195.9s	3195.9	 just kind of bully each other. I mean, look, I think you guys have a real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3198.7s	3198.7	 point with respect to ages 13 to 16. Because I don't think you're allowed to use social media,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3203.1s	3203.1	 or at least the terms used prohibited under age 13.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3204.8s	3204.8	 We all know that's a joke. You and I have had to build products that have to abide by COPPA laws
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3211.2s	3211.2	 and we always just kind of laugh at it because they're bullshit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3213.6s	3213.6	 Right. Okay, fair enough. But what I'm saying is I think you guys have a real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3217.0s	3217.0	 issue that needs to be explored around what's the usage for ages 13 to 16. But look, what I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3223.5s	3223.5	 worry about with these things is you're always playing whack-a-mole, right? I mean, you basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3227.3s	3227.3	 ban social media and all of a sudden these kids, because they're very tech savvy, are going to find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3231.2s	3231.2	 themselves on text groups and text chats and they'll be in signal. And you won't even be able to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3235.9s	3235.9	 what they're doing. I mean, at least on social media, you can see it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3238.3s	3238.3	 The whole point of that though, that makes sense to me because I remember when I was growing up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3242.3s	3242.3	 and we all wanted to smoke, it was a pain in the ass to get cigarettes. So most of us just said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3247.1s	3247.1	 well, it's not worth it. But yeah, you're right. A handful of people found a way to get the cigarettes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3252.2s	3252.2	 to sneak behind the school to smoke them. That's fine. But that's very different than Jewel walking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3257.3s	3257.3	 into the middle of the lunchroom and passing out berry flavored vape pens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3260.9s	3260.9	 Yeah. Coconut.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3262.7s	3262.7	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3263.8s	3263.8	 That's what the FDA is saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3265.3s	3265.3	 Well, that's crazy. Obviously that shouldn't be allowed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3267.1s	3267.1	 They created packaging. If you look at the packaging, they created packaging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3268.8s	3268.8	 But why do you have the moral outrage around Jewel and berry flavored vaping and not this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3273.0s	3273.0	 Look, why do you care about Jewel? Or why should we generally care about Jewel and not care about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3278.3s	3278.3	 soda companies making 40 grams per 12 ounces of sugar, which is truly dangerous and damaging to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3284.5s	3284.5	 the health? Because we've been drinking soda for a long time and we've already accepted it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3287.7s	3287.7	 So we've allowed ourselves to accept it. We smoked cigarettes for a long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3290.8s	3290.8	 And then we had this kind of tobacco moratorium that's now kind of shut out smoking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3297.7s	3297.7	 If you said right now, COVID is a disease of the old and the obese, you would be canceled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3306.9s	3306.9	 Somebody tried to say that recently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3308.4s	3308.4	 That's not my point, Jake. My point is-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3309.6s	3309.6	 No, no. But the point is you're talking about like, people are very sensitive about this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3313.1s	3313.1	 obesity thing. And the second you say like, we need to monitor-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3317.3s	3317.3	 They call it diabetes. 40% of Americans with type 2 diabetes or whatever the status is-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3321.5s	3321.5	 There's also personal freedom. And do you want to drink a Coke Zero or water?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3325.1s	3325.1	 Exactly. And so if you have personal freedom, why should some regulator tell you what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3330.1s	3330.1	 social media tool you should or should not use? We're not debating that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3333.4s	3333.4	 The cover up is what we're talking about. If we're talking about minors, if we're talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3336.8s	3336.8	 about minors- What are you going to do with a 13 to 16 year old? What are you going to do with-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3341.5s	3341.5	 11 year old. That's the best part of your argument.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3343.6s	3343.6	 That's the best part of your argument is when we're dealing with minors, I could see the argument
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3347.3s	3347.3	 for more restrictions and potentially support them depending on what they are. I think that's-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3351.0s	3351.0	 What about minors not being able to drink soda? You have to be 16 year old to drink soda.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3357.2s	3357.2	 I mean, that's actually- That's where most diabetes and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3359.6s	3359.6	 obesity is rooted in this country. I actually am open minded to that position, actually. I know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3364.0s	3364.0	 it sounds crazy, but- No, I think that that makes an equal amount of sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3367.2s	3367.2	 Coca Cola makes no sense if we have a crazy obesity. If we can actually show that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3372.5s	3372.5	 So let's ask the question then. So let me ask the second order question about this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3377.2s	3377.2	 which is, Friberg is right that drinking sodas for 13 year olds has got to be as harmful or more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3383.5s	3383.5	 than using Facebook. So why do we never hear about that? I would argue that there's something else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3388.4s	3388.4	 going on here with this massive amount of attacks on social networking companies. There's a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3395.0s	3395.0	 people who hate social networking in the traditional legacy media because they've been disrupted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3401.0s	3401.0	 by Facebook, by these social media companies. And so they're looking-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3403.5s	3403.5	 They took their money. They took their money and they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3405.5s	3405.5	 looking to publicize any article about the negative effects of these companies, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3410.3s	3410.3	 they're not threatened by Coca Cola. So they're not going to publish those kinds of studies. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3414.5s	3414.5	 I just think that there's an argument that perhaps- I'm not saying you're wrong. I think there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3419.7s	3419.7	 absolutely truth in what you're saying. It's all a matter of degree though and perspective. And I do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3424.8s	3424.8	 think that the traditional media has an incentive to blow this out of proportion a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3429.8s	3429.8	 Because they have an agenda is where you're saying it's a-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3431.4s	3431.4	 Yeah, absolutely. And I think people in power- Look, I think there's a positive thing about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3436.9s	3436.9	 social networking. I mean, because we haven't said one positive thing about it. Social networking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3441.3s	3441.3	 overall enables us to stay in touch with people we care about, friends, family, and allows us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3446.8s	3446.8	 to receive information from people we want to follow. We never talk about those positives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3451.5s	3451.5	 I find it an incredibly convenient way to consume news. So we never talk about that. But here's why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3459.6s	3459.6	 is because social media is fundamentally a democratizing force. It enables people to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3465.5s	3465.5	 coordinate in a much more democratized way than they ever had been able to before. I do think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3470.6s	3470.6	 is threatening to people in power. And given the chance they would like to suppress it. Zuckerberg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3475.6s	3475.6	 gave a speech a few years ago about social networks being the, I think, called the fourth estate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3480.0s	3480.0	 with the third estate being the press. And in the same way that there are people who want to empower,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3485.2s	3485.2	 who want to censor the press, I do believe that there are people in power who want to censor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3488.7s	3488.7	 social networks, because they don't like the disruptive democratizing force that it represents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3493.9s	3493.9	 And there is a lot of positive to that in the world. You're I think you're mixing up a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3499.0s	3499.0	 things there. So yeah, you're right. And I don't think any of us are saying cancel these companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3504.3s	3504.3	 and remove them from the internet. I think what we're saying is there are very specific ways in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3509.0s	3509.0	 which certain features are built, that they are expressed in features that are now apparently,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3515.5s	3515.5	 according to their own work and exploration, are linked to mental health issues. So I think the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3522.8s	3522.8	 point is, people should now decide whether to your point, we should ignore it, because the good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3529.3s	3529.3	 vastly outweighs, you know, what's a third of girls who the fuck cares, right? I mean, they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3533.6s	3533.6	 chicks, so whatever. Or you say, actually, this is a really big problem. And so let's step up and fix
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3540.0s	3540.0	 it, because somebody needs to protect these people. And when you're 16 or 17 or 18, do whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3545.5s	3545.5	 you want, like we let people do today, you want to drink a Coca Cola every day, get diabetes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3550.7s	3550.7	 you can do that nobody tries to stop you, right? You want to smoke a pack of smokes a day, you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3555.3s	3555.3	 do that nobody stops you. But we do a lot of other things to try to help kids. I think I think we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3562.1s	3562.1	 only talking about ages, if we're talking about the minors, the kids, I think you and I can find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3566.5s	3566.5	 agreement on this issue, I think, but but I do think that the demonization of social media goes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3571.1s	3571.1	 well beyond that. But look, I think you've got a great point with respect to the kids.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3574.9s	3574.9	 Do you guys believe this is a theory that's been growing that tick tock run by the Chinese government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3580.5s	3580.5	 is trying to reprogram ethics, morals and doing psych psych ops basically, there's some ops on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3586.7s	3586.7	 our children. No, Jay, there's something bigger than that. I mean, I think all of you guys probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3590.7s	3590.7	 upgraded to 14.8 iOS this week, I hope you haven't and everybody listening, if you haven't, please go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3596.3s	3596.3	 upgrade it. But you know, the Israeli spy firm, NSO had apparently created a zero click exploit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3603.1s	3603.1	 for the iPhone, where you could turn on the camera and the microphone and basically spy on folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3609.4s	3609.4	 completely unaware. And you know, Jason, and I were talking about this. And I think Jason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3615.3s	3615.3	 you were the one that said you're like, Yeah, we've been living with that with tick tock for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3618.4s	3618.4	 years. It's not as if, you know, NSO just licensed it randomly to the Saudi government. I mean, this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3623.1s	3623.1	 tool has been available for a while. So to your point, but do we think that the Chinese government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3628.7s	3628.7	 tick tock are trying to program our children to be more deviant and to create social unrest? And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3634.9s	3634.9	 No, you don't think that they're trying to steer them with the algorithm towards bad results,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3638.9s	3638.9	 because they're not letting their kids play video games. No, I think if you look at that Wall Street,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3642.9s	3642.9	 did you see the Wall Street Journal article that I just sent to you guys? Wall Street Journal article
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3646.9s	3646.9	 basically created a bunch of kids accounts, and then did searches or what started to go down a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3652.4s	3652.4	 rabbit hole. And just with one keyword search, you know, these kids went into deep, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3658.0s	3658.0	 kink BDSM sort of result. This is a this is a pretty straightforward weighted tree algorithm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3662.7s	3662.7	 Okay, so like, when you start on a branch of a tree, and you keep clicking on those things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3667.1s	3667.1	 that's what you will get. This is no different than how Facebook's algorithm works, how Google's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3671.5s	3671.5	 search algorithm works for you. Once you start behaving with clicks, or swipes or likes, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3677.9s	3677.9	 use that as a feedback loop, and they wait basically weigh the next set of results. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3681.9s	3681.9	 David's daughter is right, if you click on sex, drugs and rock and roll, that's, it's not all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3686.3s	3686.3	 you're going to get, but it's going to be a large percentage of what you get, because the algorithm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3689.9s	3689.9	 in a blunt way, assumes that that's what you like. Yeah. So I'm not sure that this is repeating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3695.2s	3695.2	 anything that so you know, it's pretty obvious that that's how it should work if they want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3700.8s	3700.8	 have maximum utilization. Well, you know, the thing that's slightly different about TikTok is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3705.5s	3705.5	 you know, in Facebook or Instagram, you build your feed and Twitter, and then it serves it up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3710.3s	3710.3	 algorithmically on TikTok, it uses the entire corpus. So if you do one search for a keyword,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3716.6s	3716.6	 now it's not just a subset of what your friends posted in some ranked order, it's the entire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3721.2s	3721.2	 corpus of like long tail. And so what they show in this TikTok is like how quickly a child who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3727.1s	3727.1	 just types in one keyword can be have their feed be 90% drug use. And, you know, sadomasochistic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3733.4s	3733.4	 whatever you're into, sex, I don't know. If the content is obscene, then it should be taken down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3744.5s	3744.5	 to begin with. Okay. And, look, my takeaway from this conversation is that we need to do something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3751.6s	3751.6	 different for kids. I don't know if it's a flat out prohibition or what, but yeah, but look, so the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3758.3s	3758.3	 TikTok algorithm thing, if you want to keep seeing more and more content related to something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3763.5s	3763.5	 fine, the algorithm is going to give you more and more of what you want as a consumer. But maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3767.1s	3767.1	 for kids, there needs to be some guardrails around that. And we don't direct kids towards certain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3772.7s	3772.7	 kinds of content around, you know, sex or drugs or violence. I have to constantly remind parents,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3778.3s	3778.3	 like YouTube, kids should not use YouTube, because it goes really to crazy dark places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3783.3s	3783.3	 And there's kids YouTube, and kids YouTube, they add each and every video. Now you still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3788.1s	3788.1	 get some of that consumption and unboxing of things, your kids will ask you to buy a bunch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3792.5s	3792.5	 of stuff, but you're not going to get straight up sex violence and, you know, every month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3796.3s	3796.3	 I'll tell you what does happen. My I put kids YouTube on my kids, my four year old's iPad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3802.4s	3802.4	 And then the other day, she said she saw some like scary horror thing on there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3806.3s	3806.3	 and she couldn't sleep and she woke up in the middle of the night, because, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3808.6s	3808.6	 if we're not doing our job as parents curating the content and curating what our kids are doing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3812.6s	3812.6	 and we're leaving it to this app, we're totally f'd. And that's what I realized I did my laziness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3819.3s	3819.3	 in like just thinking like, oh, there was something she wanted to watch, I put the app on there and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3822.8s	3822.8	 didn't pay attention for a few weeks. And all of a sudden, she had gone down the rabbit hole,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3825.8s	3825.8	 found something scary. It's a I don't know if you guys use this, but I use an app called Custodio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3831.9s	3831.9	 It's with a Q, Q, U, S, T, U, D, I, O. And you can kind of like lock down all these devices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3837.9s	3837.9	 And then at the end of every week, it gives you an email of all the app usage and all the links
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3843.0s	3843.0	 that these that my kids clicked on, or just my oldest one, he's the only one that has a phone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3849.4s	3849.4	 But that's nice. And you had a discussion with them about that? Like, hey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3852.5s	3852.5	 you're privileged to have this and tell me what you do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3856.1s	3856.1	 I agree. It's still super, super hard. But this is why I think you need to have some blunt force
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3860.9s	3860.9	 instruments right now. And my blunt force instruments are you're not allowed to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3864.2s	3864.2	 Well, the ones that we've they're not allowed to have tic toc, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3869.8s	3869.8	 Twitter. Yes, hard now. And the only reason we allow YouTube is because a lot of the school links
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3877.6s	3877.6	 are the videos inside of YouTube. And so you can't lock it down. But that's why I use this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3881.1s	3881.1	 Custodio app to see what they're watching on YouTube. Even then, though, it's not perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3885.0s	3885.0	 By the way, this thing that just came from the Pentagon is a total Friday news drop. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3889.3s	3889.3	 talk about a Friday news drop. I don't know what we don't know what you're talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3893.5s	3893.5	 US military iconologists, Kabul drone strike killed 10 civilians, including seven children.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3899.1s	3899.1	 We knew this they're just confirming something that had been exposed. New York Times did excellent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3904.2s	3904.2	 reporting on excellent reporting by the New York Times. That was incredible journalism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3908.4s	3908.4	 I mean, did you guys see that they were like watching frame for frame of like a video,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3912.9s	3912.9	 then they were like going to Google Maps, they were comparing colors of cars, they were looking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3916.8s	3916.8	 at sides of buildings. Incredible reporting by the New York Times. It was really the I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3922.4s	3922.4	 it's obviously a tragedy was the final debacle of our Afghanistan involvement. This was a foreign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3928.7s	3928.7	 aid worker who actually he was there as an aid worker. And they stay had him on video loading

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3942.3s	3942.3	 like that. And he was doing his errands. And then he comes home. And they hit the the car with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3949.1s	3949.1	 you know, a massive missile from one of these Reaper drones. And it kills him as well as,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3955.2s	3955.2	 you know, it's basically 10 members of his extended family, including seven children. Now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3960.9s	3960.9	 the I mean, I think I understand why this well, we don't exactly know why this happened. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3967.1s	3967.1	 think it needs to be investigated. Obviously, the military in Kabul was on high alert, because we

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3978.2s	3978.2	 I think we had three 13 soldiers killed a few days before this. But but it just shows the kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3984.8s	3984.8	 of mistakes that we can make even fighting drone warfare. You know, the idea was the term casualties
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3990.2s	3990.2	 of war exists for a reason. Like, this is how war works. You cannot do it perfectly. It's messy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=3996.1s	3996.1	 Everybody innocent people dies is why war is the worst thing. But how did we ever should be the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4000.2s	4000.2	 last resort? Right. And how did we ever think we're going to win hearts and minds in this country by,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4005.1s	4005.1	 you know, like we made too many mistakes. Like they're not interested in democracy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4009.9s	4009.9	 like in the way we want them to be and the West wants them to be. By the way, forcing it down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4015.1s	4015.1	 their throats is not going to work. We could have maintained a base there. There were better ways to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4019.4s	4019.4	 exit. But let's fix the schools in California first. Yeah, I think that's I think that ultimately,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4025.6s	4025.6	 I think people are going to forget those images of people on planes and just think, thank God,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4030.1s	4030.1	 that's over. I think now that there hasn't been 20, you know, and hopefully there's not another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4035.1s	4035.1	 911. Alright, let's wrap with Ellen Powell wrote a piece for the New York Times op ed section,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4042.4s	4042.4	 section on sexism in tech, using the Elizabeth Holmes trial as the main example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4050.8s	4050.8	 She was also on tech checks, the NBC show and discussed her op ed quote,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4055.8s	4055.8	 Home should be held accountable for her actions as chief executive of Theranos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4060.5s	4060.5	 And it can be sexist to hold her accountable for alleged serious wrongdoing and not hold an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4068.5s	4068.5	 array of men accountable for reports of wrongdoing and bad judgment. She uses Travis Kalanick and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4074.4s	4074.4	 Adam Newman as examples of men who have engaged in questionable unethical even dangerous behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4079.4s	4079.4	 in tech without much legal penalty. And that they both went on to start new companies. Her main
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4086.3s	4086.3	 example, however, of bias is tech executive Kevin Burns, who is the former CEO of Jool, J-U-U-L,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4094.6s	4094.6	 who helped the e-cigarette vaping company raise $12 billion. But he left Jool amidst a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4101.8s	4101.8	 legal blowback. And just this past week, with a bunch of cash, with about Yeah, I mean, of course,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4107.4s	4107.4	 you get the secure the bag on the way out Adam Newman to and don't drop the bag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4114.7s	4114.7	 You have one job to do don't drop the bag. Yes, run. But don't do not drop the bag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4121.5s	4121.5	 So she meant she mentioned other stories like Juicero. If you guys remember this company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4127.5s	4127.5	 A couple years ago, they raised $100 million pre launch right? It was a juicer that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4131.9s	4131.9	 you know, was supposed to juice my juice from my juicer. Oh, yeah, the claim that they made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4137.1s	4137.1	 was that inside of the packets was like fresh vegetables. And this thing squeezed the fresh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4141.3s	4141.3	 vegetables and fresh juice juice came out. And it turns out that the bag was just filled with juice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4146.5s	4146.5	 And so no, I think the bag was filled with shaved vegetables or whatever. But you can squeeze the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4151.2s	4151.2	 bag. Squeeze the bag. So that it was already pre juiced is what, you know, Olivia's asking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4157.1s	4157.1	 who's now Olivia Peterson. It was she basically put she kind of made a whole video and put it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4163.7s	4163.7	 on Bloomberg. They had juice in these packets and they were telling people what they thought.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4169.6s	4169.6	 So they could have opened the jar. Sorry, sorry, sorry. They could have put it into a machine and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4173.2s	4173.2	 paid $7. The juice then took that juice, put it in a bag. Yeah, that was supposed to be fresh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4178.7s	4178.7	 vegetables sold that as fresh vegetables to then get juiced. To get charged $8 a bag for this stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4186.8s	4186.8	 Who invested in that? Who invested in that? Who wrote the hundred million dollars?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4190.3s	4190.3	 Google Ventures. Anyway, a lot of people invested in this thing. It was a huge,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4193.9s	4193.9	 it was a huge like, you know, better for the planet story. But it turns out that the hardware
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4198.3s	4198.3	 didn't work. And then they ended up kind of faking it till you make it. It was very similar to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4201.7s	4201.7	 Theranos in the sense that there was a piece of hardware that made a claim that wasn't necessarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4205.5s	4205.5	 true. And granted, no lives were at risk in this particular case. But some might argue lives were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4210.8s	4210.8	 at risk in the case of Juul. But I think, you know, you see this a lot more in these kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4215.7s	4215.7	 hardware, particularly in life sciences companies. You know, there's a business like, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4220.3s	4220.3	 Zymogen is a good example, right? It's very hard tech, very deep tech. Josh Hoffman did an incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4225.8s	4225.8	 job fundraising, raised a $400 million round from SoftBank, took the company public. Then they go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4230.3s	4230.3	 public and a few weeks later, they're like, oh, wait, sorry, we don't actually have any product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4234.3s	4234.3	 or any revenue. And we talked about this a few months ago, a few weeks ago, and the stock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4238.5s	4238.5	 completely collapsed. There's another company called Berkeley Lights, which went public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4243.1s	4243.1	 And yesterday, Scorpion Capital, one of these short sellers put out 160 page report on these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4247.9s	4247.9	 guys, showing that Berkeley Lights' product actually, it's a hardware, life sciences hardware
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4252.6s	4252.6	 that costs $2 million. They've sold it into all the pharma companies. And Scorpion saying, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4257.1s	4257.1	 this thing doesn't work. It's a total fraud. Like there's no, the machine doesn't do what they claim
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4261.6s	4261.6	 it does. Okay, but so to Alan Pau's point, is there a double standard or not? Right. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4268.2s	4268.2	 these were all run by male CEOs and nothing happened to them. And, and they are white as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4275.0s	4275.0	 Um, yeah, yeah, they're all white. All right. First of all, let's take it easy on the white
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4279.9s	4279.9	 guys to mouth. It's three other guys. I'm asking a qualifying question. It is. So here's what I'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4288.7s	4288.7	 ask is, I mean, is this a surprise that white dudes will get a hall pass? I don't think that's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4292.6s	4292.6	 shocker. Yeah, it's considered it's considered entrepreneurial failure. But when it comes to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4296.6s	4296.6	 woman that everyone I think was excited about seeing succeed because she was a woman, it becomes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4301.8s	4301.8	 fraud. And I think, you know, there's two different things. Yeah, go ahead. Is it free,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4306.3s	4306.3	 but isn't there two different things between, you know, where she obviously misled people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4312.1s	4312.1	 in a premeditated way and lied to them, like taking their blood sample, and then putting it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4317.9s	4317.9	 in a fake machine, then doing it in the back on an Abbott machine, and then bringing the real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4321.2s	4321.2	 results back and making it on her Theranos Edison machine. I mean, this is literal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4326.3s	4326.3	 wire for a securities fraud. In these other cases, is it people who are ambitious, if you look at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4331.1s	4331.1	 Juicerow, it's kind of like this is a stupid idea that got overfunded. He put he put juice in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4336.1s	4336.1	 packet and told you no, he put shaved, he put chef shaved vegetables in the packet, and then used
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4341.2s	4341.2	 hydraulics, which is an actual real thing. That's actually not correct. Watch the video that Olivia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4346.2s	4346.2	 put on Bloomberg a few years ago, which I just saw pictures of it. I mean, maybe there's a different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4350.5s	4350.5	 what they showed is that it was already squeezed. Yes, there was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4353.1s	4353.1	 she was already squeezed. I mean, it was like, it was like a crazy story when this came out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4360.8s	4360.8	 Everyone's like, Oh, my God, like it was a standard, like hardware is really difficult.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4364.7s	4364.7	 You know, novel hardware technology is really difficult. So you fake it till you make it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4368.3s	4368.3	 And in some cases, you launch a product that doesn't even work. You know, and there's just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4372.7s	4372.7	 and this isn't just in hardware. It's also in life sciences. You see this a lot where you ship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4376.7s	4376.7	 a product, I would probably say that if if regulators believe that those CEOs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4384.1s	4384.1	 tried to commit fraud, they would have done challenges, right? Maybe they still will,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4389.6s	4389.6	 they should follow up with those folks. So why do you think they went after Elizabeth Holmes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4393.1s	4393.1	 Chimath? Because it was actually there was a legal case. I think there's I think there's one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4397.1s	4397.1	 really important there are two things at play in Theranos, which is different. Number one is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4403.5s	4403.5	 kinds of investors that were involved here are extremely powerful folks, not necessarily, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4412.2s	4412.2	 know, technology capable, but very, very well known, highly connected people in the establishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4420.6s	4420.6	 And the second was that they were operating in a regulated market, which has very strict laws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4426.7s	4426.7	 Look, I've tried to build competing products to Theranos for years, I've been pretty public about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4431.5s	4431.5	 this. I've tried five or six times, they failed every single time, I couldn't even get out of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4436.0s	4436.0	 starting line. You know, these tests would never work without with a single drop of blood, it just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4441.1s	4441.1	 didn't make any sense. The only version of this problem that has been solved well, is the ability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4445.8s	4445.8	 to detect cell free cancer DNA in blood, right using a very small quantum of blood. Companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4452.7s	4452.7	 like garden and grail have actually done and built a great business out of it. But it requires
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4457.9s	4457.9	 extremely sophisticated machinery sold to them by Illumina and others. So if you're operating in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4463.5s	4463.5	 regulated market, the bar is higher, there is a lot more scrutiny. And then on top of that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4471.5s	4471.5	 I think she compounded it by including folks and raising capital from folks that may not have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4476.5s	4476.5	 actually known and been able to diligence. And so that's the cycle of fraud that may or may not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4481.0s	4481.0	 have occurred there. And she has to, or they have, there's a burden to prove that. It's very different,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4487.2s	4487.2	 I think over here in an unregulated market where you can just kind of build whatever you want. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4491.9s	4491.9	 if smart investors look, Nick just put in the group chat. So the investors in Juicero were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4498.3s	4498.3	 Google Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Thrive Capital. I mean, these are all very sophisticated folks that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4503.9s	4503.9	 you know, made a decision and you know, it's probably not the case that they were lied to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4509.1s	4509.1	 I understand why they made the Juicero mistake. Because at the time, fresh pressed juice using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4514.7s	4514.7	 hydraulics was a thing. And this guy said, that's what I'm going to do. I'm gonna use hydraulics,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4518.3s	4518.3	 I'm going to squeeze the vegetables so you get the best stuff. I understand why they fell for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4522.6s	4522.6	 Because my wife was buying that press. My wife, Jay was buying that press juicery juice in LA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4528.6s	4528.6	 You remember this trend? It's pure sugar. That stuff is pure sugar. It's vegetable juice too,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4532.6s	4532.6	 but it would cost like $11 because they would use so much vegetables. And I saw these presses they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4536.7s	4536.7	 used. It's incredibly inefficient, but the juice tastes really great. But the thing I have a problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4542.0s	4542.0	 with Ellen Pao story is she brings up, you know, the harassment stuff and, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4549.3s	4549.3	 this is an issue of gender, etc. But on this week in startups, I've been covering fraud after fraud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4554.7s	4554.7	 I don't know if you saw app Annie got an SEC fine yesterday. What happened, Jason, because I saw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4560.4s	4560.4	 that Annie they told people who were using their analytics products building apps, there's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4564.9s	4564.9	 8 million people that they would never sell their data except in aggregate. And then they went to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4568.4s	4568.4	 Wall Street people and said, here's actually we'll sell you the data. And you can trade on it. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4574.3s	4574.3	 so yeah, yeah. So I don't think that's like insider trading exactly. But it might be but anyway,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4580.3s	4580.3	 the guy is like, that's the whole point of that. That's the whole point of reg FD. The whole point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4584.7s	4584.7	 is if somebody knows something, if you're a financial actor, Jason, and you know something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4589.1s	4589.1	 so like, if all of us were sitting around a table, you know, and somebody said something about a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4594.7s	4594.7	 random public company. If that's not public information, if that's not known, two things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4600.7s	4600.7	 have to happen. Number one is I when I receive it, must not do anything with it. And that second
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4607.2s	4607.2	 that person who disclosed it needs to then file an 8k and say, oops, I accidentally said this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4612.7s	4612.7	 Right. So there's now what where does this is an end around around things like reg FD. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4617.1s	4617.1	 that's a really big deal. Well, and then I guess the question is, like, what happens with people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4620.4s	4620.4	 who use Planet Labs or whatever to, you know, to satellite images of the target parking lot or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4625.3s	4625.3	 put people as spotters outside of Starbucks and count the people coming in and out? Is that public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4629.3s	4629.3	 information? That's public. But if you have a service that says one thing, yes, and you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4634.3s	4634.3	 violating that, but then you may also be violating reg FD. So they haven't gone after people for on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4639.3s	4639.3	 the other side of the trade for securities fraud, but they charged him with securities fraud, he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4642.7s	4642.7	 pays 10 million bucks, I think he's in the penalty box can't be, you know, run up, be a public officer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4647.8s	4647.8	 for three years. Then we had headspin. I don't know if you saw that SaaS company. But headspin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4654.5s	4654.5	 was involved in just basically straight up lying about their SaaS offer. Then you have tether the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4658.7s	4658.7	 stable coin, they've been banned from New York by the DOJ, they've been banned by the Canadian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4663.5s	4663.5	 regulators for the first two crypto exchanges there. And supposedly, the DOJ is investigating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4667.4s	4667.4	 them. And then there's about five ICOs in New York that have been prosecuted already. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4671.9s	4671.9	 I know Ellen saying like, they're not prosecuting men, but I'm seeing them all the time. Yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4676.5s	4676.5	 they're just not right. The press is not obsessed with them. Because let's face it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4680.7s	4680.7	 Elizabeth Holmes was Elizabeth Holmes. She was weird. I mean, the voice, there's a lot of peculiar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4686.3s	4686.3	 things about her that you don't see in other folks who are boring, right? By the way, what you just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4691.0s	4691.0	 said is part of the sexist claim that Ellen made, which is that we talked about her dress and how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4696.5s	4696.5	 she dressed and how she talked. We don't talk about that kind of stuff when it comes to other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4700.2s	4700.2	 entrepreneurs. And of course, they did that. And Newman, they were talking about him being a hippie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4704.7s	4704.7	 walking around with bare feet being six, seven, every profile. She's wrong in that case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4709.5s	4709.5	 Every profile of Andy Newman talked about his personal life and his wife is married to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4714.7s	4714.7	 what's her names. No, Gwyneth Paltrow's cousin. So Ellen's 100% wrong on that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4719.9s	4719.9	 Yeah. And didn't Elizabeth Holmes make it relevant by dressing deliberately styling herself in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4725.4s	4725.4	 fashion of Steve Jobs with the black turtleneck and the glasses? I mean, you know, she portrayed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4731.2s	4731.2	 herself as the next Steve Jobs. I mean, it was part of the grift. So yeah, exactly. Now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4736.8s	4736.8	 did gender play into it? Yeah. But I think not necessarily in the way that Ellen Powell thinks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4740.4s	4740.4	 in this sense that the media wanted to believe so badly that the next Steve Jobs was going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4747.1s	4747.1	 a woman that they kind of look past what should have been staring them in the face. I mean, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4752.7s	4752.7	 if a man had gotten out there wearing the black turtleneck and the John Lennon glasses or whatever,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4757.9s	4757.9	 they would have said, who is this clown? Yeah, exactly. But they suspended.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4763.9s	4763.9	 They suspended. You have to dress up as Steve Jobs in the next episode,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4767.0s	4767.0	 Freebird. You can make it work. Can we all do it? Can we see Elizabeth? Oh, let's do a Halloween
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4770.5s	4770.5	 episode where we all show up. I'll do Elizabeth Holmes for Halloween episode. But no, but that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4774.9s	4774.9	 like a nested Steve Jobs. So like you're going to be Elizabeth Holmes past Steve Jobs. Yeah, we should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4777.8s	4777.8	 all do our own versions of, yes. Very meta. Elizabeth and Steve Jobs. I think, Sacks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4781.9s	4781.9	 you're entirely right. I think you're right. I think this is the way that gender has played
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4785.5s	4785.5	 into it is that there's a lot of people who really wanted the Elizabeth Holmes story to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4790.0s	4790.0	 true. And frankly, she used that in order to perpetuate her fraud. She may not have used it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4795.7s	4795.7	 but she was definitely influenced. Or she benefited from it. She definitely used it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4799.5s	4799.5	 I want to ask you guys kind of a controversial question. You know, because this story made me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4805.9s	4805.9	 think a lot about some of what's gone on in businesses that I know of, and where I know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4812.0s	4812.0	 that there is to some degree fraud and misrepresentation happening by the CEO and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4815.9s	4815.9	 founder. And this is a little known secret in Silicon Valley, or a little spoken of secret,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4822.2s	4822.2	 which is that more often than not, if you know about fraud at a company in Silicon Valley,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4826.8s	4826.8	 you're encouraged to keep your mouth shut. Because the idea is at the end of the day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4830.3s	4830.3	 if they're gaining lots of capital, more capital floats all boats and more money will rush into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4835.5s	4835.5	 that market. And so if there's businesses that you're competing with that are committing fraud,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4838.7s	4838.7	 rather than raise your hand, which then people say, Hey, look, if you're going to raise your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4842.1s	4842.1	 hand and claim fraud and talk negatively about another company, people are going to start doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4846.1s	4846.1	 that about you. And they're going to start doing that about your portfolio. And so you guys know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4850.7s	4850.7	 this, right? Like you're discouraged from calling out these sorts of moments when you see them in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4855.0s	4855.0	 Silicon Valley, because there is the perceived kind of look, we're all in a club together,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4859.1s	4859.1	 we're all in it together, we got to be careful not to talk smack, because then capital will stop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4862.7s	4862.7	 coming in, people will come after you. And we're much more of kind of a supportive open community.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4867.6s	4867.6	 But there is experience that I have with at least two companies in the last year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4872.3s	4872.3	 and you know, I've kept my mouth shut. Because, and by the way, I don't think that there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4875.6s	4875.6	 necessarily harm going on. But I know of misrepresentation. But the investors are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4879.3s	4879.3	 like, Look, we'd love to see these guys succeed, because that would be good for you in this way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4882.6s	4882.6	 because then you would be more money flowing in and yada yada. And there's always a narrative around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4886.1s	4886.1	 why you don't want to do this, you know, why you don't want to call these things out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4889.4s	4889.4	 I called it out. And I've still got a crazy founder denouncing me years later. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4894.1s	4894.1	 look, I hate who has an SEC enforcement against him. Yeah, exactly. A sanction. So yeah, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4901.0s	4901.0	 look, I you're right, freeburg, that there's very little upshot to doing it. But but look, I hate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4908.3s	4908.3	 but we have to distinguish between fraud and sort of puffing. Okay, here's the thing that I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4915.1s	4915.1	 you know, Ellen Powell is kind of missing is when she criticizes all these founders who are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4919.5s	4919.5	 visionary and evangelical and, and promoting something that ends up not working, that is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4925.5s	4925.5	 fraud. I mean, every startup, we asked the founder, how are you going to change the world?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4935.9s	4935.9	 set of things unrealistic in the sense that it comes true, maybe one out of 1000 times, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4939.9s	4939.9	 Every startup, their founding mission is a bit of an over promise. And just because it doesn't come

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4951.0s	4951.0	 world would interpret that as fraud, because the founder told them something that ends up not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4955.4s	4955.4	 happening not ends up being true. And this is why you really it's very dangerous to take money

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=4964.2s	4964.2	 just because it doesn't work out and what you said ended up not being true does not make it fraud.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5010.8s	5010.8	 times what we would be honest with was she lied about the results. And she lied about the results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5016.7s	5016.7	 She lied about real people's blood test results, like actual civilians. Well, I have some empathy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5028.7s	5028.7	 Steve Holmes, hold on when I was told, I think I told this story I was asking an investor,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5034.1s	5034.1	 hey, what's the hottest company around? This is in, you know, 2013 or 14. He said Theranos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5041.4s	5041.4	 And there was no way to get connected to the company. So then I was like, you know, I had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5046.3s	5046.3	 heard just the bullet point one drop of blood, full characterization of your, you know, be able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5052.7s	5052.7	 to do a blood test, etc. I thought this is an incredible idea. But because I had no way of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5057.6s	5057.6	 getting connected. Now, thank God that turned out to be a good thing. I was like, well, fuck it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5060.8s	5060.8	 I'll just start my own version. I'll figure out how to do this. And, and Jason, as you said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5064.9s	5064.9	 it turned out to be much, much harder than I thought. And five different iterations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5068.7s	5068.7	 five different teams and you know, PhDs from MIT, Stanford, everything we couldn't Caltech,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5074.3s	5074.3	 we couldn't figure it out. So it's not wrong to want to believe that something is possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5080.7s	5080.7	 And it's not illegal to do that. But as David said, the minute that you try to you tell lies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5085.5s	5085.5	 about the past in order to basically then change the future in a way that should happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5090.2s	5090.2	 That's really that's really unfair. Yeah, it's what do you think of the defense that

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5103.1s	5103.1	 other reporters were basically not buying it. And we talked about this last time, didn't we?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5110.8s	5110.8	 Yeah, yeah, I'm just curious if you're have been following the trial,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5114.4s	5114.4	 I think it's hard for somebody who in the moment took credit for every decision for every piece of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5120.4s	5120.4	 press for claim to be the jobsy and micromanager to all of a sudden now turn around and say, no,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5125.6s	5125.6	 that wasn't me making the decisions. I was under the spell of somebody else. I think that's a tough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5130.5s	5130.5	 argument to make. Also, I think, you know, this is going to come out, but she actually fired
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5137.7s	5137.7	 Balwani. So if she fired him, how was she? Yeah, it's a harder to do the Schmengali defense, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5144.4s	5144.4	 well, maybe they're both guilty. Maybe it could be an and or Gali Sven. All right, listen, we'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5153.0s	5153.0	 close on this. MailChimp has sold to Intuit for $12 billion in the largest bootstrapped acquisition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5159.7s	5159.7	 ever. We all know MailChimp. And we all know QuickBooks. It's a huge deal. I have one issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5166.5s	5166.5	 with this. And I don't know if it's true or not. But apparently, none of the employees have any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5170.9s	5170.9	 equity. Yes, and that was what it's about to get to employees didn't have equity. However,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5176.0s	5176.0	 and I've known MailChimp for a while, for over a decade, been using the product and know the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5179.7s	5179.7	 founder had him on the podcast before. Have they been a sponsor of your pod? They sponsored in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5184.7s	5184.7	 first year, I think or two. And were you an angel investor? I was not I tried to be and he said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5190.3s	5190.3	 we're never going to ever raise money. And he was never ever going to sell. And he was also never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5196.4s	5196.4	 going to sell. I they gave 12 billion reasons to change his mind. Exactly. They gave him the 20%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5204.7s	5204.7	 My understanding was employees got a 20% cash bonus and they were amongst the highest paid,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5210.7s	5210.7	 you know, in the industry. So their plan was instead of giving people some big reward at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5215.9s	5215.9	 end, they were just distributing cash, basically, they were just distributing cash. So if you had a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5219.2s	5219.2	 hundred, if you were 150k developer, you got 30k on top. That's not an unreasonable way to run a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5224.1s	5224.1	 business that has no outside investors that, you know, and employees know that going in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5228.7s	5228.7	 they didn't go in with the expectation of equity, they went in with the expectation of a high salary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5232.4s	5232.4	 and a big bonus and they got it. I do that in a few companies, few companies that I own, I do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5237.4s	5237.4	 But what I also do is I let them buy into the company every year. I just think that it's a good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5243.1s	5243.1	 principle to have like an ownership in the business. I think you should be paying a lot of money and we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5247.4s	5247.4	 should pay cash bonuses for, for achieving results. We do that. But then what we also say is if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5252.3s	5252.3	 want to buy equity, come in and buy it. But you're probably right from a performance perspective,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5256.1s	5256.1	 Chamath. I don't think it's necessarily a moral obligation to do that. Right? How this guy wants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5260.0s	5260.0	 to run his business up to him, you know, people may be choice voted. Yeah. I mean, people that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5264.8s	5264.8	 work at your house, you don't give them equity in your house, right? I mean, you own the house,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5268.2s	5268.2	 you give them cash. Or people who play for a basketball team are not allowed to get equity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5272.3s	5272.3	 in the team. But in other countries, right? I think in soccer, you can. Yes. But I think one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5277.2s	5277.2	 of the best things about Silicon Valley is the fact that there's a, there's a practice of giving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5282.1s	5282.1	 broad-based options to everybody in the company. And there's all those great stories about the chef
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5287.0s	5287.0	 at Google who got rich and the secretaries at Microsoft who got rich. And that is a beautiful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5291.6s	5291.6	 thing about the tech ecosystem. It's beautiful. It's wonderful. You never, and you never hear about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5295.7s	5295.7	 that when all the press is doing is writing stories about greedy VCs and all that kind of stuff. They,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5300.6s	5300.6	 they talk about VC, but they don't bring up the point that in these non VC companies, the employees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5305.4s	5305.4	 never end up with anything. Someone who came from nothing can afford a beautiful home and have their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5310.0s	5310.0	 life taken care of forever because they work really hard at a great company that worked out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5314.5s	5314.5	 And that's, that's the most common story and it's never reported, but yeah. And by the way, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5319.2s	5319.2	 there's, there's nothing wrong with bootstrapping your company. So congrats to this Mailchimp
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5322.3s	5322.3	 founder for doing it. I mean, certainly, you know, like as a investor, I have no desire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5328.4s	5328.4	 Just explain what bootstrapping is, Sax. Bootstrapping is just when you don't raise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5332.2s	5332.2	 outside money and he did it himself and he basically funded the company with the profits,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5337.1s	5337.1	 which is just amazing. But, but, but here's the thing about that is he did this. He started the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5342.3s	5342.3	 company back in 2001 at the nadir after the dotcom crash. And there was very little money going into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5348.0s	5348.0	 new starts back then. And he managed to create this. So kudos to him, but the environment now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5352.3s	5352.3	 is very different. If you look at the amount of funding that goes into startups, I mean, it's now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5356.7s	5356.7	 in the hundreds of billions every year. And so if you have this mentality of I'm going to bootstrap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5361.1s	5361.1	 it, you're probably going to lose to a competitor who's simply willing to raise money and pursue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5366.2s	5366.2	 that same idea with more funding. Now look, I'm not in the business of pushing money on people who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5370.8s	5370.8	 don't want it. I'm just saying realistically, the times are different. Now, if you can bootstrap a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5375.1s	5375.1	 business, great, go for it. But I do think that if you're in competition with someone who can raise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5378.8s	5378.8	 VC money, you're going to be at disadvantage. Hard to compete yourself. Yeah. What about AOC?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5384.0s	5384.0	 What she wore to the Met Gala? Tax the rich. She wrote, she was tax the rich dress to the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5396.3s	5396.3	 night of her life, parting her ass off with all these rich people. And she's wearing this tax,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76THi_c90o&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=88&t=5400.3s	5400.3	 the tax of rich. It's total hypocrisy. This is classic socialism where they do this virtue
