https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=0.0s	0.0	 Can I tell you a funny story? So I was in I was in and then I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5.4s	5.4	 when I landed there was a system message on the plane and then the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=10.6s	10.6	 pilot text me like, Hey, bad news. We're not going to be able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=13.8s	13.8	 to take you tomorrow. There's an error message and if we can't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=18.5s	18.5	 resolve it, we can't fly. Okay. So I text sax I'm like, Hey, dude,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=23.7s	23.7	 I'm in a really tough spot. Is there any way that I you know, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=26.8s	26.8	 can catch a flight, you know, with you tomorrow. Absolute dead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=32.4s	32.4	 silence. Three hours later. Paul pilot Paul text me and says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=37.7s	37.7	 Good news cleared us we're going tomorrow. I text sax right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=40.7s	40.7	 away. Hey, no worries. It's all resolved. In eight seconds. He
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=44.1s	44.1	 responds awesome with an exclamation mark. He had zero
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=50.6s	50.6	 intention of bringing me and my family with him. Zero. I feel a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=54.0s	54.0	 bastard. He felt a bastard. No, the truth is the plane was with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=58.6s	58.6	 me. I was using it. I'd be happy to let you borrow the plane if I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=61.0s	61.0	 not using it. Here's sax the last time we went to dinner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=62.9s	62.9	 Ready? The check comes Miller and Lux lands on the table. Here's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=65.7s	65.7	 sax what you're seeing. See that? You know what that is? sax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=69.6s	69.6	 going for his wallet. You can just count it. It's ironic because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=73.1s	73.1	 I can't remember the last time. He's almost the last time you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=76.0s	76.0	 picked up a check. J Cal. What do you every time I pick it up on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=79.1s	79.1	 the way in maybe for a slice of pizza. Come on. Sax is one of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=83.3s	83.3	 the most generous people I know. I remember we went to a bar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=86.0s	86.0	 once. We barely had time to get a glass of still water, a diet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=90.4s	90.4	 coke and some of the free nuts. And then J Cal was like guys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=93.3s	93.3	 it's on me. But we actually. I pulled out a 20. I gave it right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=96.7s	96.7	 to the bartender. That's true. My turn. My turn. I got it. My
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=100.3s	100.3	 turn. Jamath, you got the the white truffles and the filet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=107.8s	107.8	 mignon last week. I think these bar nuts are on me. It's only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=112.1s	112.1	 Yeah, throw in some cashews to throw in the cashews and raisins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=115.3s	115.3	 the trail mix. I'll get the trail mix because you got the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=118.4s	118.4	 truffles last time Jamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=120.7s	120.7	 Oh my god.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=138.8s	138.8	 All right, everybody. Welcome to the all in podcast. We're still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=141.3s	141.3	 here. Episode 105. I don't know if you saw boys last week. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=146.3s	146.3	 pod hit a new high watermark 16 overall in the world. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=152.4s	152.4	 congratulations. I thought we peaked at 14. Actually, was it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=155.7s	155.7	 1414 people listen to this pod. When I was in DC this week at a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=159.8s	159.8	 bunch of meetings and so many of the of the staffers listen to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=164.4s	164.4	 the pod. And they came up to me. They're like, Hey, love you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=167.3s	167.3	 guys. Listen every week. It's really great. It's really crazy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=170.0s	170.0	 actually the reach of this thing. It's really cool. Now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=172.8s	172.8	 when you're in DC, how gleeful were they about sacks is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=177.6s	177.6	 absolute shellacking last week that must have been high fives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=180.7s	180.7	 all over the dams like they won twice. Trump announced and sacks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=185.2s	185.2	 lost. Listen, we we talked about are they about SPF and how much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=189.6s	189.6	 money he gave them in order to stop that red wave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=195.3s	195.3	 I talked to a lot of folks. And what I would say is we talked a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=198.8s	198.8	 lot about energy policy. Life's life science is obviously two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=202.3s	202.3	 areas that I invest a lot of money in. And foreign policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=205.6s	205.6	 And actually, David, you'd be surprised by how many fans you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=208.6s	208.6	 have there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=209.0s	209.0	 Cool. Well, I mean, like General Milley, like we talked about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=211.6s	211.6	 last week, he's come around Jake Sullivan just this week, said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=214.9s	214.9	 that he told the Ukrainians it was reported that they can't have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=217.5s	217.5	 Crimea back get realistic. So Jake Sullivan and Milley are like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=222.5s	222.5	 the voices of reason now, the administration on this and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=225.6s	225.6	 they're just saying the same thing I've been saying, for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=227.8s	227.8	 which I was excoriated by the foreign policy establishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=230.4s	230.4	 And I got into a little Twitter spot with Ian Bremner this week,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=234.0s	234.0	 because all of a sudden he posts that Oh, everybody has been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=236.9s	236.9	 privately saying that we need to negotiate. No, no, you haven't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=240.5s	240.5	 You were criticizing you were denouncing Elon as a Kremlin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=244.1s	244.1	 agent when he posted that Twitter poll suggesting that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=248.4s	248.4	 the Ukrainians should negotiate. So you were publicly denouncing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=251.8s	251.8	 those of us who are calling for negotiations. And now all of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=254.4s	254.4	 sudden you're saying, well, this has always been the position. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=256.6s	256.6	 I think what's significant about that is the guy's just a weather
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=259.9s	259.9	 vane for the blob and the foreign policy establishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=264.3s	264.3	 And so the weather vane is now pointing towards negotiation. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=267.2s	267.2	 that's the good news here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=268.4s	268.4	 Do you think that if DeSantis wins the presidency, you will be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=271.9s	271.9	 nominated as Secretary of State?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=274.8s	274.8	 Treasury? What would you take? Treasury? State?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=278.1s	278.1	 So if you were offered a cabinet position, would you take it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=280.2s	280.2	 You should. You should take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=281.3s	281.3	 What you have to understand is that my position on foreign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=286.1s	286.1	 policy or Ukraine specifically is not it's not it's not adopted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=290.0s	290.0	 by either party. I mean, McConnell and the Senate Republican
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=293.9s	293.9	 leadership are very much on board with the Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=295.9s	295.9	 administration's policy on this. They are very, very hawkish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=300.0s	300.0	 It's really the uniparty on this issue. There's really just one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=303.0s	303.0	 consolidated blob.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=304.6s	304.6	 Okay, but back to the question, would you would it be a dream of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=307.8s	307.8	 yours? Would you find great joy in having a White House position?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=312.9s	312.9	 DeSantis goes in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=314.1s	314.1	 To serve your country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=315.7s	315.7	 Would you serve?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=317.6s	317.6	 Would I serve? If the president of the United States calls you up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=321.4s	321.4	 and asks you to do something, obviously, you have to serve your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=324.6s	324.6	 country. But it's not something I'm actively looking for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=328.7s	328.7	 That's a yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=329.4s	329.4	 What if he asked you to serve as the US ambassador to Burkina
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=334.1s	334.1	 Faso?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=335.8s	335.8	 Where?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=337.0s	337.0	 What?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=340.6s	340.6	 The ambassador roles are so funny. It's like you have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=342.9s	342.9	 compete for the good ones. And then some people get stuck with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=345.0s	345.0	 the bad ones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=346.8s	346.8	 Those are those are available for purchase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=348.9s	348.9	 Yeah, yeah, exactly. You know, there's like a there's like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=351.8s	351.8	 menu of these things like these ambassadorships. Like, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=355.5s	355.5	 think it's like written down anywhere. But it's kind of like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=357.5s	357.5	 unspoken. It's like if you want the ambassadorship to the UK,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=362.0s	362.0	 that's like $10 million. And then, you know, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=365.5s	365.5	 I mean, it's not affordable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=366.6s	366.6	 The thing with the UK and France, it's every every embassy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=371.4s	371.4	 every ambassadorship comes with an annual budget. But the cost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=375.4s	375.4	 of actually running that embassy and really throwing the parties
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=378.4s	378.4	 is much more so for the UK and France. The gap is 10 million a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=382.7s	382.7	 year that you have to fund out of pocket. So you got to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=384.8s	384.8	 really willing, you know, to put the money up. But apparently,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=388.3s	388.3	 you got to pay for the parties. My friend, my friend was was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=391.2s	391.2	 ambassador to the UK under Obama, and I went to a party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=394.9s	394.9	 party and I was like, Oh, my God, that's unbelievable. And he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=398.8s	398.8	 has the best life because like, you know, he was meeting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=400.5s	400.5	 everybody in the world, you can imagine goes through the UK and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=403.1s	403.1	 then wants to meet the US ambassador. It was a great job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=405.6s	405.6	 for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=406.1s	406.1	 Right. But the money I'm talking about is the cost of buying one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=409.0s	409.0	 of these cinecures. You have to typically raise that much. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=412.6s	412.6	 got to bundle that much money for whoever. This is what I've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=416.0s	416.0	 heard. I mean, I don't know. This is what I've heard is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=418.3s	418.3	 does that mean that SPF parents if Elizabeth Ward wins the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=421.2s	421.2	 best ship right now, the Illuminati right now just revoked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=425.1s	425.1	 all of our Illuminati cards, we're not supposed to talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=427.6s	427.6	 this guys, that you can buy an ambassador ship. But speaking of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=431.3s	431.3	 buying politicians and coverage, let's get an update on FGX. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=436.6s	436.6	 we're about Trump. Speaking of politics, I mean, you know, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=440.5s	440.5	 bring it up. If I bring it up, I didn't want to tell you in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=443.5s	443.5	 first five minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=444.3s	444.3	 The only thing I want to bring up is, I think I'm entitled to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=447.6s	447.6	 and I told you so on this, there was a story where the FBI said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=452.0s	452.0	 that the reason why Trump kept the boxes in his basement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=455.5s	455.5	 they've now the FBI has definitively said it's because he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=459.1s	459.1	 was just trying to preserve mementos, not try to sell state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=462.2s	462.2	 secrets to the Saudis or something like that, like some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=465.8s	465.8	 people were making wild conspiracy theories about so Jay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=469.5s	469.5	 Cal, it looks like I was I was right about that. In fact, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=472.3s	472.3	 think we had that very discussion on this pod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=474.9s	474.9	 Yeah, I mean, we I said I thought he was keeping it for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=478.1s	478.1	 like keepsakes like mementos. That was my position too, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=481.1s	481.1	 he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=481.2s	481.2	 a really you didn't you didn't support the Saudi conspiracy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=483.8s	483.8	 theory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=484.1s	484.1	 Let me ask a question because I mean, I wouldn't put it past
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=486.1s	486.1	 him. He's a maniac.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=487.3s	487.3	 I think if you believe that this was about mementos, which the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=489.8s	489.8	 FBI has now said it was, I think you also have to say that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=493.6s	493.6	 FBI's approach and raiding his home with armed, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=496.4s	496.4	 soldiers was heavy handed. Now, I'm not saying they didn't have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=499.2s	499.2	 the legal right to do it. I'm sure they checked all the right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=501.5s	501.5	 boxes. But it was heavy handed. But look, that brings me to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=504.5s	504.5	 another point, why do they do it? I actually suspect now that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=508.6s	508.6	 what the Biden administration is trying to do is keep Trump in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=511.2s	511.2	 the news. I think they actually want to provoke him to run.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=514.6s	514.6	 They want to run. It's the exact it's the exact same thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=517.5s	517.5	 Remember the 50 million that went into Republican primaries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=520.7s	520.7	 to support the you know, the election denier candidate. Turns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=524.2s	524.2	 out that was a successful strategy for them as much as I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=526.6s	526.6	 hate to admit it. It's as reckless as I think that was, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=530.3s	530.3	 hypocritical, because I don't think you can be out there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=532.8s	532.8	 claiming that these candidates are a threat to democracy at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=535.4s	535.4	 very same time you're funding them. So I think it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=537.6s	537.6	 completely hypocritical and sort of Machiavellian, but it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=541.6s	541.6	 worked. And I think in a similar way, what the Democrats are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=544.9s	544.9	 going to try to do over the next year is, is keep Trump in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=547.9s	547.9	 news as much as possible. And in fact, CNN ran his entire speech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=552.6s	552.6	 announcing last Tuesday, I think for this reason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=555.1s	555.1	 if Trump wins the Republican nomination, he's going to, then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=559.6s	559.6	 he will lose the presidency. Because if you look at all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=562.5s	562.5	 these exit polls that came out of these midterms, he's just so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=566.1s	566.1	 massively unfavorable. But that's not what's going to be,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=570.0s	570.0	 you know, litigated in the primaries. In the primaries,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=572.9s	572.9	 it's just Republican on Republican. And there are a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=576.3s	576.3	 non trivial number of paths where Trump actually beats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=579.4s	579.4	 DeSantis. And I think that's very scary to the Republicans who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=583.1s	583.1	 want to just move on and have a chance of actually consolidating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=586.1s	586.1	 power. And it's gleefully blissful for the Democrats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=590.2s	590.2	 because if again, and we saw this look, if the Democrats were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=594.0s	594.0	 able to fund and field MAGA candidates in the Republican
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=598.0s	598.0	 primaries that then lost in the general election, well, the best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=601.4s	601.4	 MAGA candidate of all is Trump. So it David Sachs is completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=606.7s	606.7	 right now, like the balance of power here should be if you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=609.9s	609.9	 the Democrats, whatever you can do to keep him in the news,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=613.4s	613.4	 whatever you can do to induce him to run makes a lot of sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=617.5s	617.5	 because he will, he'll cripple the Republican Party. Let's go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=621.5s	621.5	 it. He'll split.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=623.5s	623.5	 Look at how J. Cal's got a big red. He's admitting to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=626.0s	626.0	 hypocrisy, which is for years, he's been screaming about what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=629.6s	629.6	 is your boy? Hold on a second. You've been screaming about what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=632.2s	632.2	 a threat to democracy is how he's secretly on the payroll of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=635.3s	635.3	 the Kremlin or foreign governments and yet, and yet you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=638.4s	638.4	 want to keep him in the news. You want to be the nominee. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=640.3s	640.3	 you Republicans don't have the common sense to kick him out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=643.8s	643.8	 the party. No, I do. Come on. I was on the DeSantis train before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=648.8s	648.8	 the midterms election. You on this pod will never kick him out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=653.4s	653.4	 of the party. You should say how much I think we you guys should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=657.3s	657.3	 all disavow him publicly disavow him. How I've already said I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=661.7s	661.7	 support DeSantis. I said it before the midterms. What else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=664.2s	664.2	 do you want me to do? But by the way, I don't think large. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=668.8s	668.8	 think you're I think you and many other people on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=671.6s	671.6	 democratic side in the media are being very hypocritical about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=674.4s	674.4	 this because you want to claim that he's this unique threat to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=677.6s	677.6	 democracy while playing this game where you want to keep him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=681.2s	681.2	 in the news. You want to basically provide him with as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=683.0s	683.0	 much oxygen as possible because you think he's more beatable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=686.3s	686.3	 And by the way, I agree that he's less electable than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=689.3s	689.3	 DeSantis, which is why part of the reason why I'm on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=692.3s	692.3	 DeSantis train. I also think DeSantis would get more done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=696.1s	696.1	 But look, I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=698.7s	698.7	 gonna be the nominee. Did you see the new polling that came
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=701.3s	701.3	 out after the midterms? DeSantis is now the favorite in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=705.5s	705.5	 among Republican primary voters among every different slicing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=709.2s	709.2	 that you want to do of whether it's likely Republican voters,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=712.5s	712.5	 primary voters, whether it's Fox News viewers and on and on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=715.6s	715.6	 and on. DeSantis is now ahead of Trump by about 14 points.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=718.8s	718.8	 Hold on. I need to be able to state my position because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=720.4s	720.4	 Saxon interrupted me seven times. I just would like to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=722.3s	722.3	 my position on here. Number one, you all backed somebody who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=725.9s	725.9	 is a horrible human being who made terrible decisions and now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=729.1s	729.1	 you guys keep supporting him. At some point, you have to put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=731.7s	731.7	 your foot down and say, listen, we don't want this guy. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=734.1s	734.1	 have to publicly say January 6th, you know, and this guy's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=738.0s	738.0	 approach, the election denial. You guys have to come out and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=741.2s	741.2	 just say we don't want this person to run. I think you've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=744.3s	744.3	 been hedging too much. I think that's the problem. Now, who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=746.9s	746.9	 has I am not? How can I think the Republican Party? Yeah. Now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=750.4s	750.4	 you always were a little bit like because I did. Hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=754.2s	754.2	 And this very pot I asked you, if he run, would you support
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=756.9s	756.9	 him? Would you ever vote for him again? And you were like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=758.6s	758.6	 well, and you would vote for him again. If he wins the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=760.9s	760.9	 nomination, you'll vote for him. That's the truth. Republicans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=763.6s	763.6	 will still vote for him. Look, you know that before it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=766.1s	766.1	 popular before the midterms, I was on the DeSantis train. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=768.8s	768.8	 was saying so on this pod for over a year when it was very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=771.6s	771.6	 unpopular, certainly in the area in which I live. And so, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=775.6s	775.6	 know, and there are a lot of Republicans now, most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=777.6s	777.6	 Republicans now agree with me on this issue, according to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=780.9s	780.9	 polling that just took place. But if you win the nomination,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=783.7s	783.7	 you will vote for him. Jason is that you want us to buy into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=787.6s	787.6	 every bullshit narrative that you've ever told about this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=790.9s	790.9	 issue. January 6th bullshit. No, it was election. Let him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=795.9s	795.9	 finish. Let him finish. He's interrupting me every two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=797.9s	797.9	 seconds. Stay out of it. Free bird. Oh, I just want you guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=799.7s	799.7	 to guys. I just want you guys to speak and then let the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=802.0s	802.0	 person speak. That's it. I don't care. My point is just here we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=806.7s	806.7	 go again. I don't I don't want to rehash every single thing in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=809.2s	809.2	 the past. But but look, the point is that I think we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=813.2s	813.2	 more electable candidates. I think we have candidates that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=815.4s	815.4	 would get more done in office. But and I've already said so,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=820.0s	820.0	 but I you know, but I don't that doesn't mean I believe this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=823.1s	823.1	 whole like threat to democracy thing. I think that is massive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=826.6s	826.6	 inflation of the actual threat. But but look, if you want me to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=830.4s	830.4	 say that we have more electable candidates, we have candidates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=833.6s	833.6	 who will get more done, who frankly would be less alienating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=837.0s	837.0	 to moderates and independents and could even win over some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=839.7s	839.7	 moderate Democrats the way that DeSantis did in Florida to win
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=842.8s	842.8	 by 19 points. Yes, happy to say that. And I've been saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=846.6s	846.6	 that. I will just say if I if I'm if I'm if freeburg allows me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=850.2s	850.2	 to make a point, I would like to say it is a threat to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=853.2s	853.2	 democracy, January six and election denial. Those two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=855.6s	855.6	 things are acute. Why do you party fund over $50 million to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=859.4s	859.4	 those candidates? cynical because they wanted to win
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=863.2s	863.2	 cynicism, pure cynicism. Okay, we're on the same page about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=866.0s	866.0	 that. Yeah, yeah, it's pure cynicism. But do you let me ask
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=868.3s	868.3	 you a question is it and then we'll wrap on this because I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=870.1s	870.1	 know it's uncomfortable for freeburg to watch mommy and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=871.9s	871.9	 daddy fight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=877.5s	877.5	 some childhood drama.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=882.0s	882.0	 It's okay. Bobby, daddy still love each other even if we fight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=885.3s	885.3	 sometimes. It just makes me want to turn the volume down. Go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=887.8s	887.8	 ahead. We're almost done. Anyway, I do think fielding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=891.7s	891.7	 moderate candidates is the path and I think Chamath, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=894.4s	894.4	 brought this up a ton of times who it's the race to whoever can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=898.6s	898.6	 get that moderate middle and I hope that they feel better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=902.2s	902.2	 candidates. But do you think Sachs he's running? This is one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=905.9s	905.9	 of the cynical takes is that he's running because it will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=908.6s	908.6	 help all the legal cases against him. Do you think there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=910.5s	910.5	 anything to that? My guess is that that they see him as an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=913.5s	913.5	 easier candidate to beat and they're going to do everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=915.4s	915.4	 they can to try and keep him in the news and I don't I actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=918.8s	918.8	 I don't think that's your position. I actually think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=921.0s	921.0	 you're being sincere that you don't want him to win a second
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=924.3s	924.3	 term. I mean, remember, like we don't know. I think we all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=927.3s	927.3	 believe that we're going to have a pretty severe recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=929.1s	929.1	 next year. So just because the Democrats cynical strategy in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=932.8s	932.8	 the midterms are promoting, you know what they called election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=935.9s	935.9	 deniers in the primary that happened to work, but just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=939.0s	939.0	 because it worked last time doesn't mean it's going to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=940.8s	940.8	 next time and abortion absolutists and a whole bunch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=943.2s	943.2	 of other things. I think I think the point is pretty much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=946.8s	946.8	 this, which is that people gave Trump a lot of credit for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=950.6s	950.6	 being an idiot savant, but it looks like he's more of an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=953.6s	953.6	 idiot savant minus the savant. Okay, this is a this is kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=957.3s	957.3	 a goofball who has a brilliant media strategy and he had his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=961.3s	961.3	 finger on the pulse in a moment. And then he just couldn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=965.2s	965.2	 execute couldn't put two and two together couldn't put one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=967.7s	967.7	 foot in front of the other and he was way too divisive and he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=970.9s	970.9	 got booted out and he lost fair and square. And now what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=974.9s	974.9	 Republicans have to realize is if they don't figure out how to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=979.5s	979.5	 field somebody out of the primaries that is different than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=983.2s	983.2	 Trump, the Democrats will win because if it is Trump,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=986.4s	986.4	 whoever the Democratic candidate is, I don't think it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=988.4s	988.4	 really matters will crush Trump. Yeah, look, I think that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=993.0s	993.0	 likely correct. I mean, I think I think that we talked about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=995.5s	995.5	 it last week, you cannot win the presidency with call it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=998.4s	998.4	 45% of the vote. I mean, Trump is capped at that amount.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1001.1s	1001.1	 And the scary thing for Republicans, by the way, is Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1003.1s	1003.1	 does a much better job than anybody else in getting his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1005.6s	1005.6	 base activated. So the thing that all these polls get wrong,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1009.2s	1009.2	 and I think they've consistently gotten wrong and as a result
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1012.1s	1012.1	 have underestimated him is they don't give him the credit he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1015.6s	1015.6	 deserves duly for being able to curate a fervent base of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1020.0s	1020.0	 30 or 40% of America that will show up for him. And even if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1024.0s	1024.0	 they didn't show up as much in the midterms, they sure as hell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1027.9s	1027.9	 showed up in the primaries for his candidates oftentimes. So I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1032.8s	1032.8	 just think it's a very dangerous cocktail that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1035.3s	1035.3	 can't sleep on. So the Republicans have to take this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1037.4s	1037.4	 really serious moderate Republicans want to have a chance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1039.7s	1039.7	 of winning. You guys have to figure out how to beat Trump in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1044.3s	1044.3	 a ground game. Because if his base shows up, he has a decent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1048.2s	1048.2	 chance of winning the nomination. But then you will lose the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1051.5s	1051.5	 general. Yeah, I think that's I think that's pretty much spot on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1055.2s	1055.2	 I think Republicans really have to be smart and disciplined and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1058.1s	1058.1	 think about we have to nominate the the most electable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1061.9s	1061.9	 candidate. But here's the thing is we're not even debating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1064.8s	1064.8	 policy right now. No one, no one really says that, hey, on a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1068.5s	1068.5	 policy basis, there's a huge difference between, say, Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1071.4s	1071.4	 and DeSantis or some other folks. It's all about personal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1074.0s	1074.0	 style. And is it really worth it to the Republicans to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1077.6s	1077.6	 potentially lose the next election based on personal based
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1081.5s	1081.5	 on style points? It's a silly reason to lose, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1085.2s	1085.2	 William F. Buckley, a long time ago said that he would always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1088.7s	1088.7	 support the most electable conservative candidate, he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1092.3s	1092.3	 didn't always go with the most conservative candidate, he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1094.8s	1094.8	 wanted to go with the most electable candidate who met a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1101.6s	1101.6	 that. For example, he supported Bush 41 over Jack Kemp. I know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1104.8s	1104.8	 I'm going back a long way. But but in any event, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1108.9s	1108.9	 having thinking about electability is just really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1111.6s	1111.6	 important. There's one sub aligning here, the head of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1113.9s	1113.9	 Republican Party, Rupert Murdoch has absolutely dissed Trump. I

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1120.8s	1120.8	 cover of the New York Post a little lower like 10th. Florida
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1124.0s	1124.0	 man makes an announcement and on page 26, he had the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1126.9s	1126.9	 announcement of Trump running for president. And the funny
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1130.1s	1130.1	 thing was the last Rupert Murdoch, he didn't even name
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1133.9s	1133.9	 Trump as the presidential the absolute last line of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1137.6s	1137.6	 column. And he said, Oh, and he also happened to be the 45th
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1140.2s	1140.2	 president of the United States. Yeah, it was very funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1142.4s	1142.4	 You're seeing a lot of Republicans saying, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1144.7s	1144.7	 correctly, is that if you want to win elections, you have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1147.2s	1147.2	 look out the windshield, you know, not in the rear view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1149.6s	1149.6	 mirror. And what we saw in the midterms is that even talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1153.2s	1153.2	 about 2020 was at minimum, a giant waste of time and a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1157.0s	1157.0	 distraction and at maximum potentially cause these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1160.2s	1160.2	 candidates to lose. I mean, the fact of the matter is that a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1163.1s	1163.1	 lot of candidates, including some I supported in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1165.4s	1165.4	 battleground states who got lured into trying to relitigate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1169.6s	1169.6	 2020, they all got vaporized. And I just think it's stupid to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1173.5s	1173.5	 be talking about the past. Voters want you to focus on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1178.4s	1178.4	 future. And especially when there's no policy outcome that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1182.4s	1182.4	 matters that's at stake for you to be talking about a past
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1185.7s	1185.7	 election, instead of the future and the question is just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1189.6s	1189.6	 politically stupid. Freeburg, if I may bring you into this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1192.0s	1192.0	 discussion, uncomfortably as it might as uncomfortable as it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1194.7s	1194.7	 might be, would you vote for Biden? incredibly old, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1200.4s	1200.4	 know, it's gonna be 81 or 82. And the next election, do you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1203.2s	1203.2	 vote for Biden? Or DeSantis? As I go through the list of things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1207.2s	1207.2	 I'm most concerned about in the world today. Number one is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1212.0s	1212.0	 debt and spending cycle of the federal government in the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1216.7s	1216.7	 I'm I think it's the most kind of scary set of facts and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1221.2s	1221.2	 conditions that we're getting set up for kind of a major
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1224.4s	1224.4	 crisis 10 to 15 years from now. Because you can't afford all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1228.1s	1228.1	 the debt that we've taken on as a country, as well as the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1230.8s	1230.8	 entitlement as well as defense. And so something's got to give
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1234.8s	1234.8	 and there's a bunch of paths that could emerge from that set
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1239.1s	1239.1	 of conditions that are all really scary paths and not good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1242.0s	1242.0	 I'm more concerned about that than I am about nuclear war or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1244.9s	1244.9	 climate change. Just to be clear, because I think that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1247.8s	1247.8	 social effects and the global geopolitical effects that arise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1252.5s	1252.5	 from the US kind of destructuring because of our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1256.0s	1256.0	 debt and spending cycle that we're in right now are far more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1259.6s	1259.6	 significant than what we'll experience over the same period
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1262.1s	1262.1	 of time. And again, I do think that technology is going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1265.1s	1265.1	 resolve a lot of our issues and climate change and I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1266.9s	1266.9	 nuclear war cool heads will prevail. Everyone's got a family.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1270.0s	1270.0	 So that's what I'm most concerned about. So any kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1272.4s	1272.4	 voting decision I make is made with that lens, which is what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1275.6s	1275.6	 the best path to supporting some some sort of responsibility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1279.7s	1279.7	 setback or step back to resolve those issues. As Charlie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1282.5s	1282.5	 Munger said so well in this interview that was published
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1284.4s	1284.4	 this week, and I said it a few times on the show, but he did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1288.2s	1288.2	 or he's a much better speaker than I uses far fewer words.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1292.5s	1292.5	 But you know, in democracy, eventually the populace realizes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1295.4s	1295.4	 they can vote themselves all the money. And you know, that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1298.7s	1298.7	 what we see happen in an accelerated way in Latin America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1301.6s	1301.6	 We've seen that with a lot of these democracies that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1303.3s	1303.3	 ultimately resolve to kind of socialism. And in the US, we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1307.7s	1307.7	 seeing a lot of this behavior where we're kind of voting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1309.7s	1309.7	 ourselves all the money we're putting in place politicians and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1312.6s	1312.6	 the populace is saying I want I want I want and more money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1315.8s	1315.8	 comes out and it totally decreases the strength and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1320.4s	1320.4	 resiliency of our nation and our economy. And it's the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1323.6s	1323.6	 concerning thing to me because the incredible innovation and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1327.4s	1327.4	 economic engine that is the United States is threatened and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1329.8s	1329.8	 it really threatens a lot of stability in the world today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1333.1s	1333.1	 Trimoth any any final thoughts here as we wrap up the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1335.5s	1335.5	 political discussion? I thought you were obviously a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1338.7s	1338.7	 democrat so you're voting for Biden but you also care about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1341.2s	1341.2	 fiscal responsibility. So where are you at with your vote for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1344.4s	1344.4	 2024? I don't think that we know who's actually running on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1347.2s	1347.2	 either ticket yet just to be completely honest. So that's my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1350.0s	1350.0	 perspective. My other comment is I think what David said is so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1353.6s	1353.6	 spot on the single biggest issue that we have is that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1356.9s	1356.9	 have made a huge decision to de globalize and that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1361.8s	1361.8	 de globalization has the risk of introducing a hyper inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1367.0s	1367.0	 loop and we won't know how bad that is for another year or two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1372.5s	1372.5	 Why would it do that? Why would it well think about it this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1375.0s	1375.0	 way? De globalization costs hyperinflation. So today let's just say you buy a chip to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1379.6s	1379.6	 make the iPhone. You buy that chip from you know TSMC that makes it in Taiwan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1385.6s	1385.6	 ships it to China and the entire world is serviced with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1389.7s	1389.7	 that supply chain that keeps that chip as cheap as possible. Now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1395.6s	1395.6	 with the Chips Act as an example we will build resilient
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1398.8s	1398.8	 supply chains where now instead of one place it'll come from six places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1402.8s	1402.8	 Five of those six will be in allied territories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1406.0s	1406.0	 The United States, Western Europe, potentially Mexico.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1410.7s	1410.7	 The thing with that is that that now is six x more equipment that you're buying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1415.4s	1415.4	 Right? Instead of one machine you now have six machines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1418.5s	1418.5	 Instead of one person operating the machine in one country you have six
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1421.5s	1421.5	 people in six countries. As you can imagine when you layer up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1425.0s	1425.0	 all these costs there is no world in which that chip is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1429.9s	1429.9	 as cheap as it was before and so the cost of that has to be born
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1436.1s	1436.1	 either by the consumer who pays a higher price that's measured as inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1441.2s	1441.2	 or by the government who subsidizes it at the point of import
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1444.8s	1444.8	 that'll be measured by debt. And so one way or the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1449.5s	1449.5	 in our path now towards more resiliency and national security, which by the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1454.8s	1454.8	 I think is the absolute right decision. Okay? Energy independence, all of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1460.1s	1460.1	 stuff we have to do today. We are at risk of a hyperinflationary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1464.6s	1464.6	 loop if not managed well. And so you have to be really on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1470.2s	1470.2	 levers of the economy and you have to understand it deeply.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1473.3s	1473.3	 The person that deserves the most credit of preventing this hyperinflationary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1477.0s	1477.0	 loop right now is Joe Manchin. And hopefully the history books,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1481.2s	1481.2	 whatever Jay Powell does, I think has been good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1484.7s	1484.7	 But the fact that Manchin prevented six trillion more dollars of being pumped
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1488.9s	1488.9	 into the economy in the last two years is probably the single thing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1492.8s	1492.8	 prevented inflation instead of being peaking at nine from peaking at 15 or 16.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1498.0s	1498.0	 I think it would have been a national disaster without that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1500.8s	1500.8	 Chamath is right. That extra six trillion that Manchin's thought would have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1503.6s	1503.6	 a national disaster. But let's also give credit to every Republican because they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1506.8s	1506.8	 also voted against it. I mean, the fact that the pressure was on Manchin to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1511.3s	1511.3	 the thing and see the force from the trees and he did that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1513.6s	1513.6	 Yeah. No, look, I agree. I agree that I agree that he was in the hot seat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1519.5s	1519.5	 Well, so was Sinema, by the way. Sinema didn't go for the three and a half
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1522.5s	1522.5	 trillion build back better. But then Manchin, you went along with the $750 billion version
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1529.0s	1529.0	 of BBB, which they renamed the Inflation Reduction Act. That was kind of a disappointment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1533.6s	1533.6	 So frankly, like I give more credit to the Republicans, they were against all of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1537.7s	1537.7	 And the Democrats jammed it through. So if you're worried about all of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1542.2s	1542.2	 trillions and trillions of unnecessary spending, why don't you give the Republicans a chance?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1545.8s	1545.8	 I'm talking about the delta between what was spent and what could have been.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1549.2s	1549.2	 The entirety of the gap is really was prevented by Joe Manchin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1553.3s	1553.3	 I know, but it was Joe Manchin siding with the Republicans. My point is just look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1557.7s	1557.7	 neither party is perfect on spending. They both want to spend too much money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1562.1s	1562.1	 But at this particular moment in time, the Republicans are more restrained about spending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1566.7s	1566.7	 than the Democrats. Let's go to number one issue for each person. Hold on. Number one issue for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1570.5s	1570.5	 Freeberg is fiscal responsibility. I was going to say the same thing. It is my number one issue in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1575.2s	1575.2	 this next election. I want to see austerity, fiscal responsibility and get this spending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1579.3s	1579.3	 under control so that our kids do not inherit, you know, stagflation, hyperinflation or whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1585.2s	1585.2	 cocktail of disastrous economic policies we are handing to them. What is your number one issue?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1590.4s	1590.4	 Sachs for 2024. If you had to pick a number one issue, what would it be for David Sachs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1595.7s	1595.7	 Look, I think it's simple. The president's job is to ensure peace and prosperity. So you guys are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1599.7s	1599.7	 talking about the prosperity side. I think we do need fiscal responsibility. We need to have a good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1603.4s	1603.4	 economy. There's like a bundle of policies that go into that, starting with, I think, greater fiscal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1608.8s	1608.8	 restraint. And then on the peace side, I think we need to adjust America's foreign policy to be less
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1615.0s	1615.0	 interventionist. We're, you know, we're involving ourselves here, there and everywhere all over the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1619.4s	1619.4	 world. And I'm hopeful that what I'm hearing out of the administration in the last couple of weeks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1624.8s	1624.8	 from Jake Sullivan, from Milley, these are some good things that I'm hearing. But, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1631.0s	1631.0	 I would like to see us dial back on the foreign interventionism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1634.1s	1634.1	 If you had to 60-40 that or whatever, is one more important than the other or are they both equal and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1638.0s	1638.0	 then we'll go to Chamath? Both equal for you? Which one's more important?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1640.7s	1640.7	 They're both, I mean, look, how can you have a successful United States if we're either in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1646.0s	1646.0	 recession or at war? You don't want any either of those situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1649.8s	1649.8	 So those are your top two equally. What is it for you, Chamath? What are the issues for you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1653.5s	1653.5	 There's also a third one, which is culture, Jake Al. So this one's a little bit hard to categorize,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1658.2s	1658.2	 but I do think culture matters. And, you know, I want us to have a culture of excellence. I want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1663.5s	1663.5	 in the schools, for example, I think schools should have grades, they should have advanced math.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1668.4s	1668.4	 We should hold our kids to a high standard. I think that we want to have cities. We want to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1673.4s	1673.4	 you know, have cities where crime's not out of control. We need to have, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1677.4s	1677.4	 a sound border policy. So I think there's like a collection of policies there under,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1682.8s	1682.8	 you know, schools, crime, border that are sort of broadly cultural, I guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1687.6s	1687.6	 But, or maybe you could call them quality of life issues. So, you know, yeah, we need to have a good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1692.2s	1692.2	 economy. We need to stay out of foreign wars, but also we need to have a high quality of life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1696.7s	1696.7	 Can I steel man something for you? Because I really agree with those three things, David,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1701.0s	1701.0	 that you said, but I've spent a lot of time thinking about this in my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1706.3s	1706.3	 formation is that there's one thing that allows us to solve all three, if you bear with me for a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1710.6s	1710.6	 second. And I think that that is the energy independence of the United States. If you look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1715.9s	1715.9	 inside of what's happening in the U S today, the cost of generating energy is effectively as cheap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1721.5s	1721.5	 as it's ever been and as close to zero as it ever has been. And it's only going to get cheaper.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1727.3s	1727.3	 The problem that we have is that we have all of these decrepit laws and infrastructure and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1731.7s	1731.7	 regulatory capture that causes us to always be in an imbalance. And as a result, we do all kinds of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1738.0s	1738.0	 crazy things. We borrow enormous amounts of money to create subsidies. We go and we fight all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1743.6s	1743.6	 these foreign wars that don't make any sense. We wrap the energy problem and setting climate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1749.8s	1749.8	 change language, which causes this cultural division. But my belief, quite honestly, is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1755.1s	1755.1	 the reason the IRA was so important is as it is the most clarified piece of legislation we've seen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1763.2s	1763.2	 that essentially puts all forms of energy on a level playing field and has the chance to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1767.1s	1767.1	 America to permanent energy independence. And if the cost of energy is zero and we can abundantly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1773.6s	1773.6	 create it in the United States, what I think happens, David, is we have energy to rebuild
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1778.2s	1778.2	 our supply chain much cheaper. So inflation gets under control. We don't borrow as much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1782.4s	1782.4	 We have a completely different lens on foreign policy so that this interventionism and fighting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1788.2s	1788.2	 over resources is much harder to justify. And we put the climate change language aside and we use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1796.4s	1796.4	 energy independence as a form of national security, which gives us the courage to battle all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1801.4s	1801.4	 other cultural taboos that we otherwise have to say we agree with even if they don't necessarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1806.2s	1806.2	 make any sense. And there's a bunch of them. So I don't know, my answer to your question, Jason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1811.7s	1811.7	 is that one thing if we accomplish in the next five to 10 years has a chance to really change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1818.5s	1818.5	 the course of the United States. So I'm guessing then Biden's your vote because if it is in fact,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1824.7s	1824.7	 because Biden is the one who pushed for these clean energy tax credits and this policy in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1830.5s	1830.5	 Free work. What do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1831.8s	1831.8	 You also cancel our energy independence. I mean, look, we were energy independent based on fracking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1836.2s	1836.2	 You may not like fracking, but it did get us energy independent. You may think that there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1840.5s	1840.5	 environmental consequences to it that you don't like and that has to be balanced, but we did have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1845.9s	1845.9	 energy. I've never been against fracking. I believe in nat gas. I believe in coal actually as a bridge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1849.8s	1849.8	 fuel. I believe in all of these things. I believe that these are all more important than going off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1856.0s	1856.0	 all of these foreign lands and trying to justify spending trillions of dollars and putting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1860.7s	1860.7	 tens of thousands of American lives at risk, essentially for resources that we can actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1864.9s	1864.9	 create for ourselves at home. Well, I agree with you on that. 100%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1868.3s	1868.3	 I'm fine with clean fracking as a way, as a bridge, go ahead to getting to more independence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1874.6s	1874.6	 through nuclear and renewables. Go ahead, free work. Like I said before, China's declared that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1878.9s	1878.9	 they're building 450 nuclear power plants. The net cost, effective cost of electricity production
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1884.2s	1884.2	 out of a nuclear power plant is somewhere between one and five cents per kilowatt hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1888.9s	1888.9	 The U S on average is paying 11 to 15 cents per kilowatt hour. Nuclear is just through utilities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1895.0s	1895.0	 So free break that's with all the regulatory capture and all that trash that you have to spend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1899.3s	1899.3	 For example, we have to spend $220 billion a year to replace the power lines in America by law.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1905.0s	1905.0	 That's $2.2 trillion just there. Right. And so the cost for solar and wind off grid,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1911.6s	1911.6	 I think is around three to seven cents a kilowatt hour in that range. Right. So it gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1915.6s	1915.6	 nowadays it's gotten much more competitive, but I think that the nuclear solution is just not even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1923.0s	1923.0	 being engaged in the conversation. Now I want to go back to the previous point, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1927.9s	1927.9	 cause I didn't state the numbers before, so I just want to state them because they're so shocking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1931.6s	1931.6	 And this is what, what shocks me. The current federal debt is $30 trillion. Our GDP is around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1937.6s	1937.6	 $23 trillion. 5% interest rates on $30 trillion is $1.5 trillion in interest payments alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1944.6s	1944.6	 every year. And our social security. So, so $1.5 trillion. I mean, that alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1951.1s	1951.1	 is about 6%, 7% of GDP. So you have to tax every transaction in the country by six or 7%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1958.3s	1958.3	 just to pay the interest payments on the debt. And then we have Medicare and social security,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1964.5s	1964.5	 that math is wrong because you have maturities of all different types with different yield to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1968.6s	1968.6	 maturities and different coupons. So that's not, that's not today's numbers. It's what's happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1974.1s	1974.1	 over time. So as you look out and you look at the, the yield on treasuries and you apply that to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1979.1s	1979.1	 current debt level and the increment in the debt level, you'll get to that level, right? You'll get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1982.8s	1982.8	 to a trillion five a year in interest payments that need to be made plus another call it three,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1989.6s	1989.6	 four, $5 trillion a year in mandatory spending. And so that's where the country starts to run into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=1994.9s	1994.9	 a problem. Cause at some point when you have to tax so much to cover the cash payments that need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2000.2s	2000.2	 to be made by the federal government, the economy really gets hurt and things start to cripple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2005.1s	2005.1	 And then if you were to take those entitlements away, social security, Medicare, you have a real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2010.2s	2010.2	 problem with people's ability to support themselves in an economy where they're not working. These are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2014.3s	2014.3	 elderly retired people. So there is a mate at work to pay these expensive medical bills. So there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2019.6s	2019.6	 a major crash coming if we don't figure out how to bridge our way to this gap. So if someone wants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2025.4s	2025.4	 my vote and they're going to run for president, they would put up a simple chart like Bill Clinton
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2029.6s	2029.6	 used to do and show me a 10 to 30 year plan and just say, here's where we're headed. And here's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2033.9s	2033.9	 what we're going to do to make sure that doesn't happen. And that chart alone, I think can win the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2038.3s	2038.3	 vote. Okay, let's pull up the chart then. So here is the federal debt total public debt as a percentage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2042.9s	2042.9	 of gross domestic product. As you can see in the 70s and 80s, we were at under 50%. The 90s, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2049.4s	2049.4	 started, you know, growing. I don't think this matters. I think everybody, every self-proclaimed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2054.3s	2054.3	 intellectual looks at this chart and says, Oh my God, we've exceeded 100%. You know, the empire is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2059.7s	2059.7	 going to go to ruin. That's not why the empire goes to ruin. We have the reserve currency of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2065.5s	2065.5	 of the world. And there's an enormous amount of power that comes from that position. So what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2070.6s	2070.6	 right number is, is TBD. That's the most honest way to think about it. It was 100. It's at 150.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2077.1s	2077.1	 It could go to 200. Many countries operate at levels above us and still haven't imploded per se.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2083.2s	2083.2	 The real thing is what part of what Friedberg said is, look, if you really want to look at what we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2087.3s	2087.3	 pay today, we pay $400 billion this year. That's the interest payments. Okay, that's when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2093.1s	2093.1	 calculate all of the different maturities we have with all of the different coupons we have. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2098.2s	2098.2	 what we owe today. And David is right mathematically that if interest rates go to 5% and stay there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2103.9s	2103.9	 forever, but we know that that's not how economies work, they ebb and flow. Okay, so the real problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2110.4s	2110.4	 that we have to understand is how do you actually create enough growth? And then the next time that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2116.0s	2116.0	 we have a meaningful fall in interest rates, like every other person does, you know, look, a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2121.3s	2121.3	 people in America know how to refi their credit cards, refi their home loans, refi their mortgages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2127.7s	2127.7	 The United States could have had a much more aggressive and thoughtful strategy of refining
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2132.0s	2132.0	 by pushing out these maturities way into the future. And again, Trump actually suggested that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2137.1s	2137.1	 but because he sounded like a goofball, everybody said absolutely no way. But in hindsight, that one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2143.8s	2143.8	 move would have saved us trillions of dollars over the next decade if we had done it. And this time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2148.5s	2148.5	 around, we have to have politicians who are smart enough and have the werewolf fail to say, it doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2153.5s	2153.5	 matter where this idea came from. It's really smart. Rates are now back to 2% or one and a half
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2158.9s	2158.9	 percent. Let's now issue 50 and 100 year bonds. And let's refi this problem out into the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2164.6s	2164.6	 That makes a ton of sense. And we have to do it. The refi makes a ton of sense. Just to pull up a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2169.1s	2169.1	 chart here. And to counter your position there that it doesn't matter to mouth. Maybe you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2177.0s	2177.0	 respond to if you look at GDP ratios here. Number one, two, and three, Japan, Venezuela, Greece,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2184.2s	2184.2	 Sudan, and some smaller countries there. But the United States currently-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2189.6s	2189.6	 None of these countries. None of these countries. Look, this entire world runs on the US dollar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2195.2s	2195.2	 complex. Whenever we raise rates, yes, it is true that on the one hand, our interest payments go up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2202.5s	2202.5	 But proportionately and on a relative basis, I think maybe let me take a step back. Look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2207.3s	2207.3	 one of the most important things in investing, which is appropriate here, is that people ask,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2213.1s	2213.1	 what is the price of a stock? Well, before you go public, you're calculating what the intrinsic value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2218.8s	2218.8	 of a company is. All the things that they do, all the money that they make, here's what we think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2223.6s	2223.6	 it's theoretically worth. But the minute it goes public, the intrinsic value no longer matters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2230.0s	2230.0	 It's what is it valued relative to everything else? Okay. The United States is a relative,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2236.4s	2236.4	 if it's a stock, if all these countries are stocks, we are valued relatively to others,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2241.2s	2241.2	 not intrinsically. And the reason why we have so much power is because everybody else is actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2248.0s	2248.0	 valued relative to us. So this is why I think the right thing to look at, Jason, is the rate of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2254.4s	2254.4	 change of debt to GDP for the entire G8 or G20 or the rest of the world. And what you'll see is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2260.8s	2260.8	 something that goes up and to the right. Nobody in the world has been rewarded for not investing in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2266.8s	2266.8	 their populations and basically borrowing from tomorrow to invest in today's human capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2272.2s	2272.2	 Okay. So we have a disagreement here. Freeburg, you think this is a major issue?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2275.1s	2275.1	 Yeah, because I think you're also-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2275.9s	2275.9	 And Chamath, you think it's manageable? Freeburg, you have the floor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2278.4s	2278.4	 I think there's two things that are missing. One is the inflationary effect. So you look at that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2282.4s	2282.4	 list of countries that are there, they're paying higher interest and they're paying in the form of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2286.8s	2286.8	 inflation. So they have less that they can spend on their people. And ultimately what ends up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2291.8s	2291.8	 happening, it's just simple arithmetic. It's not about relative value of a currency. It's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2296.8s	2296.8	 arithmetic that we have a check we have to write every month to pay for Medicare and Social Security.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2302.8s	2302.8	 And it is written into law what that check needs to be. And the rate at which we're having to write
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2307.6s	2307.6	 those checks, the increment of those checks is going up so significantly that when you add on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2312.4s	2312.4	 the interest payments and you look at those checks and then you add on defense, something's got to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2317.2s	2317.2	 give because you cannot raise taxes in the amount that's needed to fund all of that outlay without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2322.7s	2322.7	 this causing either number one, massive inflation if you just take on more debt or number two,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2329.6s	2329.6	 significant loss of services, either Social Security, Medicare or defense. And so something's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2334.7s	2334.7	 going to give and the distribution I think is not being discussed. Sorry, just one point. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2339.3s	2339.3	 president's budget, anybody who is a president of the United States gets hold of their annual budget.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2344.4s	2344.4	 It's about five and a half trillion dollars this year. So you're talking about interest payments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2349.6s	2349.6	 that are still less than 10% of their total budget. Now that includes the entitlement payments. Okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2353.3s	2353.3	 so about three billion dollars, three trillion, sorry, three and a half trillion is what you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2357.2s	2357.2	 to pay for. Of 20%. No, three trillion dollars is the sum of Medicare and Social Security.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2363.0s	2363.0	 Okay, so the president still has one and a half to two trillion dollars of leeway, of which a quarter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2369.8s	2369.8	 are debt payments. So my perspective, quite honestly, is mathematically there's a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2373.6s	2373.6	 room to run here before these things get really out of control. And even if they do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2378.9s	2378.9	 I think the relative problem is for the rest of the world will be so egregious that the ability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2383.6s	2383.6	 for the United States to go to those banks and those economies and basically sell in more U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2389.5s	2389.5	 debt is quite high because they cannot afford to own debt in their own country. So if you think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2394.2s	2394.2	 that the United States is bad, go back to that list. Guess what? Those central banks in those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2398.3s	2398.3	 countries are going to be buying U.S. dollars faster than they can go out of stock. Unless we see some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2404.0s	2404.0	 union of India, China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Japan, Brazil, obviously not Japan, but some of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2412.7s	2412.7	 consortia will become a closer trading partner and perhaps could cause a shift in the balance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2418.5s	2418.5	 of the dominance of the U.S. dollar. And that's one path to consider.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2422.5s	2422.5	 Aaron Ross Powell Sacks, what do you think of the balance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2424.7s	2424.7	 sheet here? Obviously, we have two opposing opinions here from Chamath and Freiburg. Where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2428.0s	2428.0	 do you stand on the United States balance sheet? Are we over our skis?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2430.8s	2430.8	 Sacks Yes, the balance sheet is a disaster. What are we at? Like 130% of debt to GDP. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2435.8s	2435.8	 we have like 30, 30-30 trillion of- Aaron Ross Powell Sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2438.7s	2438.7	 Sacks Yeah, it's not even stable. I mean, we could add to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2440.9s	2440.9	 Aaron Ross Powell Our spending is 27% of GDP right now. 27%. It should be 15%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2446.0s	2446.0	 Right? So the spending- Aaron Ross Powell Where does that number come from?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2448.2s	2448.2	 Why? Sacks There's a bunch of economists who have shared these papers-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2451.4s	2451.4	 Aaron Ross Powell Morons, morons, morons, fake experts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2454.2s	2454.2	 Aaron Ross Powell Fake experts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2454.9s	2454.9	 Sacks No, no, no, no. Hold on, hold on. If you look at government tax receipts over time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2460.5s	2460.5	 with all different kinds of tax rates, including very, very different top marginal tax rates,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2465.3s	2465.3	 what you see is that federal tax receipts as a percentage of GDP is in the 17 to 19% range.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2472.6s	2472.6	 And like the best years you make 19%, it's usually in a good economy. And in a bad economy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2477.2s	2477.2	 it's like 17%. And it really, it doesn't matter whether Reagan was president or Bill Clinton,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2483.2s	2483.2	 and so on. So there's only so much blood you can get from a stone. And historically, spending was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2488.8s	2488.8	 around 19% of GDP. And so you would have a one or 2% deficit every year. And that really accelerated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2498.6s	2498.6	 First, you had the financial crisis of 2008. And then you had COVID. And Freeberg's right. We went
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2504.4s	2504.4	 from call it 20% of GDP spending to roughly 30% or more during COVID as kind of this emergency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2511.6s	2511.6	 measure. But like everything else in government, the emergency measure becomes a permanent program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2516.7s	2516.7	 So now we're at 27%. It doesn't seem to be going down. And the Democrats want a lot more. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2522.1s	2522.1	 we talked about it. Build Back Better would have been three and a half trillion instead of 750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2526.8s	2526.8	 billion if they just had one or two more votes in the Senate, which they now have. So hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2531.3s	2531.3	 So Freeberg is right. There's like nothing stable about the point we're at. The point we're at is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2536.8s	2536.8	 bad on its own terms, having 30 trillion of debt. Let's say that interest rates stabilize at 3%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2543.9s	2543.9	 That's still a trillion a year of debt service, which is more than the entire-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2546.8s	2546.8	 It's not a trillion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2547.5s	2547.5	 If interest rates stabilize at 3%, which is optimistic, and we're servicing a trillion,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2553.5s	2553.5	 sorry, 30 trillion of debt, that's roughly a billion dollars a year of debt service payments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2557.8s	2557.8	 Trillion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2558.2s	2558.2	 That could be spent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2559.2s	2559.2	 A trillion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2559.7s	2559.7	 That could be spent on other things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2560.6s	2560.6	 You guys keep saying billion when it's a trillion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2562.4s	2562.4	 It's a trillion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2563.5s	2563.5	 The average yield to maturity needs to be factored in there. So over a 15-year period,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2568.0s	2568.0	 David, you would be right mathematically. It's all matured. But that's not what this is because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2572.8s	2572.8	 you'd have to refi and reissue a bunch of debt that is at lower yield right now at these interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2577.9s	2577.9	 rates. I want to be clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2579.3s	2579.3	 I don't understand how any of this is good. I mean, remember-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2581.8s	2581.8	 Hold on, hold on. I understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2583.3s	2583.3	 All right. Let your moth say why it's good or control it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2586.2s	2586.2	 No, no. I'm not saying that this is a good or it's a trend. What I'm saying is I have this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2590.8s	2590.8	 issue that all of a sudden people make up, and you guys are doing it now, an arbitrary number
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2597.4s	2597.4	 with no rooting in history or fact and say, this is bad. And all I'm saying is I know it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2602.4s	2602.4	 feels bad to us, and I think we would all run this country differently if we could control the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2606.4s	2606.4	 balance sheet. I would as well. I would try to get debt way, way down. I would try to get deficits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2611.1s	2611.1	 way, way down. But all I'm saying is using this justification of an arbitrary number
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2616.2s	2616.2	 always falls flat. So I'm encouraging us all, let's find a better model of reasoning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2621.6s	2621.6	 Because every time we point to some randos book and say, 127% is bad. Nobody listens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2627.5s	2627.5	 And I think the message that you should take away is, is because it's imprecise and it's not rooted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2631.8s	2631.8	 in any actual logic. And if there's a better building-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2634.3s	2634.3	 The reason I believe that this is concerning is I look at the top 10 countries that have, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2640.1s	2640.1	 debt ratios that seem out of whack. And I think, wow, what has their fortune been for the last 10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2644.3s	2644.3	 years, vis-a-vis Japan and Venezuela? That's not the right comparison. The right comparison
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2648.0s	2648.0	 would be to go back and say, look at the British Empire. And when, and what was the debt to GDP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2653.7s	2653.7	 when it started to actually fall off? Does anybody give us a note?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2655.6s	2655.6	 Yeah, the British Empire collapsed. It collapsed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2657.6s	2657.6	 No, I'm saying- Okay, free birth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2659.1s	2659.1	 Was it triggered by debt to GDP? And I think your answer will be-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2663.8s	2663.8	 In part. They took on ruinous debt and they couldn't maintain their empire anymore and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2669.8s	2669.8	 whole thing collapsed. I'm just asking for some numerical specificity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2674.8s	2674.8	 All right. We're not going to get there right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2676.9s	2676.9	 Free birth was the last time that we- Yes, there was a lot of numerical specificity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2680.8s	2680.8	 There is a ton of work that's been done on this. It's not people pulling shit out of their ass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2684.9s	2684.9	 So tell us- So what shows that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2686.2s	2686.2	 historically the best way to manage the growth in a country is to have deficit spending be equal to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2693.6s	2693.6	 or less than the growth rate of the economy of that country. So for example, if your income,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2699.1s	2699.1	 the tax revenue that's being generated by the government is equal to say 15% of GDP,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2704.4s	2704.4	 you do not want your spending to be more than 17 or 18% if the economic growth rate is 2 to 3%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2710.1s	2710.1	 That's it. If you do anything more than that- So what happens?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2712.8s	2712.8	 No, if you do anything more than that, you're borrowing from the future to pay for today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2716.9s	2716.9	 That's the simple truth. Okay. So what happens?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2719.3s	2719.3	 And when you do that, the rates go up and the prices go up and eventually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2722.8s	2722.8	 your currency doesn't work anymore. What does eventually mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2725.6s	2725.6	 So you're making a bet. Read the book that I talked about last year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2729.6s	2729.6	 The most recent Ray Dalio book. He goes through six stories with the economic data to prove it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2734.5s	2734.5	 the factual data, the history of what's happened with six empires over the last 500 years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2739.4s	2739.4	 where this exact same scenario has played out. This isn't some random arbitrary story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2745.9s	2745.9	 Everyone had the exact same perspective that you have when they were living in those days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2749.4s	2749.4	 And they said, you know what? We're going to be okay because we're the reserve currency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2752.6s	2752.6	 And the world loves us and we're the empire and we have influence everywhere. And they all lost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2756.0s	2756.0	 primacy and their currencies collapsed and they all broke apart. And that was it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2759.5s	2759.5	 I'm not saying that that can't happen in America. What I'm saying is you get so full-throated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2764.0s	2764.0	 I read that book. It's great narrative, but the numbers are brittle. Okay. They're fragile and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2769.0s	2769.0	 they're mostly made up. Everyone can read it and make their own opinion on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2773.5s	2773.5	 So all I'm saying is in the absence of numerical specificity, I agree with you that this trend is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2780.0s	2780.0	 alarming and it's bad. I agree with you and I agree that we should spend a lot less. What I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2784.5s	2784.5	 saying is when you say to the world, stop spending because XYZ number is bad, you have no credibility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2791.8s	2791.8	 because it's not something that you can actually back up. And all I'm saying is if you could find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2797.6s	2797.6	 a better logical argument, you would probably get a lot more people to convince a lot more people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2802.8s	2802.8	 You're just being ignorant. You're ignoring it. You're saying you don't want to actually believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2805.9s	2805.9	 it. The numbers are there. Show me the numbers. And I'm not saying ignorant in a disparaging way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2810.0s	2810.0	 I'm saying you're literally just ignoring the data. Show me the numbers. Show them to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2815.6s	2815.6	 And Sacks, they get upset at us for fighting. I'll make you a PDF, Chamath. I'll send it to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2819.7s	2819.7	 tonight. I promise. And I'll post it on our frigging things so people can watch it. All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2823.6s	2823.6	 Listen, the group chat is going to be off fire this weekend. Sacks, final word for you before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2827.4s	2827.4	 we move on. Okay. Final word, please. Chamath and I have never gotten into it before like this, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2832.8s	2832.8	 obviously we're on opposite sides. I think it's great. I still respect and love you, Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2837.3s	2837.3	 Go ahead. If you go back in history and look at debt to GDP levels, the only other time we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2842.1s	2842.1	 anything remotely like the level we're at right now is right after World War II when we had just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2847.4s	2847.4	 saved the world from Nazism. Okay. That was worth going into debt for. You look today, what is it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2853.6s	2853.6	 that we've gotten into this 130% debt to GDP? What is this $30 trillion of debt for? What have we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2859.2s	2859.2	 bought with all that money? Huge amounts of it have been squandered. You're right. And Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2863.2s	2863.2	 wanted more. If the courts didn't stop him, he would have spent a trillion. You're arguing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2868.3s	2868.3	 Forgiving a bunch of student loans for basket weaving degrees or liberal studies or what have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2872.7s	2872.7	 you. So look, admit it. Quite the real enemy. Graduates degrees at Brown. All right, hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2877.2s	2877.2	 Let me finish. That's point number one is that this money is being squandered at levels we've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2882.3s	2882.3	 never seen before. And the squandering is continuing. It's not like we've reached a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2885.4s	2885.4	 steady state. It just keeps going and going and it will break at some point. I can't precisely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2890.4s	2890.4	 solve it. I can't precisely say when it's going to break, but I do know it's going to break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2895.1s	2895.1	 The other thing, the point number two is about consequences today. There is a phenomenon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2901.0s	2901.0	 economists call crowding out where when interest rates go up, more and more money flows into the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2908.0s	2908.0	 risk-free rate of return. And then that crowds out investment capital. And we've talked about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2913.8s	2913.8	 on the last pod where if the risk-free rate is 5% and then like high quality corporate bonds are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2919.6s	2919.6	 offering 8% to 10%, now equity investments must generate 15% and VC must generate 20%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2926.8s	2926.8	 And there are very few VC investments that can generate that kind of IRR. So what happens?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2931.4s	2931.4	 The money flows out of VC and there's less money for risk capital. What drives our economy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2936.3s	2936.3	 Risk taking and entrepreneurship. So hold on a second. So this massive debt service that we have,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2942.3s	2942.3	 which drives up interest rates will crowd out the very kind of economic activity that the United
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2947.4s	2947.4	 States needs to stay on the cutting edge. That is just-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2950.2s	2950.2	 Tramont, rebuttal. Rebuttal to the rebuttal to the rebuttal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2952.8s	2952.8	 No, you're so right. So why don't you just bookend the argument exactly the way you just did? My
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2957.7s	2957.7	 point is not that you said it just before that we don't know at what upper bound these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2962.8s	2962.8	 break or don't break. And all I'm saying is every time you throw up a random number,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2966.2s	2966.2	 you guys sound like the boy who cries wolf. Okay? And you're shouting into a vacuum. It's just the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2971.3s	2971.3	 advice that I'm trying to give you guys. I agree with you. I spend my entire days investing in and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2977.6s	2977.6	 trying to figure out what is the risk adjusted rate of return of the things that I'm doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2981.8s	2981.8	 And I'm trying to tell you as somebody with some reasonable financial numeracy, every time I hear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2986.0s	2986.0	 you or Ray Dalio or somebody else say, this number is where it all breaks and it doesn't,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2991.2s	2991.2	 you lose a little bit of credibility. Then you go to this number and you're like, oh, I had 127%-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2995.5s	2995.5	 Okay, we get your point Tramont.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2996.6s	2996.6	 So just be honest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2997.6s	2997.6	 Stop putting the number making up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=2999.2s	2999.2	 No, let me put it back to Tramont. How much is too much? How much debt can we handle and how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3004.4s	3004.4	 much spending as a percentage of GDP should we handle? What is the limit in your mind?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3010.7s	3010.7	 And how do you decide what that limit can or should be?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3013.0s	3013.0	 I think the honest answer is every time that I have been alarmed that we had hit a threshold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3018.4s	3018.4	 that was meaningful. So for example, like I think under Obama, we passed a hundred
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3022.5s	3022.5	 and it felt very scary because I was like, wow, that seems like a demarcation. It turned out to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3027.9s	3027.9	 not be a demarcation at all because it's relative to every other country and what they're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3033.4s	3033.4	 through. And I understand that you don't want to believe that, but I do think that America's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3038.0s	3038.0	 economic fatality is not an independent function. It is a dependent function on everybody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3043.6s	3043.6	 We are relative to everybody else. If there's a different cosmos and a different planet somewhere,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3049.2s	3049.2	 maybe this will all reset, but right now it's not. And so we all trade relative to the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3054.3s	3054.3	 And in that as much, I would like to just say, I don't know enough to guess what this number is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3060.0s	3060.0	 And I'd rather focus on what David said, which is there are things that we need to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3066.2s	3066.2	 that we need to incentivize people to invest in extreme risk-taking that create new businesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3071.9s	3071.9	 that move the world forward. You can have that conversation without bellyaching and crying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3077.4s	3077.4	 mommy about a GDP debt to GDP number, because every time you throw it out there, nobody knows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3082.0s	3082.0	 what you're talking about. Nobody knows what reaction to have. And everybody feels over time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3086.4s	3086.4	 David Friedberg, that you're crying wolf. So all I'm saying is, I get that it's concerning to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3091.3s	3091.3	 and it creates anxiety. But every time you probably, this is not the first time you've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3095.1s	3095.1	 had anxiety, you probably had anxiety at 50, 75, 100, 125. Guess what? I bet you'll have anxiety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3100.9s	3100.9	 at 150. I don't know what it means. I do know what SACS means though, which is that right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3106.0s	3106.0	 we have a risk-free rate that's going to five. We have corporate bonds that'll be at 10. We have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3112.4s	3112.4	 equity investing at the most risk-taking, which is the early stage venture that has to return 25.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3117.6s	3117.6	 And that is an incredibly high bar, but we need to do it. And we need to do maybe fewer investments,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3124.4s	3124.4	 quite honestly, with fewer participants, with less dollars that are more effectively put to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3130.0s	3130.0	 Okay. Maybe this is a good jumping off point to talk about all the waste in Silicon Valley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3134.2s	3134.2	 And that stuff can happen without debating incessantly this debt to GDP number, which honestly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3140.1s	3140.1	 this is subjective. All right. Freeberg SACS and then we're going to move. Go. I agree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3146.5s	3146.5	 I've never had anxiety about debt to GDP. It's never been anything on my radar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3150.7s	3150.7	 The conversation I'm trying to have today is the amount of spending, the federal spending,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3155.6s	3155.6	 including interest payments as a percent of the GDP, as a percent of how much we can tax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3160.8s	3160.8	 to pay all those, to make all those payments every year. And so what I'm concerned about is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3164.7s	3164.7	 the ballooning cost of paying out all the obligations the federal government has to pay out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3169.1s	3169.1	 You're saying something different than what you were just saying. If you were cared about only that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3172.9s	3172.9	 then refinancing the debt is an equally valid proposition and changing the duration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3177.8s	3177.8	 It's not the only expense. So interest payments are ballooning. In addition to interest payments,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3182.2s	3182.2	 social security and Medicare payments are also ballooning and defends spending.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3185.7s	3185.7	 Out of control spending. Everybody has their hand out. Everybody wants an air drive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3189.3s	3189.3	 When you add those four big categories together, you don't have any room left over to do all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3194.6s	3194.6	 You're talking about discipline in spending in defense. Great. I agree. You're talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3199.6s	3199.6	 about discipline and capping healthcare costs. Great. I agree. What does that have to do with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3204.0s	3204.0	 this other orthogonal thing you've been talking about, which is this random number debt to GDP?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3209.4s	3209.4	 It doesn't mean much. Let's move on from that discussion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3212.9s	3212.9	 Can we make one final point then we can move on? So look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3215.2s	3215.2	 Let's take time for the final point. Go. It's an important discussion apparently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3219.6s	3219.6	 In the interest of bestie harmony, I will partially agree with the point that your mouth is making,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3224.6s	3224.6	 which is that for a long time in American politics, people have sort of cried wolf
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3230.1s	3230.1	 about debt to GDP. For example, if you remember way back in 1992, Ross Perot basically based his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3236.8s	3236.8	 candidacy on the idea that the US was racking up way too much debt. You know what debt to GDP was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3242.9s	3242.9	 in 1992? 41%. Okay. So people used to care a lot about this. I remember when Reagan was president
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3249.8s	3249.8	 and Jets GP was 30%, people were saying that he was this like, you know, wild spender. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3255.8s	3255.8	 But I think that precisely because nothing broke at 30, 40, 80%, 100%, you then had the rise of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3263.5s	3263.5	 this theory called MMT or modern monetary theory, which said that the debt to DG debts don't matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3269.3s	3269.3	 If you're the reserve currency, you can print as much money as you want. And so people started
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3273.7s	3273.7	 indulging in this. And so now I actually think we are at a point. I can't say precisely where it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3278.6s	3278.6	 breaks, but I do think that because debt to GDP didn't seem to matter for so long, I actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3286.1s	3286.1	 think we got carried away. And now we're at levels, which are just going to be ruinous. If for no other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3292.3s	3292.3	 reason, then our debt service is going to crowd out whether you want more guns or more butter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3298.6s	3298.6	 in our federal budget. If you want more defense spending, you want more entitlements, you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3302.1s	3302.1	 more discretionary spending. There's no question that debt service is getting bigger and bigger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3306.9s	3306.9	 It's going to crowd out those programs. There's no question we need to spend less. I 100% agree with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3311.6s	3311.6	 you. Okay. Okay. But all I'm saying is we should spend less on defense because we have different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3316.1s	3316.1	 ways of defending ourselves. That should be the logical argument for less energy independence is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3321.6s	3321.6	 defense and a balanced budget could be defense as well. If you look at the IRA, that was less than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3326.8s	3326.8	 a trillion dollars over a decade. Okay. That has the potential to shift trillions of dollars a year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3333.3s	3333.3	 in defense spending. Yes. Okay. Okay. So let me wrap. Okay. Let me wrap here for a second. Thank
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3339.0s	3339.0	 you. Everybody. You can look at these bills in and of themselves and try to actually do the right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3344.6s	3344.6	 thing for the country without wrapping up all of these random arguments. And I, by the way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3349.7s	3349.7	 just to be clear, I don't believe in it. Don't do it. Don't do it. The world's worth moderator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3355.0s	3355.0	 Come on. I want to go back to actually during the Obama presidency, we had a thing called
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3360.8s	3360.8	 the sequester. I don't know if you guys remember this, but Republicans and Democrats agreed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3366.2s	3366.2	 that basically that because we had just had like these trillion dollar deficits because of the 2008
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3373.6s	3373.6	 global financial crisis, they got together and said, listen, we're going to hold the line
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3377.4s	3377.4	 on spending and there'll be no increase on defense spending in exchange for no increase in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3383.9s	3383.9	 discretionary spending social programs. And for a few years, we held the line on spending actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3389.9s	3389.9	 And then of course, both Democrats, Republicans didn't want that for different reasons. And the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3393.9s	3393.9	 sequester went away. We need to go back to something like that. There are two things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3399.2s	3399.2	 One detail. Like when you go and send a bill. So look, the way you pass a bill, right? You have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3403.1s	3403.1	 to send it to the CBO to get scored. One of the things that I learned this week is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3407.6s	3407.6	 sometimes the CBO and they're not really empowered to actually tell you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3412.0s	3412.0	 how things get offset. So for example, like if you have a medicine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3416.3s	3416.3	 what they will do is say, well, we'll look at the population level. How much would this medicine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3421.5s	3421.5	 cost if it's taken by the population? But if that medicine, then all of a sudden has the potential
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3426.5s	3426.5	 to actually off ramp you over here, those savings are not really factored in as well. So David,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3433.9s	3433.9	 your point, another way that we can refine how we build budgets to make sure that we're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3438.0s	3438.0	 overspending is to actually improve the toolkit and the data that like the CBO is given so that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3443.3s	3443.3	 when they score things, they can actually look at the total impact. Like for example, like the IRA,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3448.9s	3448.9	 again, one of the biggest benefits will be to defend spending. If we choose to make those cuts,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3453.3s	3453.3	 you will be able to do it differently. Once we have, you know, no reliance on foreign energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3458.5s	3458.5	 Okay, to wrap this segment, the first segment, which took 57 minutes. So obviously,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3464.2s	3464.2	 well, I think it's an important discussion. Hey, Jake, how would you vote for DeSantis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3467.2s	3467.2	 to be promised his fiscal responsibility? Well, here's the thing. I am going to take a look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3471.6s	3471.6	 the candidates. I'm going to make the best decision in terms of what I think is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3475.2s	3475.2	 best for the country. I'm answering like you, Sax. I'm answering like you. I'm giving no answers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3479.2s	3479.2	 What bullshit is this? It depends on- If DeSantis gives you everything you want on fiscal policy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3484.9s	3484.9	 why wouldn't you vote for him? If he stays out, if he's in favor of a woman's right to choose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3490.0s	3490.0	 For the first 15 weeks, that's Florida policy. Are you? Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3494.0s	3494.0	 You know, I would take a look. I would take a look. I honestly would take a look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3497.5s	3497.5	 What would cause you not to vote for him? 15 weeks, right to choose, combined with fiscal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3501.6s	3501.6	 responsibility. What's not to like? I'm voting for a moderate this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3507.2s	3507.2	 And tax cuts. I want a moderate. And tax cuts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3509.7s	3509.7	 Okay. But to wrap up here, the two things that matter, I believe, and based on our panels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3514.4s	3514.4	 discussion, austerity and excellence are what are going to get us out of this mess. Here is what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3518.8s	3518.8	 platform seems to be shaping up our 2024 platform control spending. Everybody here thinks that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3524.1s	3524.1	 important. Energy independence. Everybody here thinks that's super important. Stop fighting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3528.4s	3528.4	 unnecessary wars, and maybe rethinking our foreign policy. I think we all agree on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3533.6s	3533.6	 And the cultural focus on excellence, not excess. This is shaping up to be a little bit of an all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3540.4s	3540.4	 in platform here. Great discussion, everybody. Speaking of austerity measures, I think, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3546.4s	3546.4	 we should just talk right, right up top here about what's going on at Google. Chris Hone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3551.5s	3551.5	 I believe is how you pronounce his name. Chris Hone, he sent a letter to Google and Amazon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3556.1s	3556.1	 Amazon today, after already announcing 10,000 layoffs, they just said again, Andy said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3562.3s	3562.3	 prepare for more layoffs in 2023. And these are not factory workers. These are white collar,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3568.8s	3568.8	 high paying jobs that are being laid off here. They're surplus elites.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3573.4s	3573.4	 Surplus elites. It is definitely a part of the zeitgeist right now. So they're going to reduce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3580.0s	3580.0	 headcount massively. But in this letter to shareholders, he points out, notably not just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3585.8s	3585.8	 Hey, Google needs to do a riff a reduction in force. But he points out a more granular point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3590.8s	3590.8	 that I want the panel to talk about here, which is, he says, Hey, you need to reduce the actual
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3596.0s	3596.0	 salaries at Google, the average salary being $296,000 67% higher than an incredibly well paying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3606.1s	3606.1	 workforce, Microsoft quote, we acknowledge that alphabet employ some of the most talented and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3610.8s	3610.8	 brightest computer scientists and engineers. But these represent only a fraction of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3614.8s	3614.8	 employee base, many employees are performing general sales, marketing and administrative jobs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3619.2s	3619.2	 who should be compensated in line with other technology companies. And he says we need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3624.6s	3624.6	 establish an EBITDA margin target, as you can see in this chart, and reduce the losses on other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3631.6s	3631.6	 bets, perhaps increasing share buybacks as well. So what we're looking at here, now after what an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3638.1s	3638.1	 incredible business my god, I mean, the business is nuts. Freeburg, you worked there, what in this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3644.6s	3644.6	 range true to you? Or not? And then how many people does Google need to employ to operate the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3654.6s	3654.6	 business and invest in the future of the business in your mind, they have 187,000 employees at Google,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3663.2s	3663.2	 it's grown 24.5% rounded up 25% year over year, they grew 25% year over a year, in their business,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3673.2s	3673.2	 how many people need to run this business to have it aggressively grow? Look, I think there are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3679.5s	3679.5	 two main drivers of the issue that Google, maybe meta, maybe Twitter, prior to Elon's involvement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3689.0s	3689.0	 and really Silicon Valley as a whole, the bigger companies have faced the first is the war for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3694.5s	3694.5	 talent. The war for talent started, I mentioned this last time around 2004 2005. Because prior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3702.7s	3702.7	 to that, there weren't as many grads coming out of undergrad with computer science degrees, right? I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3707.6s	3707.6	 think 10% of grads in the Bay Area schools were finishing with computer science degrees. Today,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3712.8s	3712.8	 the numbers like 60%. So you know, around that time, the war for talent led organizations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3718.9s	3718.9	 particularly Google down a path of offering more perks and benefits to their employees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3724.1s	3724.1	 to create a workplace that was more competitive. And that ends up being a slippery slope, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3729.3s	3729.3	 then other organizations try and find parity, and then other organizations try and overdo it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3733.6s	3733.6	 and push it even further. So this leads to both wage inflation across the the ecosystem, but it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3742.0s	3742.0	 also led to almost like the acceptance or the allowance for degrees of complacency. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3750.7s	3750.7	 I'm not saying that the workforce is all complacent. But I do think that complacency is forgiven some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3756.8s	3756.8	 amount of complacency, I'm going to take a Friday off, I'm going to take two Fridays off, all of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3761.0s	3761.0	 sudden, I'm not working any Fridays. The other thing that's happened is as this workforce has aged,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3766.3s	3766.3	 I worked at Google 20 years ago. And a lot of the folks I work with, almost all of them now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3771.8s	3771.8	 have families. At the time, everyone was young. And as the demographics of Silicon Valley has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3777.3s	3777.3	 matured, you have more people that are less about killing themselves and giving everything that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3782.4s	3782.4	 have to their organization. And they're more interested in being with their families and now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3786.9s	3786.9	 spending less time at work, especially in light of the fact that compensation has ballooned to a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3791.8s	3791.8	 point that you can now live a very, very comfortable lifestyle. And you don't need to have a big payday
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3796.5s	3796.5	 in order to be able to take really good care of your family, which was the case as a startup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3800.3s	3800.3	 And then the other issue is just one of innovation. At Google, if you work on a new project, and it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3805.5s	3805.5	 doesn't work, there's no loss, you still have your job. And they've started programs where they'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3810.6s	3810.6	 give you equity and new startup ideas, or they'll give you all the stuff. So they'll give you upside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3814.7s	3814.7	 if you win, they'll give you bonuses if it succeeds, but there's no downside. And so the pain and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3819.6s	3819.6	 burn that you would feel as a startup founder, or as someone building a new business isn't experienced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3824.3s	3824.3	 to realize. And I cannot, I don't need to tell you guys this, but for anyone else that's listening,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3828.6s	3828.6	 that may not really be fully aware, the lack of pain, the lack of risk, the lack of downside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3833.4s	3833.4	 the lack of having no safety net and, and falling through the pits, removes all so much of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3840.6s	3840.6	 incentive to succeed, and to drive and to innovate. And I think that's become part of the complacency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3845.8s	3845.8	 problem that's caused larger organizations to simply say, let's throw more heads at the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3850.8s	3850.8	 And when you just throw more heads at the problem, you have more of kind of talent war problem that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3855.1s	3855.1	 I mentioned number one, what is the average salary? 280,000? 300,000 rounded up. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3860.8s	3860.8	 That doesn't cloud. I don't know if that includes benefits, whatever, let's just call it 300,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3864.5s	3864.5	 Yeah. And by the way, that doesn't mean that those people should all get fired. But I think it speak,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3869.8s	3869.8	 it speaks to the fact I think they're wonderful people. They're some of my best friends work at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3873.2s	3873.2	 Google. It's a great organization, people do incredible work there. But in terms of return
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3878.1s	3878.1	 of dollars invested as a shareholder, that's the question. That's the that's the analysis. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3883.1s	3883.1	 the scope that the shareholder is looking at is do I want to spend a dollar to make $1.5? Or do I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3889.2s	3889.2	 only want to spend a dollar where I know I'm going to get $1.80 back? And so if you just bucketed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3893.6s	3893.6	 where the dollars are going, you would end up saying, you know what, I'd rather just focus on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3898.3s	3898.3	 the places where I spend a dollar and I get $2 back or $1.80 back. And I don't want to do any of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3902.1s	3902.1	 the stuff where I spend a dollar and make $1.5 back. And that's called ROIC or return on invested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3906.6s	3906.6	 capital. And that includes return on invested human capital. And so the analyst in the stock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3912.0s	3912.0	 that that's an investor in the stock will look at it through that lens. Whereas everyone that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3916.4s	3916.4	 working there is still contributing meaningfully, they're still doing valuable work. But in terms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3920.5s	3920.5	 of return on invested capital, a good chunk of the projects are not driving the majority of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3925.7s	3925.7	 value, a minority of the projects and minority of the headcount is driving almost all the value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3930.6s	3930.6	 I mean, if you sensitized it to what you said, David, a if it was just 75 or a half that number,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3938.5s	3938.5	 then you know, the stock goes up 35% overnight. And if it goes up to the full number,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3943.8s	3943.8	 Yep, the stock goes up 65% overnight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3948.4s	3948.4	 I think that's totally feasible. And then and then I think what you do is you take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3953.0s	3953.0	 $10 billion a year, and you have a high accountability model that you speak to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3956.9s	3956.9	 street about. And you say, here's how we're going to hold ourselves accountable to investing this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3960.5s	3960.5	 $10 billion every year, and not just have everything be a nebulous 15 year project. And then it's always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3966.0s	3966.0	 a 15 year project. And you're always just burning cash to go after those projects that are highly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3970.1s	3970.1	 nebulous. If you had to steel man the other side, I think the argument would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3976.2s	3976.2	 I would say they would make probably three arguments. Argument number one is like, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3981.0s	3981.0	 don't get overly distracted by other bets, because it's a small category of spend. And we've contained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3986.0s	3986.0	 that cost pretty rationally, relative to the rest of the core business. The second thing that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3992.1s	3992.1	 would probably say is, there's an enormous amount of work that is never seen by Wall Street that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=3998.1s	3998.1	 explains how good our services, whether that's, you know, in early iterations of, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4004.4s	4004.4	 technical capability like GFS and Bigtable to things like TPU to things like TensorFlow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4010.0s	4010.0	 And all of that builds up all the things that DeepMind does all the compute we have to throw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4015.0s	4015.0	 against search to support that. So I think they would probably say, well, people probably don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4019.4s	4019.4	 have a great sense of today, that it's not just 25% of the team that's required. And then the third
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4025.6s	4025.6	 thing is what they would probably say is, it's very hard to explain, but Google has all kinds of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4030.8s	4030.8	 other things that they do for free to create the ecosystem so that the internet works well. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4036.5s	4036.5	 know, I heard this one thing where somebody was explaining that Google is like, you know, the DNS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4042.4s	4042.4	 server, right? Google is the time server and all of this stuff they do for free. And all of it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4047.1s	4047.1	 just about making the internet work more efficiently. And that has some costs. So that's probably how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4052.0s	4052.0	 they would steel man how to build back up to some number. But it's probably there's still a gap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4056.8s	4056.8	 between that number of David and what their prevailing headcount is. Yeah, I think that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4061.4s	4061.4	 totally true, because the infrastructure team led by Urs is the most remarkable engineering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4066.0s	4066.0	 organization on planet Earth, in my opinion. And they have laid fiber lines across the Atlantic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4072.0s	4072.0	 they have built their own data center infrastructure, their own switches, their own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4076.5s	4076.5	 silicon, like everything is built by this team from the ground up from first principles, and it gives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4081.7s	4081.7	 extraordinary motes and advantages to the business. It makes the internet a better place. It allows,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4086.1s	4086.1	 you know, ultra fast, super cheap YouTube video viewing across the internet. I mean, there's just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4090.4s	4090.4	 so much of these core advantages in the business. But if you look at the headcount over time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4095.6s	4095.6	 you have to ask yourself the question, you know, how many of these investments that are core
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4101.1s	4101.1	 are really, you know, captured in the headcount that blossomed from 2013 47,000 people so that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4108.1s	4108.1	 the business has gone up in headcount by four x in the last nine years. One of the things that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4113.5s	4113.5	 Jeff Bezos was always so incredible at, and I saw him give a speech on this at one point, Bezos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4118.4s	4118.4	 gave a speech that I saw and he said, we are really good at failing. And he showed all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4123.4s	4123.4	 projects that Amazon tried. And he said, we tried a nine, we tried to do our own search, we tried to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4128.4s	4128.4	 build our own cell phone, the fire phone, we tried to do this, we tried to do that. When they don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4133.3s	4133.3	 work, we kill them. And when they did work, they became hundred multi hundred billion dollar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4137.8s	4137.8	 enterprise value creators for them, like AWS, which was one of these projects. And so Amazon was so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4143.6s	4143.6	 good at taking the stuff that wasn't working, knowing when it wasn't working and ending it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4148.4s	4148.4	 and they were still able to drive an innovation engine. One of the challenges I see with alphabet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4153.4s	4153.4	 is that they are so good at bringing the best talent to work on these innovation problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4157.2s	4157.2	 But where they're not good is saying, you know what, this isn't working, it's time to move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4161.5s	4161.5	 And if they did just that, if they added that one disciplinary capability,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4165.3s	4165.3	 then I think this, as you said, the market cap would go up by $600 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4170.4s	4170.4	 I just want your reaction to this thing that a lot of people whisper in Silicon Valley,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4175.1s	4175.1	 which is part of what the big companies should do. It's part of the positive game theory,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4180.0s	4180.0	 is to not let these talented people actually leave. It's better to pay them 300,000 or 200,000 or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4185.6s	4185.6	 whatever and stay at Microsoft and Meta and Google or whatnot, then go off and start up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4192.4s	4192.4	 build a startup that could actually then disrupt them. And so, you know, it's a cost worth bearing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4197.7s	4197.7	 because it's actually a blocker strategy. Yeah. What do you think about that, Reaver?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4202.2s	4202.2	 Super interesting idea. I think that the people that are likely going to actually be able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4208.4s	4208.4	 execute on that are going to leave and do it anyway. Right. They're surely aggressive entrepreneurs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4214.2s	4214.2	 are not going to be blocked. Look, I was not super, I had made a little money when I worked at Google,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4218.9s	4218.9	 but I was not super wealthy. And I left the vast majority of my stock options and RSUs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4224.6s	4224.6	 on the table when I left Google in 2006 to start Climate Corp. Because I could not help,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4229.2s	4229.2	 but do that. I could not help myself. I had to go do that thing. Of course. And I think the kinds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4233.3s	4233.3	 of people that are going to succeed in entrepreneurism cannot help themselves. It doesn't matter how much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4238.8s	4238.8	 money is being thrown at them. Here's the chart. Basically, these companies have been correlating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4243.0s	4243.0	 their spend and their headcount to their revenue, not what's necessary. You look at Alphabet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4249.0s	4249.0	 total employee change since 2018, 95.36%. I mean, I don't know. That looks pretty good to me. Revenue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4255.8s	4255.8	 132%. It's pretty good. It doesn't look like they were massively over hiring, if you ask me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4262.4s	4262.4	 Yeah, totally. So what are you guys talking about? So maybe I'm wrong. I will say, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4267.2s	4267.2	 a big part of Larry Page's decision to shift the company from Google to Alphabet was he believed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4273.6s	4273.6	 that the core business at some point would ultimately be disrupted, that the core advertising engine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4278.2s	4278.2	 was going to be disrupted, and there wasn't going to be the sustaining long-term growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4281.9s	4281.9	 advantage in that business. Maybe he's been disproven or maybe it hasn't been proven yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4287.2s	4287.2	 But the concept was we need to find the next Google and we need to build the next Google.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4291.5s	4291.5	 And so we want to allocate capital within a portfolio of bets and have some number of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4296.1s	4296.1	 things, maybe not all of them, maybe not even a lot of them, maybe just one or two of them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4300.8s	4300.8	 turn into the next hundred billion dollar revenue line for us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4304.4s	4304.4	 Now, he always said that that's going to take a long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4307.6s	4307.6	 He definitely underestimated the quality of Google search and the dominance of it. Now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4314.9s	4314.9	 it probably stands to reason that if we have enough innovation at the fundamental model level in AI,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4321.8s	4321.8	 particularly like a bunch of really powerful multimodal models, the new form of search
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4326.6s	4326.6	 can disrupt Google. But the problem is they are so ahead of everybody else with respect to those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4332.6s	4332.6	 models as well. So the real question is even that next big leapfrog isn't going to happen without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4338.8s	4338.8	 billions of dollars of capital invested. And the most likely folks that are able to do it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4343.5s	4343.5	 I think OpenAI at some level, but again, they're going to always have to raise money from other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4348.1s	4348.1	 folks. Google can self-fund it and it makes an enormous amount of sense to drive that technical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4353.1s	4353.1	 mode. So it just seems like Larry may have just been wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4356.0s	4356.0	 What do we think is going to happen here? Are they going to make the cuts or not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4359.5s	4359.5	 Do they have the ability to not make cuts and just ignore a 6% shareholder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4365.9s	4365.9	 Chamath or are they just going to make them and then we're going to go on to your sacks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4368.1s	4368.1	 I'll tell you, the dynamic will be how much Ruth is able to convey. Ruth Porat is the CFO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4374.9s	4374.9	 She's hardcore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4376.0s	4376.0	 She's incredibly, everyone on that leadership team is incredibly impressive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4380.5s	4380.5	 but she has a very particular lens, a Wall Street lens, and she understands what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4386.1s	4386.1	 shareholders are thinking and looking at. And she will convey these points to the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4391.2s	4391.2	 And there will be engineers and Sundar is an engineer and he's very good at gathering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4396.8s	4396.8	 the different points of view and having balance around this. And he will share his points of view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4400.4s	4400.4	 with the board. And I think ultimately it will come down to, my guess is like we just talked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4406.2s	4406.2	 about some portfolio allocation decisions, which is how much risk and how much beta,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4411.1s	4411.1	 how much alpha and do we have the right mix in our portfolio? And it is inevitable there's going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4415.4s	4415.4	 be some cutting. So I think that there will likely be some reduction. 5%, 10%, 10,000 employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4422.4s	4422.4	 That seems like the number that people are going with. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4426.8s	4426.8	 Okay. Sax, what's your take on austerity measures and moving to an age of excellence and efficiency,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4433.9s	4433.9	 which is happening inside of the tech industry as we speak?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4438.4s	4438.4	 I think Freeberg's right that these companies could operate a lot more efficiently. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4442.0s	4442.0	 there's an economic argument there, but I want to uplevel it and talk about the cultural aspect of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4446.5s	4446.5	 this for a second and also bring in two of the huge stories this week, the SBF story, the interviews
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4453.2s	4453.2	 he did with the New York Times and Vox, and then this hysteria around what's happening at Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4460.6s	4460.6	 Look, I think that something clearly has hit a nerve here in this last week where you have all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4467.7s	4467.7	 of these employees who have voluntarily left creating all of this drama. Antonio Garcia Martinez
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4477.1s	4477.1	 had a good quote about this. He said, what Elon is doing is a revolt by entrepreneurial capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4480.8s	4480.8	 against the professional managerial class regime that otherwise everywhere dominates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4484.6s	4484.6	 And that same PMC, which includes the media, is treasoning it as an act of les majesté.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4489.2s	4489.2	 There's another version of this that came out a couple of weeks ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4491.6s	4491.6	 And by the way, les majesté just means like you're insulting the monarch, the ruling class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4496.0s	4496.0	 You're insulting the crown. There's a good one here. There's an article on Compact Magazine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4502.4s	4502.4	 a couple of weeks ago where the editor, Jeff Schoenberger, tweeted, the layoffs at Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4507.5s	4507.5	 are no different than what's happening across Silicon Valley. But because the ideological
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4510.9s	4510.9	 antagonism of the professional left to Musk, they make clear what's at stake,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4514.8s	4514.8	 the collapse of a jobs program for surplus elites. And then there's a great quote from this article.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4522.0s	4522.0	 My God, that's so hard hitting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4525.4s	4525.4	 I know. It hits a deep nerve. I'll get into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4528.8s	4528.8	 It hits differently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4529.4s	4529.4	 Yeah, exactly. So a quote from this article said, one of the biggest and least talked about social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4533.7s	4533.7	 questions in the West is how to economically provide for our own modern version of France's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4538.2s	4538.2	 imprecunious nobles. That is how to prop up high status people who can't really do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4543.4s	4543.4	 much economically productive work. Wow. I mean, like this was pretty brutal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4549.8s	4549.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4550.0s	4550.0	 Yeah. So listen, I think this is really hitting a nerve because the fundamental quid pro quo of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4556.4s	4556.4	 our civilization is that in order to achieve economic and social advancement, you go to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4563.1s	4563.1	 college and get a degree and you submit to voluntary reeducation of yourself at one of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4569.7s	4569.7	 these woke madrasas, one of these reeducation camps. That's a quid pro quo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4574.1s	4574.1	 Stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4574.9s	4574.9	 And you get a degree. Now some people-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4577.4s	4577.4	 Did your punch up guy write that intro?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4579.1s	4579.1	 No, no. Look, this is what I've believed for a while. Now, there are some number of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4585.6s	4585.6	 who get useful degrees like computer science or engineering, but huge numbers of people get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4590.8s	4590.8	 degrees like we talked about, the basket weaving or whatever the politically correct degree is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4596.8s	4596.8	 and they graduate with a quarter million dollars in debt and no marketable skills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4602.6s	4602.6	 And what was propping up all of these people were these fantastically wealthy monopolies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4608.8s	4608.8	 tech companies that were hiring huge numbers of these people. Now, all of a sudden we get to a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4613.6s	4613.6	 point where we're in an economic recession and these companies are starting to do layoffs and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4618.8s	4618.8	 they're starting to do a little bit more soul searching about who's really adding value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4623.9s	4623.9	 And people are starting to get laid off. And I think this hysteria is coming from a place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4628.5s	4628.5	 of deep insecurity. You had all these people go to college, they did not learn critical thinking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4633.6s	4633.6	 skills. What they learned was that, listen, if we pay lip service to the right platitudes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4639.3s	4639.3	 then we will have career advancement. And now they're learning that that may not be true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4643.8s	4643.8	 And actually the person who's pulled the mask off this entire regime is none other than SPF.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4650.2s	4650.2	 And he did it in an interview with Vox and we have to go to this. Okay. He said he's the devil, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4657.4s	4657.4	 he basically pulled the mask off this whole civilizational quid pro quo that is a sham.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4663.0s	4663.0	 Okay. And here's what he said, that the Vox reporter said, you were really good about talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4667.7s	4667.7	 about ethics for someone who kind of saw it all as a game with winners and losers. What did SPF said?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4672.9s	4672.9	 Yeah. He, he, I had to be. It's what reputations are made of to some extent. I feel bad for those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4680.0s	4680.0	 who get fucked by it. Basically all these people who incurred a quarter million dollars in debt and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4683.6s	4683.6	 think they can just spouse the right platitudes. He says, by this dumb game we woke Westerners play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4690.4s	4690.4	 where we say all the right should bless so everyone likes us. How stupid does the New York Times feel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4697.0s	4697.0	 right now? How stupid do all these nonprofits and foundations who received all this money from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4703.2s	4703.2	 SPF, he played them. All he had to do was say the right words that say the magic woke words
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4711.2s	4711.2	 and they would basically cover for the most enormous grift that's ever been perpetrated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4716.6s	4716.6	 That is basically the quid pro quo of our civilization is be woke and you will have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4721.7s	4721.7	 indefinite career opportunities. No matter how, how unmarketable. I mean, virtue signaling would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4726.6s	4726.6	 another way to say it. I mean, it doesn't necessarily have to be the work woke ideology,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4729.7s	4729.7	 but virtue signal and give donations to people. This has been a playbook of grifters for a long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4734.4s	4734.4	 time. Bernie Madoff gave a ton of donations and he used the same playbook. How many donations did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4740.5s	4740.5	 he give to the Republican party? None. They're not part of the regime. How many conservative?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4745.7s	4745.7	 Yeah, I'm not sure this is a political point. I'm not making a political point. I'm making
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4750.7s	4750.7	 a cultural point. Okay, go ahead. Who were the charities that he donated to? It was all the right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4755.9s	4755.9	 causes. Well, the pandemic one was not woke. He was passionate about the pandemic stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4761.6s	4761.6	 Are you kidding me? Freaking out about the pandemic? No, no, he wanted to do pandemic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4765.6s	4765.6	 preventions as he explained it to me. The neurosis. No, no, no, that was not what he was funding,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4770.8s	4770.8	 Sax. I actually talked to him about this when I interviewed him. He said he wanted to do pandemic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4775.7s	4775.7	 prevention and early warning systems and wanted to invest in strategies to fight the next pandemic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4781.4s	4781.4	 Definitely freaking out about COVID was the central neurosis of the professional managerial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4787.0s	4787.0	 class for the last couple of years. No, but that's not what he was funding. I just want to make that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4790.4s	4790.4	 point. Yeah. Whatever. He wanted to do prevention. I mean, you could frame it as not, but I actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4794.9s	4794.9	 literally talked to him about it. He wanted to do pandemic prevention in the future. He wanted to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4798.1s	4798.1	 steal money. No, no, no, no, no. He wanted to steal money from California taxpayers via ballot initiative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4803.8s	4803.8	 to fund his brother's organization, which would have dispersed the money in who knows what ways,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4810.6s	4810.6	 probably not legitimate out of a professed concern about the next pandemic. Why? Because the PMC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4818.3s	4818.3	 is neurotic about the last pandemic. Come on. This is all part of-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4820.8s	4820.8	 Oh, you're saying he's pandering to them. I understand what you're pointing at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4822.6s	4822.6	 Of course it's- Yes, thank you. It's pandering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4824.4s	4824.4	 Okay. I understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4824.8s	4824.8	 It's absolutely pandering. Now listen, why, well, hold on a second. Why did this work? Why did this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4828.8s	4828.8	 work? Virtue signaling work? And again, why were they only charities and causes that appeal to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4835.4s	4835.4	 the left? It's because they're the ones with the power in our society and in our culture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4840.0s	4840.0	 to define what virtue is. When you're virtue signaling, who are you signaling to? The people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4846.7s	4846.7	 with the power to decide what is virtue and what is vice. That is why people go to work at the New
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4851.7s	4851.7	 York Times. That is why they basically go into all these influential jobs at nonprofits and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4857.3s	4857.3	 foundations. They're the ones deciding what virtue is. They're the dupes. They're the ones who are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4861.2s	4861.2	 fooled. Now what's happening is there's an economic consequence to it, which is it is coming out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4866.7s	4866.7	 these people have no marketable skills and companies are tightening their belts. Now all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4871.1s	4871.1	 of a sudden, they're starting to become deeply insecure about their own future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4874.0s	4874.0	 My comment is that when you look at Twitter as an example, Bill Gurley had a really powerful quote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4880.0s	4880.0	 as well, which is when companies cut, they don't cut nearly enough and they misestimate and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4885.2s	4885.2	 underestimate how resilient a company is. Back in, Twitter had 200 million MAU. They had only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4891.2s	4891.2	 a thousand employees. And so clearly at that point, they knew what they were doing. And now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4896.0s	4896.0	 the business has increased in MAU by call it 50% to 300 million, but the employee base increased
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4904.8s	4904.8	 by seven and a half X. So clearly something is misaligned. And I think the thing that people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4911.5s	4911.5	 are going to find out is- By the way, with contractors, probably 12 X.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4915.2s	4915.2	 Right. So I think that, well, there you go. So I think that the thing that frustrates a lot of folks

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4927.3s	4927.3	 Because I think to David's point, if Elon is successful, he has uncovered this very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4933.4s	4933.4	 uncomfortable truth that was frankly hiding in plain sight, which is that many of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4938.9s	4938.9	 technology companies using technology get so much operational leverage that they have some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4945.2s	4945.2	 enormous efficiencies. And then it's only a decision by the professional managerial class
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4951.2s	4951.2	 to reward themselves with fiefdoms and kingdoms of employees and the serfs that work for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4958.1s	4958.1	 I mean, it's really quite crazy if you think about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4961.3s	4961.3	 Well, Freeberg made this early on in the history of this podcast. Freeberg said something that-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4966.0s	4966.0	 Can I just- Well, hold on. I want to add to your position. Freeberg said something that adds to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4970.1s	4970.1	 your position, which is early in this podcast, he said, the nature of organizations is they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4974.5s	4974.5	 to grow. And that's government or even these departments you're talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4977.9s	4977.9	 Anybody who runs a department is never going to say, my department needs to be 20% less so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4981.7s	4981.7	 we can hit the bottom line. They're going to say, give me 20% more because everybody else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4984.4s	4984.4	 is getting 20%. Go ahead, Chimam. Continue. And then if you layer in the Charlie Munger quote,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4989.8s	4989.8	 show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome, you can understand why because the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=4994.6s	4994.6	 professional managerial class is rewarded by compensation that is actually independent of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5002.0s	5002.0	 dilution. Because if you look at these compensation plans, all of these professional stock owners,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5007.6s	5007.6	 they complain all the time about stock-based comp. And these companies have budgets between 2% and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5012.8s	5012.8	 5% a year that they give away. And so you have this situation where an engineer or an engineering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5019.8s	5019.8	 manager or a sales manager or a marketing manager in success at a thousand people can grow to 5,000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5026.8s	5026.8	 or 10,000, their compensation doesn't change. In any other organization, their compensation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5031.6s	5031.6	 would change because let's say that it's a percentage of the profits that are distributed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5035.4s	5035.4	 Unless the company is phenomenally growing, eventually you'll see it in the bottom line of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5039.9s	5039.9	 what you take home. And so these folks are incentivized to have these status signals of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5046.3s	5046.3	 value. I have a 50, you know, you guys have heard this. I have 50-person team, I have a 100-person team,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5052.0s	5052.0	 I oversee 3,500 employees and everybody is conditioned to think, oh my God, that's incredible,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5058.2s	5058.2	 you must be really important. And so we're going to sort of now see in real time a questioning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5065.0s	5065.0	 of that belief system. And if Elon proves to be right, it's a really important decision point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5070.5s	5070.5	 for a lot of other technology companies. Because if you are an 80 to 90% gross margin business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5076.2s	5076.2	 built on software, maybe you have a bigger responsibility than you've discovered to date
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5082.4s	5082.4	 to your shareholders and to the existing employees to find the efficient rate of return, right? What
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5087.8s	5087.8	 is the efficient frontier of headcount? The other thing is, it now allows, let's just say that now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5094.1s	5094.1	 Twitter goes to, I'm making up a number, 2000 employees after this whole Google form thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5100.7s	5100.7	 The great thing about the 2001st employee for the 2000 employees and for the shareholders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5108.0s	5108.0	 is that that 2001st new employee is 100% aligned because they're coming into something eyes wide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5112.8s	5112.8	 open. And I think that that's also an interesting thing that isn't getting enough recognition is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5118.4s	5118.4	 he's putting out there what he stands for, this hardcore culture, irrespective of whether we think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5124.4s	5124.4	 it's right or wrong, all the people that stay are voting that it's right. And you know, as long as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5129.5s	5129.5	 it's not breaking any laws, he's allowed to do that. And so if people now want to join that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5134.1s	5134.1	 organization, they should be allowed to do that too, just like the people who don't want to should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5137.7s	5137.7	 be allowed to leave. Sacks, you and I came up and we talked about this, I think on last week's show,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5142.1s	5142.1	 or maybe it was two weeks ago, we talked about what the expectation was in Silicon Valley at a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5146.4s	5146.4	 startup, what startup culture was in terms of just the effort that was required to build a winning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5151.6s	5151.6	 company. And we all said 60 hours a week was the baseline. That's something that, you know, has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5156.8s	5156.8	 been I think a lot of people you mentioned this Chamath people working two jobs for 30 hours a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5162.0s	5162.0	 week and taking two salaries from two of the fan companies. And if you remember that 10 episodes ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5166.1s	5166.1	 Jake, go into TikTok and search for, you know, engineering salaries, you'll see some of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5170.6s	5170.6	 craziest tic tocs kids are making 350k working 30 hours a week. It's nuts. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5177.0s	5177.0	 And so I think we're going to have is a I think we're gonna have a cultural divide here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5180.0s	5180.0	 there are going to be a series of companies that say this is classic Silicon Valley, we're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5183.8s	5183.8	 we're going to crush it, we're going to work aggressively, we're going to put in 5060 70 hours
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5187.6s	5187.6	 a week, and we're all going to benefit from that. And then there'll be another class of companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5190.8s	5190.8	 that says, Hey, no, we want to have a more lifestyle business. And if people want to work 3040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5195.7s	5195.7	 hours a week, and they contribute, we don't need to be perfectly efficient. And you know what,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5199.7s	5199.7	 the playing field of entrepreneurship, the playing field of capitalism will show who is right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5204.7s	5204.7	 sex. Yeah, I mean, look, I actually went out town a few days ago. So I wasn't keeping up with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5209.7s	5209.7	 you know, every detail of what was happening at Twitter. And I started getting all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5213.6s	5213.6	 text messages about how Twitter was dead or dying or whatever, like the site had been unplugged,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5217.6s	5217.6	 or what have you. And I'm like, what is going on? And you know, you tweeted this morning,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5222.0s	5222.0	 Hey, is this working? And I'm like, Yeah, like, like, yes, it's working. Like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5226.0s	5226.0	 and this morning, is this working? And so what my tweet went through? Yeah, so I came to learn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5232.4s	5232.4	 what they're talking about is that all Elon did was give a voluntary offer that if you didn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5237.6s	5237.6	 want to stay, you could take three months severance. Now, remember, last week, they had a riff,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5242.9s	5242.9	 you know, which was basically economically required, in which they gave employees three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5247.2s	5247.2	 months severance, which is 50% more than what he had to it was generous. Now, it seems to me that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5253.6s	5253.6	 what if you're one of the employees in the other half that made the cut, but yet you're not really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5258.3s	5258.3	 motivated to stay. And maybe you don't really want to operate like a startup. I mean, Elon's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5264.7s	5264.7	 basically saying we're going to go back to working and operating like a startup. That means that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5269.4s	5269.4	 might have to work nights and weekends like a startup. What if that's not what you signed up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5273.6s	5273.6	 for? You may be sitting there at Twitter saying, Oh, man, I wish I got in rift. Well, now, Elon is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5279.2s	5279.2	 offering you the opportunity to take the same package. So I'm like, how can this possibly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5285.6s	5285.6	 be a bad thing? It's actually the great management technique that Tony Shay rest in peace from Zappos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5290.8s	5290.8	 created. He would say when people went through their first couple of months of training, he'd
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5294.6s	5294.6	 say, Now, if you don't want this job, I will pay you a month salary. This is on their first day after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5300.6s	5300.6	 they went through training, their first like day on the job, he said, Okay, now that you've gone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5304.3s	5304.3	 through the training, I'll pay you I think it was $5,000 or $3,000 to not take the job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5309.2s	5309.2	 And something like one out of five people would do it. And so he said, Listen, I don't have to fire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5313.7s	5313.7	 them later on, this is going to make my management easier. It was it's it is actually a kind thing to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5318.4s	5318.4	 do to give people the opportunity to leave giving employees an option to opt out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5323.9s	5323.9	 You know why this is because the reason people are upset, let's be honest, sex is some people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5331.5s	5331.5	 you know, live to work and some people work to live and the people who are working to live,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5336.8s	5336.8	 find it crazy that hustle culture even exists and people who are part of hustle culture,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5341.2s	5341.2	 like the four people this podcast, find it's just working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5345.4s	5345.4	 Hustle culture is working above the hours you're being paid for. That's that's basically what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5349.2s	5349.2	 hustle culture that's how most people would define it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5354.1s	5354.1	 It's actually not you work for 40 hours, a salary means you get your job done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5358.5s	5358.5	 Okay, that's how we look at it. That is not how other people look at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5362.0s	5362.0	 And you have to Oh, my god,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5364.2s	5364.2	 there's no question that Elon is going to raise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5367.4s	5367.4	 If we lose American primacy, it's because of that, not because of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5370.8s	5370.8	 I agree with you. I'm just give the other side. I'm still made on the other side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5374.6s	5374.6	 People look at their salary. And they look at themselves as getting compensated for 40 hours
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5379.2s	5379.2	 and every hour above that. But do you know how this generation's mind looks as hustle culture,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5384.1s	5384.1	 there are people that are working there are people that are working 607080 hours a week as a teacher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5389.5s	5389.5	 to make 3040k firefighters, you know, working on oil rigs and to hear somebody like hustle culture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5396.4s	5396.4	 at a startup where you're making 350 grand and you're upset because like the matcha that ran out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5400.9s	5400.9	 or whatever. It's just so out of touch. I'm not disagreeing. Yeah, look, my view on it is that

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5412.0s	5412.0	 way to be successful is to work hard. But the only way to work hard and be happy is to really

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5426.3s	5426.3	 generous for Elon to be offering them a package. It's the right thing to do. I don't understand how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5431.6s	5431.6	 giving them an option was anything but positive and yet the media has gone berserk on it. Meanwhile,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5465.9s	5465.9	 is because they were complicit in his reputation laundering. Yes. The New York Times, before that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5471.1s	5471.1	 article, put out this other puff piece where they talked to him and they were excoriated on Twitter

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5507.1s	5507.1	 I mean, let's be intellectually honest here. I love that meme that Elon tweeted out. Do you see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5511.1s	5511.1	 that? The two rhinos hunting. No, no, please don't. It cracked me up so much.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5572.1s	5572.1	 photographer is pointing in completely the wrong direction. Wrong direction. He's just totally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5575.6s	5575.6	 missing it. You cannot see the thing that is obviously right in front of his face. Right. That he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5580.5s	5580.5	 should be photographing. Yes. He's using that long telephoto lens. And that is that is the New York

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5600.8s	5600.8	 tweets in a story. Well, I'm going to pluck. You're right. It's a tweet story. But it's a really good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5604.4s	5604.4	 one. Of course it's a tweet story. It's biology. He says, think of a regulator as a binary classifier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5608.8s	5608.8	 What's their false positive and false negative rate? Bitcoin ETF blocked for years. FTX ignored

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5631.4s	5631.4	 It is a banger. It's not consumer protection. It's re-election. Listen, if you are part of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5636.3s	5636.3	 these interlocking power structures that we call the regime, it's the New York Times,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5655.6s	5655.6	 But starting in January, there's any amount of congressional oversight. How's your Hunter

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5669.7s	5669.7	 Representatives needs to be SBF and FTX, not Hunter Biden. SBF makes Hunter Biden look like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5675.0s	5675.0	 piker. Hunter Biden was what? A couple million dollars of grift. This is $10 billion plus a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5681.6s	5681.6	 grift. It also touches regulators. It could touch, it's a big deal. It's a systemic failure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5688.0s	5688.0	 Hunter Biden knows how to party. So let's be honest here. I mean, that is the issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5691.9s	5691.9	 I just think the quote of the week goes to John J. Wray. He's FTX's new CEO. He famously oversaw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5700.4s	5700.4	 the liquidation of Enron. And he says, I have over 40 years of legal and restructuring experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5706.6s	5706.6	 I have been the chief restructuring officer and or chief executive officer in several of the largest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5711.7s	5711.7	 corporate failures in history. I have supervised situations involving allegations of criminal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5715.6s	5715.6	 activity and malfeasance, Enron. Nearly every situation in which I have been involved has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5720.4s	5720.4	 been characterized by deficits of some sort in internal controls, regulatory, implied human
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5724.5s	5724.5	 resources and system integrity. Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5730.6s	5730.6	 corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5736.2s	5736.2	 This is the person who oversaw Enron saying this is unprecedented. Enron was the previous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5743.6s	5743.6	 unprecedented situation, which is now being framed as manageable by none other than John J. Wray.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5751.7s	5751.7	 What a great name. Congratulations on being the chief restructuring officer of FTX.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5756.4s	5756.4	 There was an article that showed, Nick, if you could please throw the picture up on the screen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5761.5s	5761.5	 of all the people that invested the universe of SBF. And the article headline was, it's a who's who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5772.3s	5772.3	 of VC. And my comment is actually, no, this list is a who's who of people who did no diligence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5779.8s	5779.8	 whatsoever. And I just want to call one person, Nick, if you look at the Alameda Research,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5785.5s	5785.5	 this firm called Oneinch, J. Cal invested in a firm named after the length of his penis.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5798.9s	5798.9	 there's shrinkage. Listen, I'm a shower. I'm a grower, not a shower. All right. Listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5807.4s	5807.4	 you guys coming out, everybody knows coming out of the cold plunge, it's not going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5813.1s	5813.1	 the best performance for any of us. What is that? We've lost the script on the show. Jesus,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5821.4s	5821.4	 please. We got to wrap. I mean, it's just too much. Do you guys not think that all these investors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5825.9s	5825.9	 receive audited financials and they had a lawyer, a legal firm that represented these financials?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5832.2s	5832.2	 Did you guys see who FTX's auditing firm was? It's called Prager Metis. And it says it's based
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5837.4s	5837.4	 in the metaverse. This is like the Hollywood upstairs medical college of the auditing world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5842.3s	5842.3	 Their address is in Decentraland. Bernie Madoff, I think his brother-in-law ran the accounting firm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5847.3s	5847.3	 that did their audits. It was like, and it was on a dead floor in the lipstick building. It was in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5851.4s	5851.4	 the same building. Right. On the lipstick building, they have like a secret floor with nobody on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5856.4s	5856.4	 Even in that case, people relied on an audit from a CPA that said, here are the numbers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5860.8s	5860.8	 And those numbers were fraudulently conveyed. And I think that there's probably some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5866.3s	5866.3	 forgiveness necessary here that there was fraud. There may have been serious fraud that took place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5871.0s	5871.0	 I don't want to be too disparaging of all the people that we know that work at these investment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5875.2s	5875.2	 firms, made an investment and they all got duped and the LPs got duped. And so I don't think this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5879.8s	5879.8	 is just fundamentally like a failure of diligence. We were part of the process where they tried to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5885.2s	5885.2	 show. I have to be careful. My lawyers remind me that we're still under NDA actually with FDXO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5889.9s	5889.9	 But what I can tell you is we did not get any financials. So we were verbally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5893.6s	5893.6	 described what was going on. And they told you to have off. Right. When you asked for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5895.9s	5895.9	 When you double clicked on diligence. We sent a two-pager of stuff. Anyways,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5899.5s	5899.5	 I can't say more than that. Yeah. Don't get yourself in trouble. Oh, I want to say something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5903.1s	5903.1	 else, by the way. Last Friday, David and I were at Yuri Milner's birthday party and there was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5909.7s	5909.7	 chess tournament and Magnus Carlsen was there. And anyways, David was in the finals. Okay. It was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5917.0s	5917.0	 David and his partner. Look at the smile on David's face. Hold on. Wait, I'm getting to a great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5921.6s	5921.6	 punchline versus Magnus Carlsen and his partner. David won. Wow. Amazing. My partner was, should I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5930.0s	5930.0	 say Yuri's daughter, who I think is probably what? Like 10 years old. Oh, she's incredible. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5933.6s	5933.6	 She's like second in America. Yeah. She's good. She's incredible. Anyway. Yeah. Thank you to Yuri.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5937.9s	5937.9	 That was a really unique partner chess. My partner was a prognomanda who's an Indian grandmaster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5944.0s	5944.0	 Who's like a superstar. Yeah. And look, playing, you know, with Magnus Carlsen was obviously,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5949.2s	5949.2	 that was a real thrill. Yeah. There you go. So when you rank this with the birth of your children,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5955.0s	5955.0	 your marriage, and this, where would that rank on the scale of one through five? This is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5962.0s	5962.0	 for your pork kids. But you know what? Speaking of the pod. Look at the smile. Zach is happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5966.5s	5966.5	 Oh my God. I haven't seen him that happy since Trump won. Look at that document I just sent you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5972.1s	5972.1	 That's how we lost. We gotta wrap this thing. But I want to show you this. Basically, I pulled all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5976.7s	5976.7	 IPO since 2020. So this excludes all SPAC mergers and real estate, finance, material, energy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5982.2s	5982.2	 utility. So kind of the big bulky private equity type stuff. So it's mostly tech, consumer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5987.1s	5987.1	 627 IPO since 2020. More than half of them, or basically half of them, are trading at less,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=5995.7s	5995.7	 at 0.2 times the total cash they've burnt. So there, you know, you can kind of look at total
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6001.4s	6001.4	 lifetime capital burned by these companies in the retained earnings line on the balance sheet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6005.9s	6005.9	 And so when you pull out the retained earnings, it shows you right how much money they've burnt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6009.2s	6009.2	 over their lifetime. And so the total money burnt by half of these companies is about $107 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6016.4s	6016.4	 And the market cap of those companies is only $26 billion in aggregate. So a 0.2 times return
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6022.8s	6022.8	 on capital invested to date in terms of enterprise value divided by total capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6029.2s	6029.2	 invested in parts to date. Let me say it in English and you tell me if I said it right. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6033.5s	6033.5	 627 non-SPAC, non-real estate, non-finance companies went public. So basically 627
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6042.0s	6042.0	 tech companies went public since 2020. So two years. Yep. And of those 627 tech companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6049.9s	6049.9	 almost half or 300 of them, 48% of them are today worth about 0.2 times all the money that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6059.6s	6059.6	 went into them. Yep. My gosh. Wow. Yep. It's tough. And then on the other half, the other half is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6067.7s	6067.7	 the ones that have worked. So this kind of goes back to a power law point. But like as a venture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6072.4s	6072.4	 industry, you think once you get a company public, it's successful. And the reality is that many of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6078.1s	6078.1	 these companies from an economic perspective are still not successful. It looks like half and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6085.6s	6085.6	 perhaps much more if you include all the SPAC mergers, which is another couple hundred. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6091.1s	6091.1	 would guess the vast majority of those meet this criteria are trading at less than the total cash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6096.4s	6096.4	 that's been invested in them. Freeburg, this speaks to the age of excess that we just went through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6101.6s	6101.6	 We just weren't as efficient as we needed to be in running these companies. And now we're in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6105.6s	6105.6	 age of efficiency, austerity, excellence. But it also comes to this great setup for a rebound,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6110.8s	6110.8	 isn't it? Freeburg? Like I don't know. But look, I mean, one way to read this, I was speaking with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6115.0s	6115.0	 someone who I you can bleep him out. I was talking with two weeks ago, three weeks ago, and he showed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6120.4s	6120.4	 me in their how much should I say here? This is a big investment firm, and they have a big growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6126.0s	6126.0	 portfolio, less than they have about 160 investments, 180 investments in their growth portfolio. 85%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6135.6s	6135.6	 of the returns are generated by 10 companies of the 180. And that's in the growth portfolio. These
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6142.0s	6142.0	 are supposedly de-risk businesses. The power exists even in the power exists in growth. And as you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6147.4s	6147.4	 see here, the power law exists quite dramatically post IPO as well. So you know, as you can see here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6154.8s	6154.8	 only 9% of these businesses have generated positive earnings over time. 43%, about half of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6161.9s	6161.9	 are worth more than the total cash that's been invested in them. And that multiple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6167.2s	6167.2	 This is a production board study here, by the way. This is your done by your family.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6171.2s	6171.2	 Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's off public data. So the the multiple on the value of the companies that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6178.8s	6178.8	 are worth more than their the cash invested is 5.5 times. So in aggregate, IPO since 2020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6184.6s	6184.6	 are worth 4.3 times the total cash that's been invested in them over their lifetime. But the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6190.8s	6190.8	 crazy statistic is half of them are worth significantly less than the cash that's been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6194.0s	6194.0	 invested in them only point two times. So the power law dominates both early growth and clearly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6200.8s	6200.8	 being public. But I think to your point, Jake, how it also seriously speaks to the amount of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6206.1s	6206.1	 excess and it's really going to rationalize probably based on the conversations we had today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6209.4s	6209.4	 about Twitter, Meta, Google, Amazon, Amazon, and this as well. So certainly, also the good new series
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6217.3s	6217.3	 Freeberg and correct me if I'm wrong here, Chamath, we want more companies to go public and have that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6221.9s	6221.9	 discipline of being a public company. This was the big critique of this quiet era of companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6226.9s	6226.9	 taking 1012 14 years to go public. This is going to be a strength for these entrepreneurs to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6232.7s	6232.7	 to fight it out in the public market under scrutiny. Correct, Chamath? 100% I think like the Chris
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6237.6s	6237.6	 Holm letter. I think that there are a lot of VCs on boards of companies who would love to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6243.1s	6243.1	 say the equivalent thing to their private company. And part of the dynamics as Freeberg just said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6250.7s	6250.7	 because it's such a power law and people believe that you being with other VCs are really important,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6256.0s	6256.0	 it turns out that most of these VCs abandoned their role on these boards and don't really hold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6259.8s	6259.8	 people accountable because they're worried it'll affect their deal flow. And so the problem is it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6264.1s	6264.1	 a negative reflexive loop. So these companies do poorly and then as a result, they're viewed as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6268.9s	6268.9	 not an effective board member. And so the next deal they get is a poor and poor quality. So the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6273.1s	6273.1	 highly correlated portfolios in Silicon Valley are the ones that will get torched because most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6278.4s	6278.4	 of those companies will receive very poor or no advice. And then the few that will get to the end
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6285.1s	6285.1	 is because they have hard nosed people on the board that will force them to make really hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6290.8s	6290.8	 decisions. Yeah, that's it. Sax, any thoughts here on the public markets? Oh, sorry, wait, last thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6296.8s	6296.8	 And by the way, Sequoia, who has had exceptional returns has always been known to be hard nosed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6301.3s	6301.3	 You know, a lot of people that critique against Sequoia from founders would be that, oh, if I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6305.7s	6305.7	 take Sequoia's money, they may fire me. Well, yeah, because if you're not good, it's the mission of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6311.2s	6311.2	 the business is bigger than your ability to be the CEO. And so, you know, you just have to remember,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6316.5s	6316.5	 like, there is no free lunch. We were not giving out free money here. The pendulum swung one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6322.1s	6322.1	 direction too far. The tradition in Silicon Valley used to be you always replace the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6326.5s	6326.5	 CEOs, the founders with a professional CEO, and Google being the turning point there or maybe the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6332.0s	6332.0	 last one. And then it became founders will control their companies with super voting shares forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6336.9s	6336.9	 Hopefully, the pendulum now swings to some equilibrium. Sax, what are you seeing in private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6340.7s	6340.7	 markets? The JAWS program for surplus elites is going away. The JAWS program? That's the TLDR.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6348.2s	6348.2	 The JAWS program for surplus elites is going away. Professional managerial class is under pressure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6353.2s	6353.2	 Yes. That's for sure. If you went woke, you may go broke because you have no marketable skills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6359.5s	6359.5	 Man, you're a bunch of guys out there. Is Dean giving you these one-liners?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6369.6s	6369.6	 Who? Jackie the Jokeman? Jackie the Jokeman? Marlin handing you little notes there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6374.2s	6374.2	 All right. Four, the Sultan of Science, David Friedberg, and also the executive producer

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6397.3s	6397.3	 road trip for the dictator in J-Cal. It's going to be fun. I am the world's greatest moderator who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6403.6s	6403.6	 couldn't control the panel today. I'll do better next week and we'll see you next time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6407.2s	6407.2	 Love you guys. Happy Thanksgiving.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6442.8s	6442.8	 We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just useless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX7tj3giizI&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=17&t=6446.7s	6446.7	 It's like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.
