https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=55.5s	55.5	 Hey everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=56.3s	56.3	 Welcome to episode 55 of the all in podcast with us again this week, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=61.1s	61.1	 dictator himself, Chamath Pali, the queen of Kenwa David Friedberg and coming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=69.0s	69.0	 back from Portugal and the Solana conference riding his where heroin and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=75.0s	75.0	 prostitution are legal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=76.8s	76.8	 Well, we were gonna we were gonna double click on that, but you jumped
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=79.7s	79.7	 the gun here on the docket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=80.9s	80.9	 So David, how was the heroin in Portugal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=83.9s	83.9	 Great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=85.1s	85.1	 Okay, I was I was fully drinking the Kool-Aid at the slana conference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=90.3s	90.3	 It wasn't heroin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=91.1s	91.1	 It was Kool-Aid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=91.9s	91.9	 It was literally Kool-Aid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=95.7s	95.7	 How many people were at the Solana conference in Portugal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=98.9s	98.9	 Why is it in Portugal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=100.4s	100.4	 What happens at a Solana crypto conference?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=104.8s	104.8	 I think there were thousands of people there and it was, I mean, easily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=108.6s	108.6	 And I mean, it was kind of a madhouse and people were trying to get in last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=112.6s	112.6	 minute and nobody could get in because the conference was like totally sold out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=115.9s	115.9	 It was a lot of crypto developers, a lot of people with projects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=120.3s	120.3	 And why Portugal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=121.8s	121.8	 I think because there's a lot of conferences happening in Portugal right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=125.4s	125.4	 now because they are easier on the COVID restrictions and a lot of other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=129.1s	129.1	 countries, so you can actually get in there and host a conference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=133.6s	133.6	 What was it indoors with no masks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=137.1s	137.1	 For mass optional?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=139.1s	139.1	 I can't remember if like masks were required or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=142.7s	142.7	 I did see people wearing masks indoors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=144.9s	144.9	 Were you required to be vaccinated?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=146.6s	146.6	 Did they do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=147.8s	147.8	 I think I did show a vaccine pass that when I checked in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=151.1s	151.1	 I just did my booster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=153.3s	153.3	 I'm going to do my booster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=154.4s	154.4	 It kind of, it kind of, it was a little, I would say the same kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=159.3s	159.3	 shitty feeling as the second one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=163.1s	163.1	 I just got fired.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=163.9s	163.9	 I mean, I had the first two were Pfizer, so I took Pfizer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=166.4s	166.4	 She was the nurse actually gave me a choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=168.9s	168.9	 She's like, you can do whatever you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=170.1s	170.1	 Pfizer, Moderna or J and J.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=171.3s	171.3	 I just, I didn't know any better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=172.8s	172.8	 I texted my doctor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=175.1s	175.1	 So I just took Pfizer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=177.2s	177.2	 Although the interesting thing is Moderna is the only one that's dose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=180.0s	180.0	 regulated for the third dose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=181.3s	181.3	 So there's a, they, they, they actually give you less specifically, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=185.1s	185.1	 Pfizer is the same for all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=186.2s	186.2	 I think we talked about this on the pod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=187.6s	187.6	 There's one theory, which they told you get whatever one you can get was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=191.7s	191.7	 instructions because it's more important to just get one than which one you get.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=195.6s	195.6	 But they said there's a Swiss cheese theory, which is if you took two slices
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=198.8s	198.8	 of Swiss cheese from two different bricks of it, the holes would not be the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=202.3s	202.3	 And therefore you overlap them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=203.7s	203.7	 So whichever deficiencies each one had, maybe the other one doesn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=207.1s	207.1	 So I should have gotten Moderna is what you're saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=208.7s	208.7	 That would be, I, if you believe in the Swiss cheese there, I don't know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=211.3s	211.3	 Freiburg, you're a science guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=212.4s	212.4	 I should ask Aaron Rogers what he thinks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=215.9s	215.9	 I mean, he just straight up lied about being vaccinated, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=218.9s	218.9	 I think so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=219.9s	219.9	 And I think the NFL is not doing anything about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=222.9s	222.9	 That's not cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=224.4s	224.4	 Why would you lie about it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=225.5s	225.5	 I mean, he's not, he would have still been allowed to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=228.5s	228.5	 So there was no reason to lie about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=229.9s	229.9	 I, I'm not totally up on that story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=233.4s	233.4	 The rumor is that Kyrie is going to be playing basketball soon because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=237.1s	237.1	 New York Adams is going to lift the vaccine restrictions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=240.9s	240.9	 You will not need to be show a vaccine card or wear a mask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=245.6s	245.6	 Bro, I don't think PCR test every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=248.6s	248.6	 I don't think it's going to matter because the warriors are shooting the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=251.4s	251.4	 lights out and clay hasn't even come back yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=253.7s	253.7	 And so that Gary Payton, the second you see Gary's, did you see Gary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=258.4s	258.4	 Payton, yeah, junior, uh, that clips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=261.9s	261.9	 I mean, I mean, he's like living above the rim and his Wiseman back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=267.4s	267.4	 And then, uh, Wiggins is playing great basketball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=270.2s	270.2	 I mean, the warriors are going to win this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=271.8s	271.8	 I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=272.3s	272.3	 Steph is other worldly right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=275.1s	275.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=275.5s	275.5	 I think Steph's got something to prove, um, even though he doesn't, but he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=279.1s	279.1	 playing like he's got something to prove.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=280.2s	280.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=280.5s	280.5	 So, um, do we want to just cover, um, the elephant in the room there, the last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=286.9s	286.9	 episode, I think we should just get out of the way because it relates to Solana.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=289.5s	289.5	 There was, we took something out of the last podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=292.9s	292.9	 So people understand we have an agreement between the four of us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=296.0s	296.0	 If there's something that somebody, uh, doesn't want in the pod after we record
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=300.4s	300.4	 it, we'll take it out because we don't want anybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=302.9s	302.9	 I mean, I think the philosophy, we haven't said this out loud is we don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=307.1s	307.1	 want anybody to say something they regret that could cause damage to other people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=311.6s	311.6	 or to themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=312.3s	312.3	 So if they want to take something out that they said, that's fine with all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=316.5s	316.5	 us and, um, basically each of us has veto right on something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=319.8s	319.8	 So last week, two people took their veto right on something and we took something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=323.1s	323.1	 out, you want to explain our thinking on that Sax and why we're reversing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=327.2s	327.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=327.6s	327.6	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=327.9s	327.9	 So a few weeks ago on the pod, there was an oblique reference between me and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=332.8s	332.8	 Chamath regarding Solana.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=335.1s	335.1	 And so, and so some internet theorists that claim that we were trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=339.8s	339.8	 engineer a pump and dump in Solana, which if you actually listen to what we said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=344.6s	344.6	 um, it certainly is not a pump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=346.6s	346.6	 Um, let me explain what it was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=348.7s	348.7	 So.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=350.3s	350.3	 Craft is the beneficiary because we invest, we're the first investors in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=353.7s	353.7	 multi-coin, we were kind of like their seed investor, investor in there who put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=357.1s	357.1	 in something like 40% of the money for their special opportunity fund.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=361.1s	361.1	 They were one of the first investors in Solana.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=363.3s	363.3	 So we are the beneficiary of about a billion dollars of Solana.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=366.7s	366.7	 So thank you, multi-coin at some point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=370.6s	370.6	 Well, so, so they have started doing distributions, but at the time I texted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=374.9s	374.9	 Chamath, they hadn't really started doing distributions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=377.5s	377.5	 I didn't know how deep and liquid the market for Solana was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=381.3s	381.3	 I just asked Chamath, like I had heard Chamath may have said something that he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=385.2s	385.2	 was long Solana and wanted to accumulate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=387.4s	387.4	 So I sent him a text saying, Hey, are you interested?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=390.9s	390.9	 You know, I thought maybe we could do an OTC transaction at some point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=393.7s	393.7	 when we get our Solana.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=395.3s	395.3	 He basically, you know, we had a brief exchange about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=398.5s	398.5	 And then he mentioned on the pot, that was the extent of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=400.8s	400.8	 What I didn't know at the time, but learned subsequently is that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=403.6s	403.6	 market for Solana is very deep, about three and a half billion notional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=407.4s	407.4	 is traded every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=409.1s	409.1	 So there's no need, even if we want it to fully get out of our Solana position,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=413.4s	413.4	 which by the way, we don't even have, you know, multi-coin still has most of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=417.9s	417.9	 We, it's not necessary to do an OTC transaction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=420.7s	420.7	 We could just sell it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=421.7s	421.7	 Explain what OTC transaction is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=423.0s	423.0	 Oh, it just means over the counter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=424.3s	424.3	 It just means that instead of going to like an exchange, you would deal with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=427.9s	427.9	 like a trading desk or it could just be direct, like for me to Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=432.3s	432.3	 So that was basically the exchange.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=434.6s	434.6	 It, Chamath and I talked about it for maybe two minutes, and then it came
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=438.0s	438.0	 up on the pod for 20 seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=440.0s	440.0	 So then some internet theorists basically clipped it and try to accuse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=444.1s	444.1	 us of organizing a pump and dump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=446.1s	446.1	 Well, obviously if you're talking about selling something, it's not a pump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=449.6s	449.6	 It's also not a dump either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=451.4s	451.4	 So anyway, the reason why we said cut it out last week is because we didn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=456.3s	456.3	 want to give oxygen to this stupid, like conspiracy theory that somebody had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=461.0s	461.0	 invented on the internet with like no basis whatsoever, because you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=466.0s	466.0	 spend all day trying to like shoot this stuff down, but then at the Solana
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=470.1s	470.1	 conference, enough told me enough people told me that this was becoming a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=473.8s	473.8	 meme that I thought was worth addressing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=475.7s	475.7	 And what, and look, you have to understand with crypto is that for every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=479.4s	479.4	 cryptocurrency like Solana, there are haters because they're invested in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=484.1s	484.1	 Or everybody's talking up their books, their pump and dumps, and there are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=488.4s	488.4	 armies of anonymous Twitter accounts that will coordinate attacks and or memes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=495.9s	495.9	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=496.2s	496.2	 So they're trying to spread the rumor that like VCs are big holders in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=499.5s	499.5	 Solana and are going to dump it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=501.0s	501.0	 The reality is that multi-coin has a large position, but they have LPs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=505.3s	505.3	 They are slowly distributing their positions to LPs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=509.6s	509.6	 We will then-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=510.1s	510.1	 In the forms of the tokens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=511.1s	511.1	 They're not selling them and giving you cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=512.5s	512.5	 They're giving you the tokens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=513.4s	513.4	 You get to decide what you do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=514.6s	514.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=514.9s	514.9	 And by the way, that's what we'd like to do as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=516.6s	516.6	 We're currently working through those mechanics because it's actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=519.7s	519.7	 complicated for a VC firm to distribute, you know, in kind through tokens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=524.3s	524.3	 But-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=524.9s	524.9	 If you had to give them to your LPs-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=526.7s	526.7	 That's what I would like to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=528.1s	528.1	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=528.7s	528.7	 So-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=528.8s	528.8	 People are doing that with Coinbase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=530.2s	530.2	 So Coinbase is providing that as a service now, from my understanding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=532.7s	532.7	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=533.0s	533.0	 So we have to work through with our LPs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=535.2s	535.2	 That's what we're going to try to do is distribute it in kind so everyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=538.0s	538.0	 can make their own decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=539.5s	539.5	 I have a couple of things to say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=541.5s	541.5	 So I've only been a buyer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=543.8s	543.8	 I've never, I haven't sold a single Solana token.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=550.5s	550.5	 And so we are, you know, net buyers and we're buying a bunch of stuff, but I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=556.7s	556.7	 hate acknowledging that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=557.9s	557.9	 And this is why, you know, my tone was more non-committal when we did the pod
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=564.5s	564.5	 is that I really don't like this culture that's emerged via Twitter mostly where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=573.2s	573.2	 you all of a sudden have to be this maximalist that basically falls on their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=577.5s	577.5	 sword and never sells in order to be legitimate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=580.7s	580.7	 And I think that that's a really dangerous place to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=583.0s	583.0	 So, you know, look, if I take a-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=584.7s	584.7	 Why is that dangerous?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=585.7s	585.7	 Well, if I take a much, much bigger step back, let me put Solana in the context of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=590.9s	590.9	 crypto and let me put crypto in the context of the markets and where we are today at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=595.1s	595.1	 the end of the week after, you know, Q3 earnings in November of 2021, we have the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=603.2s	603.2	 stock market at absolute all time highs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=606.5s	606.5	 Ripping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=607.2s	607.2	 We have crypto at absolute all time highs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=610.6s	610.6	 Ripping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=611.1s	611.1	 We have the art markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=612.1s	612.1	 I don't know if you guys saw Phillips and Christie's and Sotheby's this past week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=615.6s	615.6	 At absolute all time highs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=617.4s	617.4	 Sold another people for 25 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=619.5s	619.5	 We have inflation at a 30 year high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=622.5s	622.5	 We have 10 year break evens at a 25 year high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=626.8s	626.8	 We have, you know, one point somewhat trillion dollars that we just approved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=630.4s	630.4	 last weekend, we're still horse trading on another three, you know, $1.8 trillion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=634.9s	634.9	 of stimulus that we're going to put in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=637.5s	637.5	 And so when you, and then you have, and I think the most important thing, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=643.5s	643.5	 the two most important founders of our generation, the two smartest people who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=648.0s	648.0	 have really consistently won Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have collectively sold more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=652.1s	652.1	 than $11 billion of their holdings this year alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=656.1s	656.1	 And if you can't take all of that and decide for yourself, what's right for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=660.5s	660.5	 and your family, you're doing yourself a disservice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=663.3s	663.3	 I think it's important for me to never sort of like, you know, be forced to tell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=667.5s	667.5	 folks whether I'm buying or selling, although I'm willing to do it in moments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=670.6s	670.6	 where I think it's important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=673.3s	673.3	 But I think it's really important to understand the context.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=676.2s	676.2	 And so I think like these folks that like think derisively about individuals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=680.3s	680.3	 who are managing risk, I think it's really naive and I think it's, um, it creates a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=685.5s	685.5	 lot of missed opportunity for them as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=687.8s	687.8	 If the smartest people in the world are now selling their core holdings that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=693.7s	693.7	 told you they would never sell, and you are not reconsidering your position on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=699.7s	699.7	 things, you're either much smarter than them, or you're being really, really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=706.0s	706.0	 reckless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=708.9s	708.9	 All right, there you have it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=711.8s	711.8	 Yeah, no, you know, I, we just, as people also know, inside baseball, we have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=715.7s	715.7	 docket of stories that we talk about on our group chat that make up the docket
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=719.1s	719.1	 for the show, but I'll bring stuff up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=721.0s	721.0	 And I didn't bring that up in some way to cause trouble or anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=724.4s	724.4	 I thought you guys would want to clear the air about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=726.7s	726.7	 And I understand your mouth's position of, Hey, you don't want to give these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=729.8s	729.8	 things oxygen or whatever, but I think I didn't even know that we needed to clear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=733.7s	733.7	 the air until, you know, I went to the conference and enough people mentioned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=736.9s	736.9	 it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=737.0s	737.0	 So, but what's so funny is half the people on Twitter spend all their time in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=740.3s	740.3	 crypto lens saying things like never going to make it have fun staying poor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=745.0s	745.0	 They're extremely Jason, as you said, tribal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=748.0s	748.0	 I'm not sure that they're doing first principles analysis of these things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=751.3s	751.3	 They're gone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=752.0s	752.0	 They've got exceptionally lucky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=754.3s	754.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=755.0s	755.0	 Some of them are exceptionally good, but many people broadly speaking have gotten
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=758.5s	758.5	 exceptionally lucky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=759.9s	759.9	 And I think a little bit of it is getting to their head where they become, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=763.3s	763.3	 know, very virulent against people that they think, you know, whose perspectives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=767.5s	767.5	 may actually be negatively affecting their position without actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=770.4s	770.4	 understanding what David said, which is these are incredibly deep liquid markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=773.7s	773.7	 And one person's opinion is can't do much of anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=777.5s	777.5	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=777.7s	777.7	 I mean, that's a really good point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=779.7s	779.7	 I mean, I'd like to give my opinion on Solana, but the thing or just crypto in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=783.3s	783.3	 general, the thing that's like hard about it is that it's hard to talk about the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=786.5s	786.5	 benefits of say the Solana blockchain without being seen as a pumper of soul or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=791.8s	791.8	 a dumper of ether or whatever, because all these things are so intrinsically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=794.5s	794.5	 connected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=795.5s	795.5	 I mean, I learned a lot of really bullish things about Solana, you know, at this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=799.6s	799.6	 conference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=800.8s	800.8	 I mean, the biggest thing is, I mean, there's basically a battle for the hearts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=805.0s	805.0	 and minds of developers going on right now between Solana and Ethereum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=807.9s	807.9	 That's why Solana has raced up to, you know, over 200.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=812.5s	812.5	 I don't know what like 7000% increase or something incredible like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=816.7s	816.7	 The reason is because Solana as a blockchain gives confirmations back in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=820.8s	820.8	 something like 400 milliseconds, whereas Ethereum takes minutes and a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=825.5s	825.5	 transaction that might cost tens of dollars, 10, 20, 30, 50 dollars of gas on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=830.9s	830.9	 Ethereum cost pennies on Solana.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=833.7s	833.7	 And so that's the advantage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=834.8s	834.8	 Yeah, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=835.8s	835.8	 It's also, you know, a lot of developers feel like the tools, the developer tools
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=839.7s	839.7	 that they've created are easier than building on Solidity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=843.0s	843.0	 The thing that Solana gives up, the trade off that it makes is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=846.3s	846.3	 decentralization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=847.3s	847.3	 There's basically that transactions are processed by 20 validators and they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=852.9s	852.9	 a top 20 based on holdings of souls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=856.1s	856.1	 So it's kind of like this proof of stake model.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=858.1s	858.1	 So anyway, there's some trade offs there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=860.0s	860.0	 I can tell you that, you know, it's the view of, you know, our friends at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=864.3s	864.3	 MultiCoin and, you know, I heard a lot of this views at the conference, although
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=868.4s	868.4	 obviously you have taken with a grain of salt because these are the biggest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=871.1s	871.1	 believers, but their view is that Solana over the next year will flip Ethereum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=876.5s	876.5	 based on developer activity that there's real.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=879.7s	879.7	 To your point, we spend a lot of time actually before we do anything is that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=883.7s	883.7	 the only thing we've been looking at, you know, and.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=887.0s	887.0	 Syndica, Fractal, a lot of the stuff that we've done, DSo is purely driven by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=894.0s	894.0	 developer interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=894.8s	894.8	 When we see developers in the open source ecosystem, building things on top
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=898.8s	898.8	 of this stuff, making stuff that's composable and usable by other people and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=902.1s	902.1	 building infrastructure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=904.2s	904.2	 You know, we don't really second guess that because they are spending their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=908.0s	908.0	 the most important currency, which is not monetary capital, but human capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=912.9s	912.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=913.7s	913.7	 There's a time and there's skill and the reputation for another project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=916.6s	916.6	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=916.9s	916.9	 And so when enough developers, so I I've always thought you just follow the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=920.4s	920.4	 developers and as more and more projects get started, you just have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=924.5s	924.5	 unemotionally support that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=926.0s	926.0	 I think the writing is on the wall, which is Bitcoin is gold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=929.9s	929.9	 Ethereum looks like it's trending to be silver and Solana could be the first,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=934.1s	934.1	 but there will be others that come after it of real developer ecosystems that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=938.4s	938.4	 can be built on top of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=939.4s	939.4	 The other, the other thing that I would offer up to people for them to think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=942.7s	942.7	 about is before you blindly go and rush into crypto, one way in which I try to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=949.2s	949.2	 think about these things is in the following way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=951.8s	951.8	 You see these projects get started all the time and I would view each of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=956.7s	956.7	 projects as a mini economy and really try to think what is the economic value of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=962.4s	962.4	 what's happening under the hood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=963.5s	963.5	 So simple example, you know, helium is an interesting project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=966.4s	966.4	 That's trying to build a completely decentralized, you know, 5g
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=969.8s	969.8	 infrastructure, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=971.3s	971.3	 Render is a really interesting project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=973.5s	973.5	 That's trying to build a completely decentralized, you know, graphical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=976.5s	976.5	 processing infrastructure, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=978.1s	978.1	 GPUs essentially.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=980.1s	980.1	 In both of those things, you can quantifiably economically measure what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=985.1s	985.1	 value is that people get, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=987.0s	987.0	 In the case of render, you're basically displacing an AWS instance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=991.9s	991.9	 And so that has a price and a value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=995.1s	995.1	 And so, you know, for render to be valuable, there's an economic value that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=998.8s	998.8	 it replaces if you're joining a hotspot that has an economic value where you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1003.5s	1003.5	 had necessarily have to pay, you know, to get internet connectivity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1006.7s	1006.7	 If you all of a sudden are on the helium network that displaces a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1010.1s	1010.1	 measurable economic quantum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1012.5s	1012.5	 Understanding that is probably and taking the absolute value of that is the best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1016.7s	1016.7	 way of really understanding which projects have potential.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1019.1s	1019.1	 So if you take those two ideas and marry them together, where is their developer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1023.1s	1023.1	 interest and where is their measurable economic activity at the intersection of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1026.9s	1026.9	 those, I think are the really compelling projects that can win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1029.5s	1029.5	 Well, the thing that complicates all of this is that the developers are not just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1033.0s	1033.0	 picking based on which language or technology or stack they think has the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1036.9s	1036.9	 potential. They also have acquired economic stakes in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1040.6s	1040.6	 So a developer who might be objective and say, hey, this new platform is better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1044.8s	1044.8	 than aetherium might be sitting on millions of dollars in aetherium.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1049.1s	1049.1	 And they're like, I want to keep my bet going here and I'm going to keep talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1054.1s	1054.1	 my book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1054.7s	1054.7	 Possibly. But I, but I do think that developers in general will choose the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1058.6s	1058.6	 platform that's easiest and cheapest and fastest for them to develop on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1063.1s	1063.1	 Which would mean the list on coin market cap of market ones that has been static
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1067.7s	1067.7	 for a decade of crypto almost, you know, or largely the top 10 doesn't change that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1071.9s	1071.9	 much. It's XRP, it's stellar, Ethereum, Bitcoin, tether, that could be up for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1076.7s	1076.7	 grabs. That whole thing could change now that people are actually building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1079.5s	1079.5	 projects and the projects are getting competitive with each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1083.4s	1083.4	 And that's that flippening we're talking about. Correct, Sax?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1086.3s	1086.3	 Yeah, I think that what's tricky here again is I never want to give anyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1090.9s	1090.9	 investment advice. I mean, that's just not my job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1094.3s	1094.3	 And if there's anyone out there listening to the show because they're trying to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1097.8s	1097.8	 like tips or tricks, whatever, for investment, like I'm not really comfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1101.3s	1101.3	 telling people what to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1104.1s	1104.1	 So, you know, everyone just has to understand that I did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1106.9s	1106.9	 I do feel like what I saw at this conference over the past week in terms of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1111.2s	1111.2	 developer enthusiasm activity was very bullish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1113.5s	1113.5	 Actually, it was a lot like I went to the Ethereum conference, I think it was back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1118.0s	1118.0	 in 2017, several years ago, and it felt a little bit like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1121.3s	1121.3	 Although I would say that this time it felt less academic, like several years ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1125.6s	1125.6	 it felt more like white papers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1126.8s	1126.8	 Now it actually feels like real projects and businesses that people are trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1130.5s	1130.5	 create. Still infrastructure and less applications or more applications.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1133.8s	1133.8	 Well, Chamath mentioned a couple of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1137.3s	1137.3	 So there's Helium, which is creating a decentralized network for Wi-Fi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1140.7s	1140.7	 There's Render, which is creating a decentralized network for GPU.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1144.3s	1144.3	 There's one called HiveMapper where I met the founder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1147.0s	1147.0	 It's a decentralized network for people to map the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1149.4s	1149.4	 You can think of the concept of a miner that Bitcoin invented.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1152.5s	1152.5	 Think of them more as like a resource provider to a network.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1156.4s	1156.4	 So with Bitcoin, we call them miners, but they're the validators of transactions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1160.7s	1160.7	 And we're trying to incentivize them through block rewards, basically through small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1164.3s	1164.3	 bits of Bitcoin that get released to to provide these valuable computing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1170.1s	1170.1	 resources to the network.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1171.3s	1171.3	 And so people are figuring out now how to create massively decentralized networks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1175.1s	1175.1	 where you have thousands or millions of resource providers provide a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1179.2s	1179.2	 of something to the network for everyone's benefit in exchange to get some coin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1183.3s	1183.3	 That's like a really interesting model that couldn't exist before crypto.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1187.9s	1187.9	 And so, yeah, I mean, I think it's very interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1190.9s	1190.9	 But in order for that to work, you have to have like very unique,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1195.2s	1195.2	 fast, efficient, scalable blockchains.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1197.5s	1197.5	 And the feeling as I mean, I'll give credit here to Tushar,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1202.9s	1202.9	 who's one of the GPs of MultiCoin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1205.1s	1205.1	 His view is that this was the iPhone moment for blockchain, that what Solana has built
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1210.0s	1210.0	 because it's massively scalable and also very cheap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1212.7s	1212.7	 I mean, again, you can run a lot of transactions for pennies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1215.9s	1215.9	 Now, all of that is obviously very bullish for Solana.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1218.9s	1218.9	 The thing I wrestle with is and Chamath kind of allude to this is I think everything's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1222.8s	1222.8	 kind of in a bubble right now because of monetary and fiscal policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1226.6s	1226.6	 And so, you know, I guess I you could say that I'm long Solana versus ETH,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1231.7s	1231.7	 but I do kind of worry that the whole world right now is very bubbly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1235.7s	1235.7	 And so as a GP, like, what do you do about that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1238.4s	1238.4	 I can tell you right now, like this second, we are sitting on Solana that we have not sold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1243.7s	1243.7	 So, you know, I am long in that sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1245.7s	1245.7	 However, sometime over the next whatever number of years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1248.8s	1248.8	 we will distribute out our position of Solana to LPs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1252.3s	1252.3	 And then the LPs will make their decisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1253.6s	1253.6	 And then they will make their decisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1254.8s	1254.8	 Might specialize in crypto and want to keep it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1257.1s	1257.1	 Other ones might not want to hold assets and need that money to fund their endowment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1260.8s	1260.8	 to give scholarships to students or whatever your LPs particularly do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1265.3s	1265.3	 Well, yeah, I mean, and so I guess to the issue of, hey, we're not giving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1269.3s	1269.3	 investment advice here, we are all capital allocators and startup creators.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1274.2s	1274.2	 So we're talking about our day to day lives here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1276.8s	1276.8	 Nobody should interpret this as investment advice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1279.6s	1279.6	 and especially not in a world now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1281.7s	1281.7	 I don't know if you guys saw what happened with Rivian this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1283.9s	1283.9	 I don't know how we don't talk about a company with essentially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1289.1s	1289.1	 no public sales.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1290.3s	1290.3	 They've sold one hundred forty eight cars to their employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1292.8s	1292.8	 It's worth one hundred and twenty billion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1296.3s	1296.3	 Any free bird? Did you see this IPO? Any thoughts on it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1300.4s	1300.4	 Seems like you have investment advice for the audience that you'd like to give.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1304.5s	1304.5	 Tell me what Rivian does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1307.7s	1307.7	 Can you play that video that you found that you shared with everyone?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1310.8s	1310.8	 You have that video?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1312.1s	1312.1	 OK, well, we do have it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1314.0s	1314.0	 I could we could chew it up. Did you see this yet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1315.5s	1315.5	 So who is this guy? No, I haven't. Oh, that. Yeah. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1317.9s	1317.9	 Well, but just so I don't want to beat this point to death.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1320.4s	1320.4	 But I just think it's so important for the audience that what they should be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1322.9s	1322.9	 getting out of the show, if they're fans, is maybe like advice on how to think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1327.3s	1327.3	 Critical thinking and how we think about investors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1330.9s	1330.9	 First principles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1332.2s	1332.2	 Exactly. So look, if you want to invest in crypto,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1335.4s	1335.4	 first of all, like, go understand, like what all these different projects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1339.0s	1339.0	 or blockchains do and figure out what is the purpose of the token in that system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1343.4s	1343.4	 What are the token economics?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1345.4s	1345.4	 Yeah. Does it even make sense? Or is it just a scam?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1348.1s	1348.1	 Then if it's a if it's something like a blockchain, go research.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1351.2s	1351.2	 How many projects are have developers on them and how much code is being checked in?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1356.1s	1356.1	 And maybe open a wallet and buy some NFTs and buy some ETH
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1359.5s	1359.5	 and transfer it and learn just how to set up your Internet connection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1363.7s	1363.7	 Right. Right. This was 1995. Right. Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1366.6s	1366.6	 And then on top of all that, you got to consider macro forces because I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1370.1s	1370.1	 and I think, you know, my friends at Multicom would fully concede this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1373.8s	1373.8	 that, you know, it could be the case that if there's a crypto bust
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1378.3s	1378.3	 over the next year and this thing, you know, crypto has gone through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1380.6s	1380.6	 boom and bust cycles for many, many years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1382.5s	1382.5	 That is the standard. It's the standard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1384.3s	1384.3	 So you could have a situation in which, for example, Solana flips ETH
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1388.1s	1388.1	 and yet still goes down in value because there's an overall bust cycle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1391.6s	1391.6	 So, you know, you have to consider the macro economic factors as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1395.1s	1395.1	 So there's a lot of things to consider here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1396.7s	1396.7	 And then you also have to consider your own risk tolerance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1399.2s	1399.2	 And, you know, what is appropriate for your portfolio?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1402.2s	1402.2	 And it may be different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1403.0s	1403.0	 When do you need your money? Are you a 25 year old?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1405.1s	1405.1	 Everything is at all time highs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1407.2s	1407.2	 And the two smartest men in the world are selling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1410.7s	1410.7	 Not just not just them, by the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1412.9s	1412.9	 There are other guys that are heavily on the other side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1414.9s	1414.9	 waiting for this whole thing to go like Druckenmiller has been very vocal about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1419.6s	1419.6	 And he's he's been the best macro trader in the last 30 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1423.7s	1423.7	 So his position is what exactly that we're printing too much money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1428.1s	1428.1	 and we're in a lot of trouble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1429.8s	1429.8	 So, you know, look, I mean, generally, there is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1433.5s	1433.5	 I think, a good point of view being shared here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1436.4s	1436.4	 which is, you know, understanding how to think about what you're investing in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1440.7s	1440.7	 and what your your expectations are versus relying on someone's advice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1445.0s	1445.0	 or opinion on what to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1446.7s	1446.7	 If you have to rely on someone else's advice or opinion on what to do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1450.1s	1450.1	 you're going to eventually lose money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1452.3s	1452.3	 You should not be in that investment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1453.9s	1453.9	 You should not be in the market, because guess what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1455.6s	1455.6	 Anyone that's giving you advice or opinions is going to make money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1458.7s	1458.7	 if you do what they tell you to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1460.0s	1460.0	 If you do what they tell you to do. End of story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1462.5s	1462.5	 So at some point, they're going to all make money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1465.2s	1465.2	 and you're going to end up losing money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1467.9s	1467.9	 And it's a it's you know, it's it's it's a better game to play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1471.7s	1471.7	 to learn how to kind of be thoughtful about where's your money going,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1474.2s	1474.2	 what are you investing in?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1475.0s	1475.0	 And it takes a lot of time and a lot of money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1476.5s	1476.5	 I've been sitting here silently as you guys have been talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1479.6s	1479.6	 deeply about Solana and Ethereum and Bitcoin and the crypto markets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1483.8s	1483.8	 because I realized so much of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1487.2s	1487.2	 you know, what's needed to be successful in entering this market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1490.3s	1490.3	 is a depth of understanding, a depth of knowledge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1492.2s	1492.2	 My time is highly limited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1493.8s	1493.8	 I have spent no time understanding crypto markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1497.1s	1497.1	 because it's so deep and it's so fluid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1499.0s	1499.0	 It's changing every day. It's changing every week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1501.3s	1501.3	 So if I can't get smart enough to feel confident about the opinions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1504.5s	1504.5	 and decisions that I would be making as an investor,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1506.9s	1506.9	 I decide not to invest and I stay out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1508.7s	1508.7	 And so I'm not an active crypto investor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1510.6s	1510.6	 You're a specialist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1512.1s	1512.1	 And you're on the razor's edge on synthetic biology and so many other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1516.3s	1516.3	 Whatever it is, there are other areas where it's better for me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1518.5s	1518.5	 to spend my time and my energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1520.1s	1520.1	 And I've chosen to do that versus being drawn into what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1523.0s	1523.0	 what feels like a very exciting kind of, you know, turbulent time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1527.2s	1527.2	 There are other areas that I kind of spend my time on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1529.0s	1529.0	 And I just kind of try to recognize that maybe I don't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1531.7s	1531.7	 what I'm doing if I were to try and get involved here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1533.8s	1533.8	 And so I'd rather stay out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1534.9s	1534.9	 And I think that's counsel for for anyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1537.3s	1537.3	 You know, if you're going to make an investment, it's important to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1539.5s	1539.5	 feel confident about the knowledge and the depth needed to kind of be different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1543.7s	1543.7	 than the rest of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1544.5s	1544.5	 I'll build on your point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1545.3s	1545.3	 Like when I when I started doing my SPACs, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1550.3s	1550.3	 started to write these one pages and those one pages were artifacts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1553.5s	1553.5	 for me to hold myself accountable for how I saw something in a moment in time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1558.0s	1558.0	 and then to be able to see whether it was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1562.8s	1562.8	 Tracking to that and then also to share it to other people, a starting point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1565.9s	1565.9	 as David said, a journey where they should then, if they're curious,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1568.5s	1568.5	 go and do their own work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1569.9s	1569.9	 It turned out not enough people were doing the work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1571.6s	1571.6	 So then I had to start adding disclaimers to these things saying, hey, guys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1575.3s	1575.3	 I'm not telling you to buy this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1576.7s	1576.7	 Please be abundantly clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1579.1s	1579.1	 These next SPACs that I will eventually launch,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1582.7s	1582.7	 you're going to see an entire like in red block letters,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1587.0s	1587.0	 like, please don't buy this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1588.8s	1588.8	 Right. Because to your point, it doesn't matter what you say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1592.0s	1592.0	 People want a lazy, easy way out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1594.3s	1594.3	 And so I just want to reiterate what all of you guys said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1596.5s	1596.5	 None of us are dispensing advice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1599.5s	1599.5	 We are not telling you to do anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1602.0s	1602.0	 Please do your own work and please come to your conclusion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1605.3s	1605.3	 It is your responsibility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1607.1s	1607.1	 And if you're not sure, go and look at your children in the face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1609.9s	1609.9	 or your significant other in the face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1611.9s	1611.9	 You are responsible to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1614.5s	1614.5	 And so do your own work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1616.9s	1616.9	 I'll say one more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1619.7s	1619.7	 point on where I sit as an investor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1622.9s	1622.9	 I choose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1625.0s	1625.0	 to only participate in investing in what I call productive assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1629.3s	1629.3	 That is, you put some money into something and whatever that thing is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1633.1s	1633.1	 is generating money in some way or is trying to generate value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1636.6s	1636.6	 through a set of activities like a business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1640.5s	1640.5	 or owning an apartment building where you're making rent, you know, anything that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1644.5s	1644.5	 or, you know, a group of people that are trying to have some breakthrough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1647.5s	1647.5	 or some discovery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1648.9s	1648.9	 Those are productive assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1650.5s	1650.5	 There's a lot of what's going on now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1652.9s	1652.9	 That is what I would call speculative assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1654.9s	1654.9	 Which is the only way you make money is if someone else pays more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1658.5s	1658.5	 in the future versus what you're paying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1661.1s	1661.1	 And there isn't an underlying productive asset to what you're putting money into.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1665.7s	1665.7	 Are you describing every ICO or every ICO, every NFT and the art market?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1670.5s	1670.5	 Right. These are these are examples of unproductive assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1673.8s	1673.8	 They're speculative assets in the sense that you're speculating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1676.3s	1676.3	 that at some point, the price of them are going to go up and someone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1678.6s	1678.6	 somebody wants that NFT more than someone down the road will pay more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1682.5s	1682.5	 for that asset than what you paid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1684.2s	1684.2	 But that underlying asset, that capital that you just put in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1687.0s	1687.0	 didn't go in to build something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1689.1s	1689.1	 It's no one new generation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1690.8s	1690.8	 There's no IP.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1691.7s	1691.7	 It went into someone else's pocket that sold that asset to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1694.7s	1694.7	 And you're eventually going to try and sell it to someone else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1697.0s	1697.0	 And so, you know, there's a there's a real attraction here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1701.0s	1701.0	 because what we just talked about is really hard to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1703.1s	1703.1	 Having fundamental analysis and understanding of businesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1706.0s	1706.0	 and a fundamental understanding of what's working and what's not and when to shift.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1709.1s	1709.1	 And, oh, my gosh, you know, are things different or are they not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1712.3s	1712.3	 To do that is really hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1714.2s	1714.2	 So people end up relying on opinions of others
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1716.7s	1716.7	 or they end up running into speculative markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1718.7s	1718.7	 And the speculative markets are easy to understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1721.0s	1721.0	 Someone just paid more for X than the other person did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1723.7s	1723.7	 Therefore, there's a trend line. It's going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1725.3s	1725.3	 It's like playing roulette.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1726.8s	1726.8	 And, you know, black keeps coming up and you're like, OK, it's going to be black again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1729.9s	1729.9	 It has to be black. There were seven. Correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1731.4s	1731.4	 There were seven blacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1732.3s	1732.3	 And so I think that that's a really important kind of takeaway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1735.4s	1735.4	 for folks that might be new as investors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1738.0s	1738.0	 We're all susceptible. We're all susceptible to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1740.3s	1740.3	 Like I was just looking, you know, at my own performance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1744.3s	1744.3	 coming into the end of this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1746.2s	1746.2	 And, you know, I did a lot of SPACs this year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1750.5s	1750.5	 but I also did these pipes, which are these third party deals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1754.3s	1754.3	 Private investment in public entities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1756.1s	1756.1	 Exactly. Other people's deals that they were bringing to the market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1759.5s	1759.5	 where they said, Jamath, do you want to be a part of it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1762.1s	1762.1	 And, you know, and I did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1764.1s	1764.1	 And part of it was I was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1767.3s	1767.3	 Looking at these things and, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1770.2s	1770.2	 Freebird doing my work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1771.7s	1771.7	 But in the end, it turned out I didn't do nearly as much as I probably should have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1775.4s	1775.4	 because I ended up sitting on top of other people's work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1778.5s	1778.5	 versus the original or underwriting that I would do if it was my own deal itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1782.1s	1782.1	 Right. Anyways, the net net of it all is like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1785.3s	1785.3	 that was very inefficient capital deployment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1787.5s	1787.5	 And as I look at it now, it's like, you know, I'm down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1790.3s	1790.3	 Well, I'm technically up 19 percent, but that's really because of one deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1794.7s	1794.7	 If I take that one deal out, which was a total outlier,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1796.8s	1796.8	 I'm down 17 percent on about 200 million dollars of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1799.4s	1799.4	 When you are a fast follower, not the originator, it wasn't your idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1802.8s	1802.8	 This is critically important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1804.0s	1804.0	 There are many different ways to make money, but you have to specialize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1806.9s	1806.9	 and you have to have first and your knowledge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1809.3s	1809.3	 I trusted other people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1811.8s	1811.8	 I did the same thing that I that I'm saying to other people about to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1814.3s	1814.3	 Do not just copy other people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1816.2s	1816.2	 You have to do your own principal work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1818.1s	1818.1	 And even when you do your own principal work, it may not be enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1821.1s	1821.1	 And you have to be willing to basically see the forest from the trees and walk away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1824.8s	1824.8	 And so all these pipes, I'm in the midst of sort of cleaning up and selling down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1828.7s	1828.7	 And they've been just a kind of a disaster for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1831.1s	1831.1	 You know, hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1832.3s	1832.3	 I want to build on this for a second, because I think it's critically important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1835.1s	1835.1	 What you said as well, Friedberg, you have to be comfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1837.9s	1837.9	 with the investments you're making.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1838.9s	1838.9	 I look at these companies and I look at the underlying customer, the product,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1842.9s	1842.9	 you know, and what kind of revenue it's going to generate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1844.8s	1844.8	 And people thought I was dunking on Rivian yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1847.1s	1847.1	 And I said, listen, you know, when Tesla went public,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1849.6s	1849.6	 people forget their valuation was one point five billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1852.1s	1852.1	 One point seven.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1853.1s	1853.1	 One point. OK, so one point seven billion when they went public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1856.3s	1856.3	 Now, they already had thousands of roadsters and they had already had the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1862.2s	1862.2	 93 million of revenue in year one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1864.4s	1864.4	 So this was dramatically different than what Rivian had.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1868.4s	1868.4	 Rivian is being valued at, you know, whatever that is, 120 billion, I think, yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1872.7s	1872.7	 Rivian has 17 billion cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1874.0s	1874.0	 Somebody asked me at the poker game last night what I value Rivian at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1877.9s	1877.9	 I said 17 plus three, 17 million cash plus three billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1883.0s	1883.0	 Double roughly what Tesla's was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1885.1s	1885.1	 The market's hotter right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1886.3s	1886.3	 Whatever. But I put them at 20 billion and people were giving a hard time about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1889.0s	1889.0	 I said, I think that's actually the realistic valuation for this company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1892.2s	1892.2	 And we are in a very dangerous moment in time right now where I think people are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1896.5s	1896.5	 whether it's meme stocks or crypto or NFTs, suspending disbelief, in some cases,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1901.5s	1901.5	 SPACs because they're not all created equal and certainly in private companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1905.0s	1905.0	 We're seeing this where people are giving people an amount of credit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1909.3s	1909.3	 which makes no logical sense and is getting further and further
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1913.0s	1913.0	 disconnected from reality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1914.7s	1914.7	 So as an investor, you have a choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1916.3s	1916.3	 Either you have your fundamentals, which I'm not going to change my fundamentals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1919.9s	1919.9	 I'm going to focus on the fundamentals that got me where I am.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1922.8s	1922.8	 And I'm not going to be involved in a hundred billion dollar market cap company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1927.1s	1927.1	 that hasn't launched a product yet, let alone 120 billion dollar one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1930.7s	1930.7	 I'll stay focused on startups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1932.5s	1932.5	 But what you're saying is also important because you're highlighting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1937.1s	1937.1	 how you value that company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1939.2s	1939.2	 You individually said, I think that company is worth some multiple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1942.7s	1942.7	 of how many cars have been sold in the past.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1945.0s	1945.0	 Elon sold thousands of cars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1947.1s	1947.1	 He was worth one point seven billion. These guys have sold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1949.3s	1949.3	 And other people are coming in and looking at this company and saying they've built
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1952.8s	1952.8	 facilities, they've built assembly lines, and they've got preorders and bookings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1956.5s	1956.5	 for lots and lots of cars in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1958.5s	1958.5	 And clearly, they've gone in and some people have gone in and seen these plants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1961.5s	1961.5	 and seen these cars actually working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1963.3s	1963.3	 So it's really important to take note that your point of view is one point of view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1967.9s	1967.9	 in a very diverse market with many points of view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1970.3s	1970.3	 And everyone's going to come into this market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1971.8s	1971.8	 And that's why unless you individually as an investor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1974.9s	1974.9	 have a strong point of view and can show that you can apply your unique insights
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1979.5s	1979.5	 to consistently beat the market, making decisions, investment decisions like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1983.5s	1983.5	 you're eventually going to lose because those other points of view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1985.6s	1985.6	 will be a bigger view of the truth and you'll lose money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1988.8s	1988.8	 And that's why I say that. And that, by the way, that's why picking stocks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1992.0s	1992.0	 is ultimately a loser's game unless you have some unique ability and insight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1996.3s	1996.3	 for most people historically and in an upmarket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=1998.4s	1998.4	 You need to have everyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2000.2s	2000.2	 Right. You need to have an edge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2001.1s	2001.1	 And the public markets are hard to say that there's some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2003.6s	2003.6	 inside competency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2004.8s	2004.8	 Yeah, there's some unique competency that you need to bring to the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2006.9s	2006.9	 I mean, if we double click on what you just said as the things that would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2009.5s	2009.5	 reasons to bet on Rivian, number one, they have 48000 orders of pickup trucks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2015.7s	2015.7	 against the F-150, which is now electric from Ford and a million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2020.2s	2020.2	 I don't know why you're arguing this, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2021.5s	2021.5	 Like you're just making a point that we don't have someone on the on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2024.3s	2024.3	 on the panel right now, but someone else could come in and argue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2026.5s	2026.5	 OK, go ahead, Chumak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2027.4s	2027.4	 And I would just say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2029.9s	2029.9	 this is the part of the conversation, to be honest, Jason, to give you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2032.7s	2032.7	 feedback I don't like, because.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2035.3s	2035.3	 Rivian, just in defense of Rivian for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2039.0s	2039.0	 What I have heard is that it's a it's a well engineered car or truck rather.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2044.7s	2044.7	 They've done a very smart path to market, which is essentially to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2049.2s	2049.2	 you know, build these delivery trucks for Amazon that allowed them to even,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2055.2s	2055.2	 Sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2055.5s	2055.5	 You know, to use the hologram term instead of default dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2059.3s	2059.3	 I think the point that's more important here is that it doesn't affect you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2063.3s	2063.3	 So let Rivian do well, you know, and this is part of the.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2068.5s	2068.5	 You shouldn't have an opinion publicly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2069.9s	2069.9	 No, no, no, I'm just saying this is the part of the cycle that I don't understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2073.1s	2073.1	 where people legitimately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2077.3s	2077.3	 Have these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2079.3s	2079.3	 Zero some points of view about companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2083.1s	2083.1	 and this is where I think Freiburg is more right than anybody else, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2087.3s	2087.3	 there are the market is the sum of all these collective points of view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2090.9s	2090.9	 Sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2091.4s	2091.4	 And I think it's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2092.9s	2092.9	 I think it's fine to have one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2095.5s	2095.5	 I think it's a little superficial, your point of view, because it's not really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2098.3s	2098.3	 house, you know, sitting on top of a model or anything else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2100.6s	2100.6	 And I think it's the same kind of superficiality that the Tesla Q
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2104.0s	2104.0	 guys had about Tesla for many years as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2107.1s	2107.1	 It takes a long time as somebody that does this every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2110.5s	2110.5	 And I just want to point this out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2112.1s	2112.1	 It takes an enormous amount of time and enormous amount of work to be 55 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2117.5s	2117.5	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2117.7s	2117.7	 In 350 companies, I meet with the public markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2120.5s	2120.5	 Jason, it's different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2121.5s	2121.5	 The public markets are going public now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2122.9s	2122.9	 So I take exception to what you're saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2124.3s	2124.3	 I know a fraud when I see it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2125.6s	2125.6	 I've seen them before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2126.8s	2126.8	 Oh, that's a really big statement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2128.1s	2128.1	 That's not a fraud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2129.5s	2129.5	 No, but the distance between the valuation and reality is in the 50 to 100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2135.4s	2135.4	 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2135.7s	2135.7	 I know, but that's not in control of that's not in their control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2139.7s	2139.7	 OK, that's in a bunch of external market participants control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2142.9s	2142.9	 So you can't pin that on them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2144.9s	2144.9	 My point is, the market right now seems dysfunctional and it's not properly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2149.5s	2149.5	 measured. But throwing shade that you then you should throw shade at Tiro
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2154.5s	2154.5	 Fidelity, all these people that are bidding up your companies, by the way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2157.6s	2157.6	 because they are the ones that are taking review into 120 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2160.3s	2160.3	 It's not review and fall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2161.7s	2161.7	 And Jason, what's really going on in the market was probably speculators.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2164.7s	2164.7	 No, what's really going on is not that you can't sell 16 billion dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2169.1s	2169.1	 in an IPO to speculators.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2170.9s	2170.9	 This is a much lower price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2172.7s	2172.7	 But these are institutionally placed trade orders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2176.2s	2176.2	 But regardless, the market is clearly right now in productive assets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2180.6s	2180.6	 businesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2181.6s	2181.6	 The market is looking at a time horizon that it has never looked at before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2185.7s	2185.7	 which is making bets that are 10, 15, 20 years in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2189.3s	2189.3	 And that's because of the condition that we're in right now from a monetary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2192.1s	2192.1	 policy point of view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2193.3s	2193.3	 Interest rates are so low, there's nowhere to get yield in other assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2196.8s	2196.8	 So you have to look further and further out to find value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2199.2s	2199.2	 I accept that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2199.8s	2199.8	 The market is betting is making 10 year bets, which is like a VC type.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2203.4s	2203.4	 More than a 10 year bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2204.5s	2204.5	 Yeah. And Jason, sorry, can I just finish my last point before you interrupt me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2209.7s	2209.7	 My issue, Jason, is I think you are an exceptional angel investor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2213.1s	2213.1	 But just the same way you derided a bunch of late stage guys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2216.2s	2216.2	 remember last night at poker, when we were talking about late stage folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2219.7s	2219.7	 entering into the angel market and the series A, you were extremely dismissive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2224.9s	2224.9	 because you know what the job is to be done to do that job well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2229.5s	2229.5	 and they have a different skill set.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2230.9s	2230.9	 Similarly, what I would just offer for you to think about is the people that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2234.5s	2234.5	 really underwrite public market stocks well, do things and have a skill set
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2239.0s	2239.0	 that is extremely specific and it is well trained as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2242.9s	2242.9	 And I think that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2244.7s	2244.7	 Okay, I accept that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2245.9s	2245.9	 I'll defend me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2247.0s	2247.0	 Let me jump into the J.K.S. defense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2248.4s	2248.4	 If you want to defend me, that's the people are in shock right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2250.8s	2250.8	 So we're going to let you speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2252.1s	2252.1	 We need to get yourself back in the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2253.5s	2253.5	 This guy is purple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2254.8s	2254.8	 This guy is purple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2255.7s	2255.7	 The moon is set.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2258.9s	2258.9	 Hell is freezing over right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2262.2s	2262.2	 So here's where I think J.K.L.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2263.3s	2263.3	 I don't know anything about this reviewing company,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2264.8s	2264.8	 but where I think J.K.L. is right is we've seen over and over again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2268.1s	2268.1	 that when a company gets, when a startup gets a billion dollar plus valuation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2273.5s	2273.5	 without a product invariably, it ends up somewhere between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2278.5s	2278.5	 a disappointment and outright fraud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2280.6s	2280.6	 Whether it was Theranos or Magic Leap or Quibi or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2287.2s	2287.2	 I'm not saying they're all frauds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2288.5s	2288.5	 I mean, I think just Theranos frauds, whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2292.5s	2292.5	 So I think it's reasonable for any, let's say seed or early venture investor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2297.6s	2297.6	 to develop the heuristic that I'm not going to invest in anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2301.3s	2301.3	 with a billion dollar with basically unicorn valuation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2304.3s	2304.3	 without seeing the product first, because we've learned we've got our hands burnt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2308.4s	2308.4	 so many times from these overhyped companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2311.0s	2311.0	 And here's where I agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2312.5s	2312.5	 If I can't see and use the product, I'm not investing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2315.3s	2315.3	 I'll invest in a seed stage, but I will not invest in a unicorn stage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2318.5s	2318.5	 No way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2319.5s	2319.5	 I agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2320.4s	2320.4	 But what I'm saying is when a company is going public like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2323.1s	2323.1	 there is demonstrable proof of concept there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2326.1s	2326.1	 OK, the only market in which that's not true is in biotechnology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2329.6s	2329.6	 Well, I would say for Fisker and Nikola, two related companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2332.5s	2332.5	 those ones seem very, very shaky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2334.9s	2334.9	 You can debate about the scalability of these things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2337.1s	2337.1	 and you can debate that people didn't do the diligence,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2339.0s	2339.0	 but they had to at least put a proof of concept out there for you to judge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2342.7s	2342.7	 If people don't do the work, I agree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2344.4s	2344.4	 Like if you're rolling a truck down a hill, sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2347.5s	2347.5	 Outright fraud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2348.4s	2348.4	 No, but my point is if you were there and you did your work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2350.6s	2350.6	 you would have seen what you needed to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2352.2s	2352.2	 What I have heard from people who are investors in both Lucid and Rivian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2356.5s	2356.5	 is that they have sat in the cars, they've driven the cars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2359.4s	2359.4	 they've spent time with them, they've seen the factories,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2362.5s	2362.5	 and it's very much real.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2364.5s	2364.5	 Now what they're debating is ramp and velocity and scale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2367.8s	2367.8	 I don't know. I don't have a position in either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2370.5s	2370.5	 I have the bigger macro point of view, which is important to me, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2375.5s	2375.5	 just because these things are in the public markets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2377.4s	2377.4	 I think people think it's easy to judge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2379.6s	2379.6	 And I think actually modeling them and making good decisions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2382.1s	2382.1	 is just as hard as it is for private companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2383.9s	2383.9	 We need to roll this clip because there is somebody who is giving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2386.5s	2386.5	 exceptional advice on CNBC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2390.3s	2390.3	 Let's roll the clip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2391.5s	2391.5	 Yeah, so well, Upstart's up about 25% just in four days since we bought it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2396.3s	2396.3	 We bought it on about four days ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2398.9s	2398.9	 So that's actually made a nice little move in the short term,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2402.1s	2402.1	 probably a little extended right now, but longer term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2405.7s	2405.7	 That's a good looking name, very powerful, very strong earnings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2410.1s	2410.1	 These stocks are actually doing well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2411.0s	2411.0	 What do they do? I don't even know them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2412.2s	2412.2	 What do they do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2414.9s	2414.9	 Excuse me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2415.3s	2415.3	 What does Upstart do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2418.0s	2418.0	 Well, I'm sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2421.3s	2421.3	 What kind of company is it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2423.4s	2423.4	 Yeah, you're breaking up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2425.1s	2425.1	 Oh, I'm sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2430.5s	2430.5	 Brutal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2431.5s	2431.5	 Who is this guy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2432.5s	2432.5	 Who is he?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2433.5s	2433.5	 I have no idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2434.3s	2434.3	 Jake, is that like your uncle or something?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2436.5s	2436.5	 Who is that guy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2437.2s	2437.2	 Listen, I mean, just to the point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2440.5s	2440.5	 CNBC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2442.1s	2442.1	 Well, you know, the guy's been on many times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2445.1s	2445.1	 But doesn't this prove what we were saying, which is that you've got to do your own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2448.1s	2448.1	 principal work here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2449.7s	2449.7	 That is why we wanted to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2450.9s	2450.9	 Here's a talking head who's probably getting paid for selling some books and giving advice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2454.6s	2454.6	 Who knows nothing about what he's telling you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2456.5s	2456.5	 You can join his membership club for 1000 a month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2459.3s	2459.3	 I'm sure he's publishing lots of papers that show that he's a highly successful,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2463.2s	2463.2	 profitable investor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2464.2s	2464.2	 And look how smart he is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2465.6s	2465.6	 He doesn't even know the company he just promoted on CNBC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2468.1s	2468.1	 It's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2469.7s	2469.7	 On a mechanical basis here, Chamath, you and I have been on CNBC many times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2474.9s	2474.9	 In that moment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2476.4s	2476.4	 uh, what is going on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2478.8s	2478.8	 What do you think is going on in the host's mind?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2482.7s	2482.7	 And the producer who has to dump this call, because they're watching this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2486.8s	2486.8	 Let's move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2487.7s	2487.7	 I just the breakdown when he says, I'm sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2490.6s	2490.6	 I have no idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2491.5s	2491.5	 What do they do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2492.3s	2492.3	 I think the point's been made.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2493.4s	2493.4	 I think the point's been made.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2494.5s	2494.5	 Oh, my Lord.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2495.7s	2495.7	 Everybody should do their own work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2497.0s	2497.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2497.3s	2497.3	 Do your work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2499.9s	2499.9	 Sach, you look like you want to say something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2502.5s	2502.5	 I mean, it just shows the agenda.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2504.4s	2504.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2504.6s	2504.6	 Look, I mean, there is a massive agenda in corporate journalism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2508.8s	2508.8	 There's an agenda by the people on these shows to promote positions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2512.5s	2512.5	 There's an agenda by the reporters themselves and on and on and on it goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2517.3s	2517.3	 It's Chamath's point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2518.9s	2518.9	 If you just take on face value, you're and you don't do your own work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2522.7s	2522.7	 then you're buying into someone else's agenda.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2524.9s	2524.9	 Trust yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2526.1s	2526.1	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2526.9s	2526.9	 One thing that we are trying to all understand is inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2530.5s	2530.5	 The CPI has gone up 6.2% in October, highest jump in 31 years since 1990.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2535.3s	2535.3	 According to the Wall Street Journal, fifth largest straight month,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2537.6s	2537.6	 fifth straight month of inflation above 5%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2540.6s	2540.6	 You know, somebody tweeted out, we'll pull it up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2544.1s	2544.1	 Denver Bitcoin put out a year over year commodity chart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2548.1s	2548.1	 We can throw up on the screen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2550.1s	2550.1	 And then I think Friedberg, you shared in the chat, the end of the year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2555.1s	2555.1	 you shared in the chat, the end of the year, you shared in the chat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2558.5s	2558.5	 you shared in the chat, the average weekly retail prices around fertilizer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2565.9s	2565.9	 What are our thoughts on the nature of inflation and how that affects our investment?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2573.9s	2573.9	 I think it's persistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2575.5s	2575.5	 And the reason I think it's persistent is that there's a the all of these things are intertwined.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2581.4s	2581.4	 And so, you know, if you want to just bear with me for a second, like when,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2585.1s	2585.1	 let's go to the entry level economic job, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2589.1s	2589.1	 So you're a barista at Starbucks or you work at McDonald's and you're making $17 to $20 an hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2594.9s	2594.9	 What that does is it shifts labor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2597.8s	2597.8	 And eventually there are other people that are entering the workforce or may shift jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2603.1s	2603.1	 And essentially, it just causes this leaky bucket effect where everybody else has to then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2607.3s	2607.3	 accommodate itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2608.8s	2608.8	 So, you know, you have a guy like, you know, you have a company like Amazon,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2612.4s	2612.4	 which is now going to pay $25 or $30 to keep folks, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2616.3s	2616.3	 Because otherwise they may say, oh, you know, if I make $15 or $16 an hour,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2619.4s	2619.4	 I'd rather work at McDonald's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2620.5s	2620.5	 It's simpler.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2621.0s	2621.0	 And free college.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2621.9s	2621.9	 It's not backbreaking work, blah, blah, blah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2623.4s	2623.4	 So then they start to increase the amount that they pay, they increase their benefits and the like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2630.1s	2630.1	 I saw this thing this week, there's a crazy thing that's happening though,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2633.5s	2633.5	 which is it's now pulling people from non-traditional job classes into those jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2639.2s	2639.2	 There are teachers that are leaving teaching to go work at an Amazon warehouse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2643.9s	2643.9	 There are firefighters that are quitting being a firefighter to go work at an Amazon warehouse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2649.1s	2649.1	 because you make the same or more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2652.5s	2652.5	 Plus you have all of these other benefits and the job is structurally a lot easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2657.0s	2657.0	 And so people are making different optimizations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2659.7s	2659.7	 And to that point, I think we talked about this and Nick, you can put it in the group chat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2664.1s	2664.1	 In Reddit, as an example, there is more engagement in the subreddit around having a simple work life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2672.1s	2672.1	 than there is now in Wall Street bets, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2674.9s	2674.9	 So there's been a structural cultural change where people need to get paid more to do the same amount of work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2681.1s	2681.1	 And then at the same time, you have all of the, all of the supply side getting more expensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2686.0s	2686.0	 Fertilizer makes corn more expensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2688.4s	2688.4	 Lumber makes house prices more expensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2690.8s	2690.8	 Chip prices makes the iPhone and iPhone more expensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2693.6s	2693.6	 iPhone and cars more expensive or completely backlogged.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2696.9s	2696.9	 You know, yesterday a poker sunny was showing us he bought a Tesla and the delivery period is October of 2022.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2705.7s	2705.7	 Yeah, it's freaking crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2708.5s	2708.5	 So I think that it's a it's this is the beginning of a persistence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2712.0s	2712.0	 I think those are all like really valid points.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2714.0s	2714.0	 The thing I'm seeing now is I think we've moved into what I'll call a contagion phase of inflation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2720.8s	2720.8	 which is people are hearing about inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2723.3s	2723.3	 They're seeing it in some places, my guess went up a little bit, my milk went up a little bit, whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2727.6s	2727.6	 And they're saying, well, I guess if everybody's raising prices,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2730.8s	2730.8	 I need to raise the prices as well of whatever I provide in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2734.8s	2734.8	 So I can just keep up with everybody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2737.5s	2737.5	 And they're not looking at their inputs necessarily and saying I need to charge more or that's the best business decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2741.9s	2741.9	 They're just saying everything's going up around me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2744.3s	2744.3	 And so they raise prices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2745.4s	2745.4	 I've literally have this happen three or four times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2747.7s	2747.7	 And I went to buy a car and they wanted 15k over sticker and I didn't buy it based on principle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2752.4s	2752.4	 But I'm sitting here going like maybe I'm an idiot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2754.1s	2754.1	 Maybe I should just pay the 15k over stick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2755.7s	2755.7	 What are your thoughts, Saxon inflation and the contagion?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2758.3s	2758.3	 If you have any thoughts, my thoughts are I told you guys like six months ago about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2761.8s	2761.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2762.3s	2762.3	 Can we just replay what I said on episode 32?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2765.7s	2765.7	 It's got researchers in the background giving you written down what you said on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2769.7s	2769.7	 Yeah, absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2770.9s	2770.9	 No, this guy's in the fucking debate club, Stanford debate club.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2773.9s	2773.9	 Some of us when we make predictions, take them seriously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2776.4s	2776.4	 So, you know, is that a dig at Professor Ice Cold Takes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2780.0s	2780.0	 I'll give you guys a link to a prediction that was made.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2783.2s	2783.2	 I mean, I just want to replay the 20 seconds I said about this back in May.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2786.4s	2786.4	 Here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2786.9s	2786.9	 The two Davids dueling again, just like in the group chat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2789.7s	2789.7	 I'm not dueling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2790.1s	2790.1	 Here's Friedberg, January 1st, 2021.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2793.0s	2793.0	 If you don't think inflation is already here, you missed what happened to the stock market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2796.9s	2796.9	 Companies aren't performing better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2798.3s	2798.3	 We're just inflating everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2799.4s	2799.4	 Financial assets first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2800.5s	2800.5	 Everything else will follow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2801.3s	2801.3	 That was a good one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2802.1s	2802.1	 Sax, just make your point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2803.1s	2803.1	 Just make your point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2804.1s	2804.1	 Just add the clip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2806.1s	2806.1	 I began to wonder if Biden's going to be a Jimmy Carter here because frankly, all he had to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2811.8s	2811.8	 was leave things well enough alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2814.3s	2814.3	 COVID was winding down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2815.6s	2815.6	 We had a vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2816.7s	2816.7	 All they had to do was distribute it to as many people as possible, end COVID,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2821.1s	2821.1	 let the recovery take shape.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2822.9s	2822.9	 And instead, they pushed this insane $10 trillion agenda.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2827.3s	2827.3	 It's going to backfire massively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2828.7s	2828.7	 Look, if the economy turns, we were set for a post-COVID boom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2832.9s	2832.9	 And right now, that is all at risk because, Jamal, like you're saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2836.5s	2836.5	 they're keeping the economy closed or parts of it way too long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2839.9s	2839.9	 They then overcompensate for that by printing a ton of money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2843.5s	2843.5	 And then they overcompensate for that by raising taxes too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2846.6s	2846.6	 Just to build on that, that second step of their overcompensating,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2851.3s	2851.3	 their inability to open with money is so true because then what happens is your labor force
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2857.4s	2857.4	 stays impaired because people make enough money by not working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2862.0s	2862.0	 It was true when I said in May.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2863.3s	2863.3	 It's even more true now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2865.0s	2865.0	 He said there was inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2866.3s	2866.3	 Okay, so there was inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2867.4s	2867.4	 Okay, so now, great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2868.7s	2868.7	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2869.2s	2869.2	 Somebody made a prediction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2870.2s	2870.2	 It was proven true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2871.7s	2871.7	 Yeah, I made one in January that said the same thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2873.6s	2873.6	 Now, look, you can do three things to curb inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2879.0s	2879.0	 Raise rates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2879.8s	2879.8	 When you raise interest rates, you slow spending.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2882.8s	2882.8	 Prices come down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2884.0s	2884.0	 Inflation slows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2885.1s	2885.1	 But the issue when you raise rates is, obviously, you see things like job loss and economic growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2890.1s	2890.1	 declines, and it can very quickly spiral the other way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2892.5s	2892.5	 This is the big challenge of Fed tapering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2894.5s	2894.5	 The other option, as we've seen a significant attempt at lately, is to raise revenue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2898.2s	2898.2	 So increase tax rates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2900.9s	2900.9	 Tax a broader swath of people at a higher rate or a broader swath of business at a higher rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2905.0s	2905.0	 So it's very likely that tax revenue could present itself again as a driver if inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2912.3s	2912.3	 continues to spiral up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2913.8s	2913.8	 And the third, which is the least likely, is cut spending.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2916.5s	2916.5	 The federal government spending the way it does right now makes a very inefficient way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2922.4s	2922.4	 of kind of putting capital into the system and inflating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2926.1s	2926.1	 We've seen historically that anything the federal government spends money on, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2929.2s	2929.2	 health care and education, the costs very quickly spiral out of control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2933.0s	2933.0	 Super inefficient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2934.2s	2934.2	 Why not just give that money to the free market to make decisions on how to spend it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2937.5s	2937.5	 It would be more efficient, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2938.7s	2938.7	 And the market would effectively find balance where buyers and sellers are equivalent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2942.8s	2942.8	 as opposed to having the federal government driving the price of everything up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2946.5s	2946.5	 The fourth option that people don't talk about, which I think may end up becoming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2951.7s	2951.7	 an important option, not kind of oblique option, but more kind of backdrop, is to start a war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2958.9s	2958.9	 And when you start a war-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2960.1s	2960.1	 Wag the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2961.2s	2961.2	 Wag the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2962.3s	2962.3	 Yeah. When you start a war, you stimulate the economy without needing to pump additional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2966.7s	2966.7	 capital in so you can increase growth and avoid the risk of stagflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2970.5s	2970.5	 And you can source resources that otherwise wouldn't be kind of flowing in the trade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2975.4s	2975.4	 or basically in a land grab type situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2978.9s	2978.9	 But it doesn't necessarily mean that policymakers would say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2981.3s	2981.3	 hey, let's go start a war to decrease inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2984.2s	2984.2	 Taiwan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2985.7s	2985.7	 But the premise that conflict can improve the economy is an important backdrop that starts to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2993.7s	2993.7	 play into policy decisions that might get made over the next couple of months and quarters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2998.4s	2998.4	 And that's really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=2999.6s	2999.6	 Whether or not the posturing is one of partnership and reducing the tension with foreign nations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3006.3s	3006.3	 or one of increasing the tension, it's more likely that we would want to increase the tension
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3010.5s	3010.5	 when we're in an inflationary environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3013.0s	3013.0	 That's quite a conspiracy there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3014.2s	3014.2	 So what do you think, Sax?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3015.2s	3015.2	 Okay. We got to go back to first principles on this thing. We're not going to start a war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3018.9s	3018.9	 to tame inflation. But let me just explain what inflation is because I'm not sure people fully
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3024.8s	3024.8	 understand how this works. Inflation is very simple. It's too much money chasing too few goods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3031.1s	3031.1	 And we have both sides of the equation going on right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3034.2s	3034.2	 On the supply side, on the goods side, we've got shortages. We've got the ports backed up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3039.8s	3039.8	 We've got paying people not to work. We still have the $2 trillion of COVID relief passed earlier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3045.3s	3045.3	 this year, which was responding to a problem that was largely winding down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3049.3s	3049.3	 So we have these labor shortages. We have people dropping out of the workforce in record numbers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3054.3s	3054.3	 The number that just came out showed more people quitting their jobs than ever before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3058.5s	3058.5	 So we have a shortage in terms of the production of goods and services that people want. At the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3064.5s	3064.5	 same time, we have this monetary and fiscal expansion coming out of Washington.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3071.4s	3071.4	 Again, they did the $1.9 trillion of COVID relief. They did $1.2 trillion of infrastructure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3076.4s	3076.4	 Biden's still talking about another $2 trillion of social welfare. You have the Fed still printing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3081.6s	3081.6	 money with QE. So you've got this massive expansion in the amount of money. So look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3086.4s	3086.4	 too much money chasing too few goods creates this problem. It was very predictable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3091.9s	3091.9	 And so what I said back in May, this is what I was warning about, and it goes back to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3096.0s	3096.0	 Druckenmiller clip that we were talking about all the way back in May. He said the same thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3100.5s	3100.5	 that we had a reckless fiscal and monetary expansionary policy coming out of Washington.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3105.8s	3105.8	 At a time, we didn't need it because if you looked at retail spending back in May,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3109.7s	3109.7	 it was back to above trend. In other words, there was no demand problem. The economy was back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3116.5s	3116.5	 They've just been pumping and pumping out of Washington.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3119.3s	3119.3	 We made a we had a we had good intent. We wanted to make people not suffer. We wanted to get the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3123.3s	3123.3	 economy on top. We may have just made a bigger bet than we needed to. We overdid it. We overdid it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3128.7s	3128.7	 clearly. Look, who wants to be the politician, quite frankly, who ends the eviction moratorium,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3136.4s	3136.4	 right? The gravy trend. Yeah, nobody. Well, nobody wants to be the politician who says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3140.4s	3140.4	 okay, now you suddenly have to pay your rent. But obviously, people have to pay their rent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3144.4s	3144.4	 We're taking away your bonus unemployment. People have to go back to work at some point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3149.0s	3149.0	 when there's 10 million jobs open, just as a I've been watching the Taiwan situation like a hawk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3156.0s	3156.0	 And I don't know if you saw this this week to go off on another tangent, but the US is testing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3160.1s	3160.1	 Israelis Iron Dome and Guam as a defense against Chinese cruise missiles. Obviously,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3168.9s	3168.9	 for possible deployment in Taiwan. And I don't know if you're watching NS Canter in the end,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3175.3s	3175.3	 but he has been going on CNN and stuff like that now talking about China. Pretty amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3182.1s	3182.1	 I predict escalating global conflict. That'll be my prediction to mark the Q4.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3187.6s	3187.6	 Well, I think that's I think actually, that's a pretty valid prediction. But I just think it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3192.5s	3192.5	 a little bit separate than inflation. Like I said, it's not an explicit decision. But I do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3197.2s	3197.2	 think that in the backdrop of an inflationary environment, where you have something that can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3200.4s	3200.4	 temper the condition at home, that at the same time, you know, might sell politically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3205.6s	3205.6	 But we don't need it. It's not going to solve anything politically. Okay. I mean, World War II,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3209.8s	3209.8	 you know, famously got us out of the Great Depression because that did stimulate demand. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3214.1s	3214.1	 the situation we're in today, we have too much demand, we have retail is trending way above
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3219.2s	3219.2	 curve, we have as a supply shortage, and devoting resources, taking them away from the productive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3224.1s	3224.1	 economy to go to war would only exacerbate the problem and make it even worse. What we need right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3228.9s	3228.9	 now actually is for Washington to back off to stop pumping demand with this with you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3235.8s	3235.8	 now they're still talking about this machine, so the money printing, that's what we need,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3239.4s	3239.4	 we need them to get out of the way and to stop these disincentives for production and work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3246.0s	3246.0	 So you have me, I mean, mansion was exactly right about this. Okay. Do you remember when mansion,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3250.6s	3250.6	 when he was resisting this $2 trillion social welfare bill, I mean, the things he said are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3256.2s	3256.2	 already coming true. I mean, he said this months ago, he said that we should take a strategic pause
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3262.1s	3262.1	 because he said, this is a quote, by all accounts, the threat posed by record inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3266.6s	3266.6	 to the American people is not transitory, and is instead getting worse from the grocery store to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3271.8s	3271.8	 the gas pump Americans know that the inflation tax is real. And DC can no longer ignore the economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3277.2s	3277.2	 pain Americans feel every day. That's what he was saying this past summer several months ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3282.1s	3282.1	 and they rolled right over him. The psychology of this could be could be self fulfilling as well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3287.0s	3287.0	 because what's going to happen is, you're going to have everybody raise prices, because it's now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3291.3s	3291.3	 become an escalation, you know, your hairdresser, your, you know, whatever, you know, services,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3296.9s	3296.9	 you're using whatever product you're buying, whatever restaurant you're going to is going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3300.1s	3300.1	 to put $2 on every appetizer and five bucks on every entree, everything is just going to keep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3303.7s	3303.7	 going up. And then what happens is, people who are in the middle class, or, you know, who are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3309.1s	3309.1	 consumers of products in a large way, we'll say, you know, I'm going to put off buying a car,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3312.9s	3312.9	 then we're going to be driving all this supply up. And then people are going to say, you know what,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3316.5s	3316.5	 fuck it, I'll just drive this one for two more years, that's going to cause stagnation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3322.8s	3322.8	 It's what we had in the 1970s. And you're right, it's called an inflationary spiral,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3326.2s	3326.2	 which is the future expectations of increasing prices means that people start increasing them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3331.4s	3331.4	 now. And that feeds on itself. Yeah. And that's what we had in the late 1970s. And the thing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3336.3s	3336.3	 broke that was Paul Volcker jacking up interest rates. It was very painful, cause a very severe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3340.9s	3340.9	 recession in the early 1980s. But then the economy came roaring out of that by 83, it got Reagan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3346.9s	3346.9	 elected in 84. And you had 30 straight years of declining interest rates. And that led to a stock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3352.5s	3352.5	 market boom. So the problem we have now, okay, here's the problem we have is there's going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3357.3s	3357.3	 be no Paul Volcker. Why? We can't afford to jack up rates, because the federal government's debt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3362.9s	3362.9	 is so much bigger than it used to be. We are not on a fixed rate. We're on a variable rate. All of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3367.3s	3367.3	 the debt we take. The average maturity of government debt right now is five years. Okay. So that means
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3372.9s	3372.9	 the whole debt rolls over within five years. So if they jack up interest rates, we have almost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3377.3s	3377.3	 30 trillion of US federal debt right now. So every 1% that they increase interest rates,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3383.7s	3383.7	 that means another 300 billion a year of debt service agreements. Exactly. So there's going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3391.0s	3391.0	 be enormous pressure on the Fed not to raise rates. You already are hearing Biden rattling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3397.1s	3397.1	 the sabers saying that Powell may not be his choice for a second term. By the way, Powell is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3401.9s	3401.9	 very dovish. He's basically saying, we can't raise rates right now because of this and that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3406.2s	3406.2	 So, and the Biden administration, nobody in Washington ever wants rates to go up, right? They
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3411.8s	3411.8	 want to keep these low rates forever. This is the problem is, look, at the end of the day, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3416.0s	3416.0	 know what the inflation picture is going to look like next year. But what concerns me is we don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3421.3s	3421.3	 have effective tools to fight it anymore because we've given up our ability to raise rates because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3425.6s	3425.6	 it would increase the cost of the debt so much. And I mean, so just one article just to share with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3431.5s	3431.5	 you guys is this, again, one of my favorite sources of economic information is the Fred
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3436.7s	3436.7	 blog, which is from the St. Louis Fed. Okay. They wrote a blog talking about two tales of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3442.7s	3442.7	 federal debt. Okay. And the article is about, here's why there's so much disagreement on whether
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3447.3s	3447.3	 the federal government debt is too high. So the first chart shows debt to GDP. This was always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3451.5s	3451.5	 the way of looking at government debt was simply looking at the ratio of debt to GDP. It's now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3456.5s	3456.5	 something like 125% in peacetime. I don't think we've had a higher peacetime ratio. That would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3462.0s	3462.0	 tell you things were out of control. But for the last decade, while this has been going on, you had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3465.9s	3465.9	 this whole school of thought, the MMT, modern monetary theory, all these economists and experts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3471.1s	3471.1	 and politicians in the media were eager to buy in because they want to spend the money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3475.0s	3475.0	 Okay. And what they said is, no, it's not debt to GDP. You should look at debt service to GDP.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3480.1s	3480.1	 This is the second chart on that blog. And so debt service to GDP was staying constant or even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3486.9s	3486.9	 going down as the debt to GDP was going up. Why? Because interest rates were so low. The problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3492.6s	3492.6	 is, well, what's so foolish about this point of view is it is assumed that interest rates were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3497.0s	3497.0	 going to last forever. Well, if that was your point of view, why didn't you do what Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3501.4s	3501.4	 actually suggested several years ago when he suggested having a hundred year T-bills,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3504.6s	3504.6	 they should have walked in much, much longer duration, maturities on the federal debt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3510.7s	3510.7	 And instead, and Yellen rejected this. Okay. And so you've got a five year average duration,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3516.2s	3516.2	 which means that if interest rates go back up, the debt service cost is going to explode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3521.7s	3521.7	 Yeah. In 1980, we changed the goalposts for CPI. So even as a measurement to know what we look at,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3528.1s	3528.1	 and I think Jack Dorsey tweeted this out. So Nick, you may be able to find this tweet, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3533.2s	3533.2	 we changed the measurement of how CPI measures. And so if you go back to the original measurement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3538.9s	3538.9	 it looks like inflation and CPI is much more pernicious than we would otherwise think if we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3544.8s	3544.8	 just look at the new CPI that we that we started to look at as of 1980. So that's another sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3551.3s	3551.3	 like point we did this. We did the same thing with I just go back to what I said early on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3556.2s	3556.2	 had given up looking to the smartest people that we both know are net sellers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3562.5s	3562.5	 Well, they're selling some. Yeah. I mean, I'm just saying the two smartest people we know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3567.9s	3567.9	 I mean, we don't want to get financial advice here. But should everybody be moving to cash?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3572.1s	3572.1	 No, where do you put your money? I'm just totally confused. This is I think the admission just by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3578.0s	3578.0	 productive assets, great businesses that have durability, and let them ride for 20 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3584.3s	3584.3	 I like your answer. The fact is, we're all confounded as to what to do at this moment in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3589.2s	3589.2	 time. We're all trying to figure this out. And we do this for a living. But then you're trading the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3592.8s	3592.8	 market like everyone else all the time. Like, you know, why trade the market when you can just buy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3596.2s	3596.2	 great businesses own stakes in them, and let it rest. I mean, my practical issue is that I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3603.3s	3603.3	 have infinite money. And so in order to put my money into productive assets, I have to sell other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3607.5s	3607.5	 productive assets. Well, you've got other productive assets, leave them in. Why sell? Well, then it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3613.7s	3613.7	 like then I'm basically, you know, doubling down on a worldview that may be old and dated, right? So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3618.8s	3618.8	 if I'm long a bunch of software companies, and I really want to do something in climate science or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3622.2s	3622.2	 biotech, what am I supposed to do? Don't try don't try and time the market shift your assets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3626.4s	3626.4	 right? Why do you care what the no, no, I'm not trying to try. I'm not trying, trying to time the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3630.1s	3630.1	 market. I'm just saying if, if my worldview shifts to really want to double down on climate science
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3634.4s	3634.4	 or alternative finance or biotech, I have to raise capital to do that. You have to raise capital to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3640.2s	3640.2	 your site. Right. But but for me, I'm not raising it from other people. I'm raising it for myself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3644.4s	3644.4	 So it seems like to me, the best place to be right now is in the company formation space,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3652.6s	3652.6	 because when you create a company, like Friedberg does every three months, there is so much value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3659.7s	3659.7	 being created that moment in time and so much further capital getting poured into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3664.1s	3664.1	 But if you are the originator of the company, and you get some big slice of the cap table for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3668.6s	3668.6	 doing that, which is completely valid, you originated the company, whether it's Munich or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3672.6s	3672.6	 call in or whatever it is, man, that is a great moment of creation of wealth creation. And when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3678.5s	3678.5	 you're the person putting the money in at the billion dollar valuation for the company,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3681.9s	3681.9	 whatever call in, I'm sorry, clubhouse, went from 100 million to 4 billion with no revenue. I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3688.8s	3688.8	 know what's happening in the world, but pretty crazy. Do you want to go on to Xi Jinping and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3695.3s	3695.3	 his is gonna be speaking with Biden on Monday. It's done. He got it done before his his video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3701.1s	3701.1	 zoom with Biden. Oh, yeah. So they're doing that. Now the supreme leader hasn't left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3706.7s	3706.7	 Now the supreme leader. Explain what this means. Chum off from the story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3711.0s	3711.0	 I mean, I think the basic the basic takeaway is that they've been working inside the body politic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3715.4s	3715.4	 inside of China, to basically reflect Xi on the same level as Mao and, and effectively, what this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3722.1s	3722.1	 means is that it allows him to remain the leader of China indefinitely. And so there is no transition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3732.1s	3732.1	 of power. Typically, what had happened was these there were these 10 year windows and you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3737.1s	3737.1	 you you go, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, you know, 10 year cycles, and then they pass the baton.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3743.8s	3743.8	 But it now looks like we'll be living with Xi Jinping until until you know, he he joins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3749.3s	3749.3	 the afterworld. So he's ruler for life of China, basically crazy. I don't think that's exactly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3755.7s	3755.7	 right. What an incredible feat of political maneuvering without judging it just to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3762.9s	3762.9	 how what a complicated Byzantine political infrastructure he must have had to navigate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3767.0s	3767.0	 I don't know how he played the three dimensional chess with all these people, the slow systematic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3771.8s	3771.8	 dismantling of the old guard, placing all of his people in and slowly moving towards this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3777.7s	3777.7	 this kind of recognition. He's not a little bit admiring Chumas. Yeah, no, the dictator got his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3782.9s	3782.9	 name for a reason. Somewhere. Donald Trump and Steve Bannon are like, what did we do wrong? We
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3788.3s	3788.3	 were so close January six, we almost if Pence would have just played ball, sacks, you'd still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3794.2s	3794.2	 be in power. Huh? Your guys dropped the ball. And we wouldn't have inflationary. Just think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3801.7s	3801.7	 you know, Jason, given how accurate my predictions have been, you should have a little bit more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3805.9s	3805.9	 respect for my political positions. What do you guys think happens now that G basically is ruler
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3812.6s	3812.6	 for life? You know, he I think the Chinese term for it is historic figure, which is that's what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3818.2s	3818.2	 our lines of saying, you know, you're, you're basically, you're a made man, basically, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3823.3s	3823.3	 can't get whacked, nobody can touch you, you're good for life. The end, nobody can question you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3828.9s	3828.9	 I mean, can you imagine Mao Zedong, that, you know, Deng Xiaoping, and how Xi Jinping incredible,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3834.5s	3834.5	 like he is at that level? Well, it means if you start a war, and a serious military conflict that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3841.3s	3841.3	 nobody can question you, right, you're the supreme leader. So it's sort of like Putin and MBS, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3847.0s	3847.0	 MBS can go kill a journalist, and he's got nobody to answer to means he has nobody to answer to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3853.3s	3853.3	 Mao Zedong initiated the revolution. And, you know, Deng Xiaoping was really the architect of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3859.4s	3859.4	 free markets that has made China the economic powerhouse that it is today. Their internal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3865.6s	3865.6	 reflection is Xi Jinping is on the same scale of that. Now, I mean, I can't claim to know enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3870.4s	3870.4	 for the future. Yeah, what is the accomplishment that's going to really put him in that league,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3874.5s	3874.5	 and you'd have to say it's the annexation of Taiwan. I mean, that's the thing that he must
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3879.7s	3879.7	 be looking to do before, you know, his time to reunify China, that's the thing that could put him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3886.0s	3886.0	 in that league. And so that that is the tripwire that to freeberg's point that could lead to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3893.9s	3893.9	 you know, a conflict, I think they, you know, I hate to say that freeberg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3897.3s	3897.3	 is wrong. Because I don't think in this case, I can, I do think that there is some left tail risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3904.5s	3904.5	 for like a crazy wag the dog moment in Taiwan, it would be really scary. Really scary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3910.1s	3910.1	 Right now, if I was looking at the sizes of the Navy, as people don't know this, Japan actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3914.4s	3914.4	 has a very large defensive Navy, the UK and the United States obviously have very large ones,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3920.9s	3920.9	 China's is large, but not on a tonnage basis, they have a lot of ships. But together, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3926.3s	3926.3	 know if you saw the military exercises going on, but New Zealand, Australia, the United States, UK
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3932.5s	3932.5	 and Japan were basically I think, South Korea would were basically driving their ships around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3938.4s	3938.4	 the South China Sea. This is going to be, I think, you know, I did, I did a really interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3943.3s	3943.3	 interview with the historian and commentator, Neil Ferguson, who is also a pretty avid China watcher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3950.8s	3950.8	 And I did an interview with him actually on on my app. You don't want me to say the name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3958.2s	3958.2	 But anyway, so he hit a really great line, which is he said that the that the issue of Taiwan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3964.7s	3964.7	 it's basically like the issue of Cuba and Berlin and the Persian Gulf all rolled into one. So it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3974.4s	3974.4	 like Cuba and the Cuban Missile Crisis, because it's right there off the shore of China. It's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3979.5s	3979.5	 Berlin, you know, because that was basically the dividing line between freedom and, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3986.2s	3986.2	 totalitarianism, you know, where the where the Berlin Wall got built. And it's like the Persian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3991.3s	3991.3	 Gulf, because the new oil are the semiconductors, the chips that are fabbed in Taiwan, TSMC. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=3998.2s	3998.2	 all the resources that we're dependent on for the new economy are all right there. So super
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4003.9s	4003.9	 smart framing. Yeah, it's I thought it was a cover line. The thing we have to remember about Xi is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4008.8s	4008.8	 that his father was was a commander for Mao and was in a vice premier. And so you know, his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4016.2s	4016.2	 historical he is the original princeling, right? Remember, you know, there's this context of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4020.6s	4020.6	 Chinese princelings. But he is he is one of these originalists. And so his motivation will be,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4027.3s	4027.3	 it seems at least, to bring China back into that spectrum of power, which is really about a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4035.2s	4035.2	 consolidated country, and a single nation state, and that has to include Taiwan, it can't it can't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4040.6s	4040.6	 not. So to your point, David, it's almost more motivation for him to go off on some crazy adventure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4045.3s	4045.3	 and try to reclaim it. That's gonna be crazy. It's really interesting to look at the tonnage of ships
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4052.0s	4052.0	 and the number of ships, the United States has over 6000 tons of ships 949, according to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4057.0s	4057.0	 global security.org, China has to only 2000 tons and 1000 ships have a lot of smaller ships.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4062.8s	4062.8	 And then Russia, UK, India, Japan, France, Indonesia, Turkey, Germany, Italy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4066.4s	4066.4	 is a warship, Jason, or? Yeah, this is their their Navy warships. And so they're fighting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4072.0s	4072.0	 But Japan has a very large one. I wasn't aware of this, because I thought they were not doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4076.2s	4076.2	 military buildup, but they have what's called a defensive Navy, which can do offensive stuff. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4081.0s	4081.0	 this is, I think this is really problematic. How many ships are smaller than Saxe's yacht that he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4086.5s	4086.5	 rented this? Yeah, Saxe's tonnage would kind of put the United States over the top, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4092.1s	4092.1	 in the gross tonnage of Saxe's yacht is going to be donating his new shirt. No, for sure. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4097.2s	4097.2	 bigger than Indonesia. I see Indonesia on this list. Turkey. I mean, how big in my defense,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4102.5s	4102.5	 it was a starter yacht. My indefensible next one. Next one will be bigger. Yeah, Solana is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4110.4s	4110.4	 going to make sure of that. Right? Yeah, you can buy yachts with Solana. All right. I think we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4113.9s	4113.9	 covered enough. GE and Toshiba can't run their businesses, though they're each separating into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4118.5s	4118.5	 three separate companies. Let's talk about that. That's interesting, actually. And Johnson & Johnson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4122.3s	4122.3	 Yeah, we should talk about it today. All right. So on Tuesday, GE announced they were splitting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4125.9s	4125.9	 into three separate companies, Aviation, Healthcare and Energy. Toshiba reported a similar plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4131.8s	4131.8	 Johnson & Johnson today. Johnson & Johnson was today. This is in direct conflict with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4138.5s	4138.5	 consolidation and the creation of conglomerates and- But not conglomerates. I think this is an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4143.4s	4143.4	 important point, J Cal. In the 80s and 90s, it was cool to create conglomerates, meaning you would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4149.3s	4149.3	 stick businesses together that were- RJR, yeah. Somewhat disparate because you could financially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4154.7s	4154.7	 engineer a way to do it that would juice shareholder returns. You could borrow money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4159.7s	4159.7	 add lots of scale, the cost of debt goes down, you could increase your debt load, etc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4164.9s	4164.9	 And the challenge is when you're scaling a business, you either need to grow your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4169.2s	4169.2	 revenue organically or you need to acquire. And when you're acquiring, you're either acquiring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4174.0s	4174.0	 horizontally or you're acquiring vertically, meaning you're integrating your supply chain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4178.5s	4178.5	 or you're adding ancillary businesses that you can cross-sell. So you're either reducing your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4183.7s	4183.7	 costs or increasing your cross-selling ability. So there's some inherent synergy in the acquisition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4188.5s	4188.5	 The problem with conglomerates is there is very little synergy, meaning when you acquire a new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4193.1s	4193.1	 business, like an aviation business, it doesn't create synergy for your healthcare business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4197.2s	4197.2	 And there was always a rationalization that these managers of these big conglomerates had,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4201.9s	4201.9	 which was like, oh, well, we could do this and we could do that. At the end of the day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4204.5s	4204.5	 it was financial engineering, where they simply kind of use debt to reduce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4209.7s	4209.7	 the cost of capital and increase the shareholder returns. And now everyone's kind of waking up to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4214.9s	4214.9	 the fact that you're actually decreasing value because an investor that wants to own an aviation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4220.1s	4220.1	 company doesn't also want to own a healthcare company, so the investor doesn't buy those shares.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4223.7s	4223.7	 And the investor that wants to own the healthcare company doesn't want to own the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4225.8s	4225.8	 aviation company, so they don't buy those shares. So the way to increase shareholder value is to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4229.5s	4229.5	 actually split those businesses up, and then the investors that want to own the aviation business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4233.7s	4233.7	 will pay more and the investors that want to own the healthcare business will pay more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4236.7s	4236.7	 And the overall value of those two businesses goes up by having them be separate. And that's what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4241.7s	4241.7	 market's kind of waking up to. And this is kind of a trend that's been going on for years now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4245.8s	4245.8	 going back to kind of 2013, 14, where the market started to kind of rationalize some of these silly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4252.1s	4252.1	 conglomerate business ideas and break them apart into more kind of targeted businesses that can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4257.5s	4257.5	 actually spin out or break off breakups that can basically attract shareholders to bid on each one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4264.7s	4264.7	 of those businesses individually and drive value up. One business I was close to that I saw this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4269.8s	4269.8	 with was Dow DuPont, where they down merged with DuPont and then they split into several businesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4275.3s	4275.3	 that each were focused on a particular vertical. And it made a lot of sense to drive value for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4280.6s	4280.6	 the overall shareholders. So at the end of the day, these conglomerates are about kind of driving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4285.7s	4285.7	 economic outcomes. And the only folks that you see doing this well are folks like Warren Buffett,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4290.4s	4290.4	 where the job is really about capital allocation, where you can allocate capital to the best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4295.7s	4295.7	 business and that business on its own will grow organically versus taking a bunch of crappy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4300.7s	4300.7	 low growth, no growth businesses, levering them up to kind of juice the returns on each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4305.5s	4305.5	 And we're seeing this slow unwinding happening. So I think it'll continue to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4308.9s	4308.9	 and you could probably go and pick a bunch of these conglomerates and you'll see the activist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4312.1s	4312.1	 shareholders doing this. They'll buy a bunch of shares, they'll instigate and say, hey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4316.3s	4316.3	 you guys should break up the share price will go up by 2030%. So if you want to start for the day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4321.5s	4321.5	 you know, go find a set of conglomerates that are going to get attacked and broken up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4324.7s	4324.7	 It's interesting Chamathia and you know, with public markets, Dell is spinning out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4330.8s	4330.8	 VMware and that's going to create a massive amount of cash and shareholder value, they're doing a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4336.7s	4336.7	 huge dividend. So I guess my question to you Chamath is, when do we start to see this hit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4342.9s	4342.9	 not from a point of weakness, but from companies that are strong and see this as, hey, this is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4348.1s	4348.1	 way to just unlock shareholder value, will we see an Amazon spin out AWS, a YouTube or an Instagram
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4355.4s	4355.4	 come out of their parent companies? I think it's very rare that these things happen on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4359.9s	4359.9	 the offensive foot. I think it's typically a defensive maneuver that's driven by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4364.7s	4364.7	 really poor returns over long periods of time, or activist investors who want to push for value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4370.1s	4370.1	 So you're back against the wall. Totally. I was about to bring that up. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4375.4s	4375.4	 do you remember how hard that eBay, remember like John Donahoe was the CEO, he like fought that so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4381.3s	4381.3	 hard. I remember getting a phone call from him asking if I would support them. He had rounded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4386.3s	4386.3	 up read off and other people support eBay. I'm like, no, I can't support. Wait, wait, wait, no,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4390.1s	4390.1	 do you remember this? We were in Vegas and Donahoe called and we were working on a plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4394.3s	4394.3	 And then you went and walked on through the plan. Do you remember this thing? We were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4399.5s	4399.5	 what happened? We were in Vegas. We were going to try to do a spin out of I can't, I can't know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4405.2s	4405.2	 no, Donahoe either called you or called me and I said, you should talk to Sachs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4410.2s	4410.2	 We sketched out a plan for what PayPal should do. And oh, yeah, yeah, I do remember that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4415.8s	4415.8	 Saturday afternoon, we sketched out this plan. Yeah, so I told John, no, I'm sorry,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4420.7s	4420.7	 I can't support you because I believe it should be spun out. And so in the only two, the only two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4425.3s	4425.3	 people from the original PayPal team, who said that publicly were me and Elon. And we said that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4430.9s	4430.9	 if you could get PayPal out from under, you know, this, you know, this sort of eBay bureaucracy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4437.2s	4437.2	 it could be $100 billion plus company. The bar for acquisitions is extremely high. Like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4441.6s	4441.6	 I think the last really two acquisitions that were really done well was zucks acquisition of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4446.8s	4446.8	 WhatsApp and Instagram. But since then, the bar is extremely high for these conglomerates. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4450.9s	4450.9	 as an example, PayPal was rumored to be buying Pinterest. And, you know, there was such an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4458.0s	4458.0	 incredible shareholder revolt that they had to put out a press release saying we have absolutely no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4462.1s	4462.1	 interest in acquiring Pinterest. But what that all that did was just, you know, accelerate the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4468.1s	4468.1	 bleeding because then people were saying, wait a minute, how strategically lost must you be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4473.7s	4473.7	 that you would want to buy Pinterest as and so then it then has a result that the PayPal stock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4478.5s	4478.5	 price has gotten absolutely completely a company and it lost the entire value of Pinterest, basically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4485.3s	4485.3	 Here's the big issue that I think we have in American
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4489.4s	4489.4	 economics and company building. You know, we've gone through 20 or 30 years of really under
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4494.4s	4494.4	 investing in R&D at the sake of share buybacks, at the sake of, you know, market consolidation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4503.3s	4503.3	 dividends, private equity, you know, driven take privates. And so all of this capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4510.3s	4510.3	 misallocation has really put us on the wrong foot and the pandemic basically showed that we were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4515.1s	4515.1	 really ill positioned. So a lot of these conglomerates, it doesn't make sense that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4520.1s	4520.1	 it because we've proven that the compensation schemes for CEOs, the incentives for executive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4526.7s	4526.7	 management are way too perverted. And they just create horrible outcomes. A different example I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4534.6s	4534.6	 saw in the last I think 15 or 20 years, IBM's market cap has gone down to 113 billion. In the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4543.1s	4543.1	 meantime, they've bought back $132 billion of stock. What could you imagine the kind of R&D
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4549.4s	4549.4	 that IBM could have affected with that 132 billion and where they could be? So we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4556.5s	4556.5	 They're not they're not good capital allocators. Well, we have horrible capital misallocation. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4561.3s	4561.3	 Well, look at Apple. I mean, I don't think they're not spending money on R&D.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4564.5s	4564.5	 Yeah, they're not. They're not good at it. That's not good at it. They're better off. They're better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4568.1s	4568.1	 off taking those massive. They're better off taking those massive R&D budgets and putting it into M&A
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4573.3s	4573.3	 budgets, not for like a $50 billion Pinterest acquisition that doesn't make any sense has no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4578.3s	4578.3	 synergies, but on smaller acquisitions of teams that have built really interesting technology,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4582.7s	4582.7	 IBM could have bought a lot of different things. They don't seem to know how to innovate or operate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4586.7s	4586.7	 Those guys don't seem to know how to do anything. So like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4590.4s	4590.4	 my point is now we're in the cycle where these conglomerates will get ripped apart so that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4595.6s	4595.6	 a brighter, fresher, and probably younger group of executive management can take a different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4604.0s	4604.0	 spin on these companies and actually do some so for example, like the J&J spin out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4608.4s	4608.4	 is really exciting because you take med devices in pharma and you separate it from a really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4612.5s	4612.5	 struggling, complicated consumer goods, you know, package business, you know, the shampoo,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4616.8s	4616.8	 the q tips, the Listerine, get all that off balance sheet, now you can actually, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4621.3s	4621.3	 make drugs and med devices. And that's a really interesting business at the right CEO can really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4625.3s	4625.3	 do a lot of interesting things with I heard an interview with us, then see of GE, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4629.5s	4629.5	 Colp, who was putting forward this plan, the line that I remember that kind of resonated with me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4634.3s	4634.3	 he said, the benefits of focus are immediate, the benefits of synergy is our hypothetical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4640.9s	4640.9	 And I think that's really the key point here. And that's what's going to fuel all this sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4645.3s	4645.3	 deconglomeration is that the benefits of focus to a company are so huge that, you know, that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4652.5s	4652.5	 but the reason why it doesn't happen is because of this instinct that all these managers have for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4657.7s	4657.7	 empire building rights when times are good, they can keep building their empires and then something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4662.7s	4662.7	 bad has to happen to force them to focus. And by the way, the motivation, they're not they're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4669.9s	4669.9	 owners, they're typically not founders. And so what you end up seeing is their comp goes up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4674.3s	4674.3	 linearly with market cap. So the right exactly. Right. And this is just a just a close to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4679.8s	4679.8	 thought out on that whole eBay PayPal thing. I mean, it was so obvious that eBay should spin out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4684.9s	4684.9	 PayPal, but the management, the management resisted it. And it took an activist shareholder,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4690.5s	4690.5	 I think icon came in there. It was icon who came in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4693.8s	4693.8	 And it's in the lobby, you're fucked. Well, but icon shouldn't have to come in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4698.6s	4698.6	 The reason why there's opportunities, the managers want to do the right thing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4705.7s	4705.7	 done that for 40 or 50 billion. Now it's worth five times that amount support a trillion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4710.3s	4710.3	 It's crazy. And just to put this all in perspective, the stock buybacks that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4714.5s	4714.5	 going on right now, Apple did almost $20 billion less square, they've done 77 billion last year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4719.4s	4719.4	 you want to talk about the impact of tax policy on innovation? Well, you've got on one hand here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4725.6s	4725.6	 Apple is looking at, well, I'm gonna have to pay all these taxes, I might as well just increase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4730.3s	4730.3	 the amount on buying back and be neutral. Why would I want to show any kind of a profit here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4734.6s	4734.6	 I'll just buy back as many shares possible, the company will eventually be private. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4739.5s	4739.5	 this is you got to be really careful with how you do this, because there's no incentive for people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4744.2s	4744.2	 now to put money into R&D or other stuff that just buy back the stock might be the most efficient
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4748.3s	4748.3	 thing to do correct, in terms of like the share. If you don't know how to spend the money, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4751.7s	4751.7	 the dumbest thing to do. It basically shows you're an idiot. Well, it shows you got nothing better to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4755.6s	4755.6	 spend the money on. So maybe maybe maybe that's maybe buying back the stocks better than throwing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4760.0s	4760.0	 it away. But yeah, it means you're out of ideas. It means you're out of ideas, or you or a combination
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4765.9s	4765.9	 of my god, this core business is throwing off so much money that we can't come up with enough ideas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4772.0s	4772.0	 At that time, I think that's no, it just means you're not ambitious enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4775.0s	4775.0	 I mean, what would you spend 20 billion on? I mean, Zuck is having a hard time spending 10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4779.1s	4779.1	 billion on creating the metaverse a year. I mean, you're talking about 80 billion a year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4784.0s	4784.0	 what would you put that towards? What should Apple put it towards?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4787.8s	4787.8	 No, Apple, Apple could even more aggressively double down to enter the car market, they could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4792.1s	4792.1	 have done it fair much sooner than they have. They could spend 20 a year on that. Sure, you're right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4796.2s	4796.2	 you know, easily. They could actually enter. I don't know, power, they could.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4801.7s	4801.7	 Yeah, I mean, but they're, you know, Apple, their, their culture is to have very few products as a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4806.9s	4806.9	 company. They're always very proud of that. It's the Steve Jobs focus thing. I mean, I think it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4810.0s	4810.0	 worked pretty well for them. I know you're second guessing it. The thing that I hear,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4814.1s	4814.1	 I just don't like buybacks, because I think it comes at the sake of R&D. For most companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4819.0s	4819.0	 I think choice companies are different, but everybody else what you see is R&D is like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4824.5s	4824.5	 one or 2% of their, you know, it's a shame. Look, Apple could definitely be more aggressive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4830.3s	4830.3	 but I wouldn't judge the Tim Cook era until we see what happens with glasses,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4833.5s	4833.5	 because this is the product that I hear is coming is going to be their, you know, their AR glasses,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4839.1s	4839.1	 and that's gonna be a new computing platform that they open up to developers. And I guess Cook's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4843.7s	4843.7	 been there for what a decade, but I think he doesn't want to retire until this comes out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4848.4s	4848.4	 And he can see this is going to be his signature product, I think. But I'll tell you just the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4852.9s	4852.9	 thought that this went through my head as I saw this news about GE, it really was kind of the end
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4856.5s	4856.5	 of an era. You got to remember that back in the 80s 90s, I think even as late as 2000, GE was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4861.2s	4861.2	 number one company in America by market cap, it was the top of the S&P 500. It later subsequently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4866.5s	4866.5	 got kicked out of the, the Dow Jones. But the thing that went through my head is, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4870.6s	4870.6	 when I was a kid growing up, the only two business names that I even knew were Jack Welsh and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4877.0s	4877.0	 Lee Iacocca, you know, that was it. That was it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4879.0s	4879.0	 He had their posters on the wall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4881.1s	4881.1	 GE and Chrysler.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4882.1s	4882.1	 Farrah Fawcett in between the two of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4884.0s	4884.0	 It was big Jack Welsh and Iacocca. And now you don't even know the name of the GE guy. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4889.2s	4889.2	 like I know it because I watched some interview and I saw him up there. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4892.3s	4892.3	 I mean, you can't think of a business leader today who's not in tech and really a tech founder or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4899.1s	4899.1	 somebody who's handed the ball by the tech founder. So we know Tim Cook because Steve Jobs handed him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4904.4s	4904.4	 the ball, but otherwise it's all tech, all tech founders. You don't hear about any of these old,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4909.3s	4909.3	 like Dow Jones type companies anymore. It's just the business, the business environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4916.1s	4916.1	 the economy has changed so much since the 80s and 90s. It's all totally dominated by tech now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4922.0s	4922.0	 But Sachs, I would argue that the disruptive business and the disruptive business leader
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4926.2s	4926.2	 are always the icons. Back in the day, the chemical companies were the icons and everyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4930.9s	4930.9	 knew the chemical companies and the guys running them. Then it was the industrial companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4934.4s	4934.4	 then it was kind of the financial, then it were these guys in the 80s and 90s that did all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4938.7s	4938.7	 LBOs. Iacocca weren't founders, you know, but they were in different ways. Tell me the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4943.8s	4943.8	 companies on R&D spending. Top two companies without looking on R&D spending. In the world?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4948.3s	4948.3	 Yeah, global. In the world. Number one, number two. Give me number one, number two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4953.9s	4953.9	 No, it depends on classification, but I would say Saudi or Ramco.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4957.8s	4957.8	 Freebird, what do you got? Yeah, I would probably put Exxon up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4962.1s	4962.1	 You guys need to think about who was been some of the most innovative leaders, Amazon 42 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4968.1s	4968.1	 in 2020. But Jason, that's an accounting thing. If you're saying in the world,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4972.1s	4972.1	 Saudi or Ramco, their exploration, their E&P budget is probably $200 billion a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4977.0s	4977.0	 Okay, I guess maybe because that's not that's a that's is that a corporate entity? Technically,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4982.7s	4982.7	 wouldn't be on the list of public company. Yeah. So Google's gotta be spending 25 billion with 27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4988.3s	4988.3	 billion. Oh, off by two. Huawei is third 22. Microsoft is fourth 19. No, this is all companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=4997.1s	4997.1	 Samsung, Facebook. Some of this is just accounting categorization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=5001.9s	5001.9	 Because the engineering budget is is basically what goes into R&D. So the more engineers you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=5007.4s	5007.4	 have on staff, the bigger your R&D budget doesn't mean you're producing anything, by the way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=5010.8s	5010.8	 bigger industrial companies, traditional companies that list things as R&D. You know, most of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=5016.1s	5016.1	 dollars flow out to third party companies like enterprise software companies, services businesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=5021.4s	5021.4	 So it doesn't end up gets accounted for, it's quote unquote R&D because they get to capitalize it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=5026.4s	5026.4	 But that spend is typically not paying in house salaries to engineers. And that's the distinction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=5033.4s	5033.4	 between true tech companies and other companies that are quote unquote going through digital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=5038.1s	5038.1	 transformation, or, you know, have a quote unquote R&D budget, they're outsourcing R&D,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=5043.9s	5043.9	 and typically paying three times as much and typically getting one 10th in the return.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=5048.2s	5048.2	 And I think that's the maybe a good heuristic for how you might kind of want to look at what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=5051.8s	5051.8	 differentiates a tech, a true tech company, depending on counting Saudi Aramco spends 37

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODfsBMGzGQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=80&t=5346.6s	5346.6	 did was we calculated what Bezos is investment track record was right, because he basically
