https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=65.6s	65.6	 Obviously, I don't like to talk about a certain friend of mine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=67.7s	67.7	 because he's very high profile.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=69.3s	69.3	 And I don't talk about it in public.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=99.8s	99.8	 Arguably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=100.9s	100.9	 I mean, he's got a lot of friends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=102.2s	102.2	 Guys, hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=103.2s	103.2	 Don't you remember the joke at Sax's roast five years ago?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=108.9s	108.9	 Remember when Elon was late and I had that ad lib joke?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=111.7s	111.7	 There were two jokes that I landed at Sax's thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=113.8s	113.8	 which I thought were the two fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=114.5s	114.5	 No, my thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=115.8s	115.8	 No, Jason, my thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=116.9s	116.9	 And I was being roasted?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=119.7s	119.7	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=120.2s	120.2	 Wait, was it Jason's party?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=121.4s	121.4	 Sax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=121.7s	121.7	 Oh, yeah, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=123.3s	123.3	 I hosted Jason's roast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=125.5s	125.5	 That's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=126.1s	126.1	 That's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=126.6s	126.6	 It was your roast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=127.4s	127.4	 It was your roast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=128.1s	128.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=129.1s	129.1	 Anyways, OK, go ahead.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=130.6s	130.6	 Otherwise known as the funniest night of all of our collective lives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=135.4s	135.4	 It was really funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=136.2s	136.2	 That was really funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=137.0s	137.0	 We have to tell stories from that sometime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=139.0s	139.0	 Sometime we'll tell the J Cal roast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=140.7s	140.7	 You probably are Elon's funniest friend and have a talent for writing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=144.5s	144.5	 Let's not beat around the bush.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=145.4s	145.4	 You do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=145.8s	145.8	 Let's not beat around the bush.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=146.6s	146.6	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=147.0s	147.0	 Let's give you credit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=148.1s	148.1	 I'll take the compliment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=149.6s	149.6	 So I left to go on a little trip to go to Austin to see some friends and then Miami
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=153.9s	153.9	 to see some friends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=154.6s	154.6	 One of those friends who I hooked up with and was hanging out with in Miami was obviously Elon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=160.2s	160.2	 And he was doing Saturday Night Live and we were just coming up with ideas around the dinner table
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=167.0s	167.0	 and we were just laughing our asses off, just brainstorming ideas that would never be allowed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=171.6s	171.6	 on television.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=173.4s	173.4	 You know, and he said, hey, would you come with me to Saturday Night Live?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=177.6s	177.6	 And I was like, oh, that's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=178.5s	178.5	 You have enough tickets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=179.3s	179.3	 I assumed he meant Saturday night, you know, and he said, no, I don't have a lot of tickets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=183.3s	183.3	 It's COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=183.8s	183.8	 It's like half his money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=184.8s	184.8	 Would you come with me to the writer's room and just, you know, be my wingman,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=189.2s	189.2	 basically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=189.9s	189.9	 So I had like three or four board meetings with my podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=193.0s	193.0	 So I just, you know, I talked to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=194.6s	194.6	 It was like an instant yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=195.8s	195.8	 You checked your schedule?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=197.9s	197.9	 I was like, you have to check your schedule?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=199.9s	199.9	 I didn't have to check my schedule.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=203.6s	203.6	 No, I mean, I take my work seriously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=206.6s	206.6	 Can you give me about half a second to decide?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=208.2s	208.2	 Well, I already made the decision in my mind that if my friend needs help, you guys have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=212.1s	212.1	 been in similar situations where you've asked me for help.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=214.4s	214.4	 I've rolled with Chamoff on speaking gigs or going down to try to, you know, save
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=219.8s	219.8	 Sachs from going into complete utter madness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=222.0s	222.0	 Oh my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=223.8s	223.8	 This is not crisis management.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=225.2s	225.2	 Anyway, so you said yes, you went.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=226.7s	226.7	 So I said yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=227.7s	227.7	 And, you know, without giving, well, without giving away anything that was private or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=233.5s	233.5	 confidential, they have a process that they've been doing for 46 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=238.8s	238.8	 And we came in, you know, with our own process of what we wanted to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=244.6s	244.6	 And it kind of was, you know, kind of an interesting thing because a lot of the ideas I had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=250.6s	250.6	 were, let's just say, a little too far out for the cast or for the writers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=255.3s	255.3	 But some of them landed and.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=259.3s	259.3	 I got to spend a lot of time with Lauren Michaels.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=262.3s	262.3	 And I really worked on my impersonation of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=265.1s	265.1	 Canadian.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=265.8s	265.8	 He's Canadian.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=266.5s	266.5	 And I was like, so Lauren, tell us who were the worst hosts ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=270.1s	270.1	 And he's like, um, that's an interesting question, Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=273.8s	273.8	 We don't like to think of it that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=276.6s	276.6	 But, um, with, um, there in terms of people who thought they were smart and maybe were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=283.8s	283.8	 not as smart as they thought they were, Steven Seagal was a little bit difficult.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=290.9s	290.9	 And what a safe choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=292.5s	292.5	 That's a very safe choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=293.8s	293.8	 There was Chris Christopherson, um, you know, back in 78, he wasn't a musical, um, guest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=300.1s	300.1	 that was Carly Simon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=303.0s	303.0	 And, um, he liked to drink and, uh, in this very green room in 78, he had a couple of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=310.6s	310.6	 drinks during the rehearsal, the dress rehearsal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=313.5s	313.5	 So we, we all did some coffee and like any sports team, when the game starts, we play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=318.9s	318.9	 the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=319.9s	319.9	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=320.2s	320.2	 So who was responsible for the Chad skit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=324.7s	324.7	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=325.0s	325.0	 So Chad's an existing character and that was a really amazing one to watch because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=329.9s	329.9	 we went to Brooklyn to a warehouse and the production was incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=333.7s	333.7	 And what the role I played, if I'm being totally honest, is to just, you know, be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=337.8s	337.8	 Elon's friend and be there with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=338.9s	338.9	 But also, you know, was that funny for you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=341.6s	341.6	 Was that fun?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=342.2s	342.2	 Should I do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=342.7s	342.7	 Should I not do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=343.4s	343.4	 Cause there are some, no, you are a punch up man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=345.3s	345.3	 I was a punch up guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=346.2s	346.2	 I wrote some lines without, you know, taking anything away from the writers there who do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=350.6s	350.6	 the bulk of the work and the actors and the set designers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=352.9s	352.9	 It is amazing to see what they do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=354.8s	354.8	 Like we had to go through 40 scripts and you know, when you read something in a script,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=358.0s	358.0	 it's kind of hard to know if it's funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=359.3s	359.3	 But then when you put Chloe or, you know, Kate McKinnon or Colin Joe's or Che or Mikey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=365.0s	365.0	 Day, like these people are phenomenally talented.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=367.6s	367.6	 So all of a sudden the script comes alive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=370.6s	370.6	 But for the, for the, um, the, the, the, the two punch ups, I got really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=375.4s	375.4	 I'll just give you one anecdote cause I don't want to get myself in too much trouble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=377.8s	377.8	 Were you responsible for besties in the Gen Z hospital?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=380.6s	380.6	 No comment on that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=383.1s	383.1	 I thought that as soon as I saw it, I thought of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=385.7s	385.7	 Yeah, of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=386.3s	386.3	 The other one that I thought was incredibly well done was murder durder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=390.5s	390.5	 Okay. So I had nothing to do with that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=392.6s	392.6	 Um, and I thought we thought that was like, we thought that one was incredibly dumb.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=396.4s	396.4	 Like when you read it on the script, it was like, is this funny or not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=399.2s	399.2	 But they, you know, this is the thing you add tremendous performance and you, uh, add
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=404.5s	404.5	 incredible set design.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=406.3s	406.3	 And we were, we were in Brooklyn at three in the morning and Elon comes out with that wig on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=410.7s	410.7	 in a, in a suit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=412.6s	412.6	 We just start laughing hysterical and he just goes right into creepy priest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=416.7s	416.7	 It was hilarious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=418.2s	418.2	 But what about the Asperger's joke?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=420.6s	420.6	 Because you use that as a tease, uh, amongst people we may mutually know a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=427.8s	427.8	 So when I heard it, I was like, oh, that's a Jason joke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=431.1s	431.1	 That's actually what I'm proud of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=432.3s	432.3	 But what's so ironic is the Asperger's joke came out and then everyone, all these press
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=440.0s	440.0	 articles got written saying, Elon has admitted publicly to having Asperger's and he has,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=445.8s	445.8	 we are so proud of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=446.9s	446.9	 And it is such a moment to come clean about having this, this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=451.0s	451.0	 And it was like a Jason, yeah, this Jason joke that became a, uh, oh my gosh, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=455.8s	455.8	 what are the, I'll tell you, I'm particularly proud of that one because here's how that one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=459.0s	459.0	 went down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=459.9s	459.9	 They had an idea to do Jeopardy and it was probably the flattest pitch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=464.5s	464.5	 Because, you know, it's like 11 o'clock at night, a writer comes in and says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=467.4s	467.4	 we want to do Jeopardy, uh, auditions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=470.0s	470.0	 And we want, it's a kind of a feature for the cast to do auditions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=472.8s	472.8	 I don't know if you ever saw the star wars or additions or Jurassic park.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=475.7s	475.7	 Or it's just kind of in that vein.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=476.8s	476.8	 So I was like, for me, I was like, oh, that sounds like it's got potential, but it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=480.1s	480.1	 a very dry pitch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=480.9s	480.9	 They didn't have any examples.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=482.2s	482.2	 And when they actually did it, it was like really weird characters that were obscure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=486.6s	486.6	 So I had pitched, uh, my own version of Jeopardy and Elon had his version of Jeopardy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=492.1s	492.1	 Elon's version of Jeopardy was dictator Jeopardy, which was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=497.0s	497.0	 Kim Jong-un, you know, MBS, Putin, you know, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=502.2s	502.2	 And then I was like, how to deal with your adversaries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=505.3s	505.3	 And he was like, uh, for 800 and he's like, plenonium.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=508.9s	508.9	 And I was like genocide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=510.2s	510.2	 It was really dark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=513.2s	513.2	 And so we are laughing our asses about that, you know, but then like there were security
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=518.0s	518.0	 concerns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=519.0s	519.0	 Basically we're kind of dialing this around the, it would be as funny as the, it would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=523.9s	523.9	 be a direct correlation of funny to the chances of Elon being assassinated by one of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=528.2s	528.2	 people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=529.0s	529.0	 So then we decided maybe we don't do that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=530.7s	530.7	 And I said, I've got a great idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=532.6s	532.6	 Asperger's Jeopardy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=534.6s	534.6	 And it would be Zuck, Elizabeth Holmes, which Chloe, uh, from the show, who's an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=540.6s	540.6	 absolute genius, incredibly sweet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=542.2s	542.2	 And she really engaged deeply with Elon and connected with our team.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=547.5s	547.5	 And then obviously Elon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=549.0s	549.0	 And so you'd have Elon playing Zuck, somebody playing Elon, and then Chloe playing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=553.7s	553.7	 Elizabeth Holmes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=554.3s	554.3	 And they would be like, you know, um, how to deal with an intense situation with an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=560.6s	560.6	 employee and then presses it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=561.6s	561.6	 Don't make eye contact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=563.9s	563.9	 And so one of the writers, I could tell she was not happy about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=571.8s	571.8	 And she says, listen, my husband has Asperger's, my two brothers have Asperger's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=574.5s	574.5	 And all of a sudden we're in like, okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=577.4s	577.4	 You can't offend anyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=578.6s	578.6	 We can't offend anybody landed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=580.3s	580.3	 I would say, you know, 80, 90% of the staff is very, you know, like, let's go for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=584.6s	584.6	 And then there's probably 10 or 20 who are very sensitive to different topics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=587.8s	587.8	 And so there's a little navigation you have to do there, but we really want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=591.4s	591.4	 And then, so you, I have Asperger's and you know, like the whole room is like, wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=596.2s	596.2	 So then I was workshopping with somebody and I wasn't in the writer's room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=599.8s	599.8	 I contributed 2% that max other than, you know, being Elon's friend and supporting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=605.3s	605.3	 him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=605.8s	605.8	 But, you know, they came in and said, hey, when they didn't want to ask Elon something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=609.6s	609.6	 they came to me and I negotiated some situations like they didn't originally want to have any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=613.9s	613.9	 Doge father or any cryptocurrencies on the show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=616.8s	616.8	 We had to negotiate that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=618.2s	618.2	 Oh my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=619.3s	619.3	 Well, I mean, no, they have, they have, they have general counsel there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=621.8s	621.8	 They have standards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=622.8s	622.8	 They're now on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=623.6s	623.6	 Now, now we know why the show's not funny anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=626.4s	626.4	 There's too many people with the veto.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=627.5s	627.5	 I love the show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=628.2s	628.2	 I think it's very funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=629.0s	629.0	 I just think Elon, Elon made it culturally relevant for the first time in like a decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=633.9s	633.9	 So they can't, what you're describing is too many people with a veto, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=637.6s	637.6	 Over the content of the show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=638.6s	638.6	 That's what makes it not funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=639.8s	639.8	 You got to be willing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=640.6s	640.6	 No, no, I think the show, I think the show is very funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=643.5s	643.5	 I think they take some artistic at risk and what's not funny to us might be like funny
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=648.2s	648.2	 to some other folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=649.4s	649.4	 So that's why it's hit or miss.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=650.3s	650.3	 But certainly moving the show from 1130 on the West Coast definitely has an impact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=654.9s	654.9	 So what they could have done 10 years ago before the timing was synced between the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=659.4s	659.4	 West and East Coast is different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=660.3s	660.3	 They're now on prime time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=661.4s	661.4	 There's still a big cultural shift that's happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=663.8s	663.8	 It's like, you know, I'll give you the two, the two best moments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=667.5s	667.5	 It's not John Belushi anymore when the, the like the corporate CEO comes on the show and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=672.4s	672.4	 wants to do crazier, wilder stuff than the people, you know, who are the regulars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=677.7s	677.7	 But anyway, keep going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=678.9s	678.9	 So anyway, you know, one of the folks who's working on the monologue, you know, comes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=684.2s	684.2	 in and the original monologue, you know, all these things go from rough to potential to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=688.6s	688.6	 good to great to amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=690.6s	690.6	 And so for me, it was, you know, just, you guys know my career choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=693.4s	693.4	 I just really made me think like, maybe I picked the wrong career choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=696.1s	696.1	 Pretty fucking good at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=697.5s	697.5	 I should do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=698.2s	698.2	 So I started to call it at the after party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=699.8s	699.8	 I was like, you know, I've kind of made my money already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=701.4s	701.4	 So any chance I can get an internship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=702.7s	702.7	 He's like, uh, no, but you can always take credit for being the third or fourth writer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=709.3s	709.3	 on Elon's monologue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=710.6s	710.6	 Perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=711.0s	711.0	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=711.4s	711.4	 That'd be great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=712.8s	712.8	 So anyway, they're doing the, they said they wanted to do an Asperger's joke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=716.2s	716.2	 I said, so I wrote the Asperger joke of, you know, hey, I just want to let people know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=721.8s	721.8	 I've got Asperger's and, um, um, so there's not going to be a lot of eye
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=725.4s	725.4	 contact tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=726.5s	726.5	 So if you see me looking off screen, it's not that I'm looking at cue cards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=729.0s	729.0	 It's just that I have Asperger's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=729.9s	729.9	 So they didn't keep the cue card part, but they kept the rest of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=733.0s	733.0	 And then they did the OJ joke, which was written by Colin Jost, who is absolutely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=736.9s	736.9	 phenomenal as a human, uh, just as a writer and a collaborator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=741.4s	741.4	 And we spent a lot of time with Colin Jost.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=743.0s	743.0	 He came in and, um, they had this joke about OJ having been on at 79 and 96.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=748.2s	748.2	 The 96 was a joke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=749.3s	749.3	 He wasn't actually on a 96.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=750.7s	750.7	 I think that's when he went to jail or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=753.1s	753.1	 And I said to him, I said, I don't think people understand the joke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=755.7s	755.7	 They actually think he was on in 96.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=757.7s	757.7	 He goes, well, let's just rehearse it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=758.9s	758.9	 So we're in the green room rehearsing and Elon goes, you know, so, hey, and, um, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=763.2s	763.2	 know, like, OJ, like, you know, like I'm smoking weed on every podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=766.6s	766.6	 It's that's like saying, OJ, you know, you know, you murdered once and now he's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=770.3s	770.3	 murderer forever, you know, and, you know, a side note, he was on in 79 and 96.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=775.4s	775.4	 And I just go like this and he killed both times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=777.7s	777.7	 And the room, there's like a silence and then everybody goes, like, what am I, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=784.2s	784.2	 know, poker aside?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=785.0s	785.0	 That's fabulous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=786.6s	786.6	 And I take a sip of my wine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=788.6s	788.6	 That's fabulous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=789.6s	789.6	 I drop it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=790.6s	790.6	 I bet there was like a split second where everyone looks left and right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=792.8s	792.8	 It's like, is it okay to laugh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=793.8s	793.8	 No, that's my point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=794.6s	794.6	 Like, is it okay to laugh at this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=796.0s	796.0	 And Colin Jost just looks at me and goes, that's getting in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=799.0s	799.0	 And I landed that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=800.3s	800.3	 Um, so there were, you know, some moments like that for me, I tell you, I'll get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=805.5s	805.5	 emotional talking about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=808.1s	808.1	 It's one of the happiest times I've ever seen in Elon's life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=810.8s	810.8	 And I've been with him for 20 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=812.2s	812.2	 I actually have known him for 25, obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=815.4s	815.4	 In the feeling of Monday and Tuesday that, oh my God, this could be a complete utter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=820.2s	820.2	 disaster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=820.7s	820.7	 I mean, that was our fear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=822.2s	822.2	 And that like we were just not in sync here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=824.9s	824.9	 And these, maybe it's going to be unfunny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=826.7s	826.7	 And this is a huge mistake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=828.2s	828.2	 Like that was kind of our vibe from our squad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=830.8s	830.8	 And we had three of us there, including Elon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=834.5s	834.5	 And then, you know, we, the, the Asperger jokes lands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=839.0s	839.0	 And I tell you, a woman from a wardrobe comes in and she's crying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=845.8s	845.8	 She's crying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=847.2s	847.2	 And she says, uh, you know, she sees me first and we, she had been there when we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=851.1s	851.1	 were doing the joke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=852.0s	852.0	 And she said, my son, you know, was beat up for having Asperger's and, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=856.2s	856.2	 this changes everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=859.5s	859.5	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=859.9s	859.9	 Just like it became like a serious thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=862.6s	862.6	 Three or four people came in to the room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=865.1s	865.1	 I kid you not crying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=867.1s	867.1	 Oh my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=868.2s	868.2	 Cause one in 20 kids, one in 20 boys, I think now have Asperger's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=871.7s	871.7	 So do you guys remember in living color?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=873.8s	873.8	 Do you remember that show from the early 90s?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=875.6s	875.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=876.6s	876.6	 Can you juxtapose like, like comedy today and comedy from in living color where they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=881.3s	881.3	 had like Damon Wayans as like the homeless guy and like everything that would be so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=886.6s	886.6	 like non PC today and like totally inappropriate and how much things have shifted where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=891.1s	891.1	 like even the joke becomes like, you know, serious kind of ask a question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=894.2s	894.2	 Sorry, Jason, when, when people were getting emotional, it was because of why they were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=897.8s	897.8	 like, thank you for validating it, putting it out there and showing a role model.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=901.8s	901.8	 That is one of the squawk alley guys, you know, basically got choked up twice on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=906.3s	906.3	 Monday and he said, Elon can go do no wrong in my mind now because I'm dealing with a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=911.4s	911.4	 son who has Asperger's and they do something sometimes that can be very challenging as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=916.6s	916.6	 a parent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=917.4s	917.4	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=918.2s	918.2	 And it just explains a lot about, and we all know people who have Asperger's, David's,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=924.1s	924.1	 and we, we know people who are further on the spectrum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=928.0s	928.0	 As someone who's been accused of being on the spectrum, can I speak to this issue?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=931.1s	931.1	 I mean, like, look, if anything, Asperger's is correlated with an extreme ability to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=937.4s	937.4	 focus and to be successful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=939.0s	939.0	 That's why there's so many people in tech who have Asperger's or have been accused of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=943.0s	943.0	 having Asperger's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=944.1s	944.1	 So I don't know that it's something that people have to be, I guess, unless you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=947.6s	947.6	 like an extremely like extreme case, like on the kind of in the autistic part of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=953.8s	953.8	 spectrum, but like mild Asperger's probably is correlated with success because you, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=958.8s	958.8	 like the opposite of ADD, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=960.2s	960.2	 It's a, it's, it's an extreme ability to focus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=963.8s	963.8	 But honestly, like what you're describing to me sounds so lame, like this is why the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=969.8s	969.8	 show's not funny anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=971.1s	971.1	 It's not about the jokes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=972.7s	972.7	 Look, it should be about the jokes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=974.0s	974.0	 I disagree 100%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=975.3s	975.3	 That joke landed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=976.4s	976.4	 It made everybody laugh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=977.5s	977.5	 It may have landed a little too close to somebody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=979.8s	979.8	 Guys, guys, just to just to just to disinter, the reason David, you're saying this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=985.6s	985.6	 because we all know at least the three of us for the, what was not, what did not make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=990.6s	990.6	 it and what's on the cutting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=991.6s	991.6	 That's why you're saying it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=992.8s	992.8	 And so I think you have to just kind of move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=995.1s	995.1	 You can't get to the counter room floor, but I will tell you what I will, I will reveal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=999.0s	999.0	 one skit that made it to rehearsal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1003.5s	1003.5	 You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1004.8s	1004.8	 I can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1005.6s	1005.6	 It's just one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1006.6s	1006.6	 I mean, there was one they recorded, which I think will come out as a digital short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1009.9s	1009.9	 And the premise is FOMO capital, fear of missing out capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1014.7s	1014.7	 That was good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1016.7s	1016.7	 That was a good one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1017.5s	1017.5	 That was your idea or Elon's?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1020.7s	1020.7	 I'm trying to remember where it originated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1022.2s	1022.2	 We were just talking about, you know, just the state of like people buying NFTs and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1027.6s	1027.6	 everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1028.0s	1028.0	 And I think Elon may have said like, they all have FOMO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1030.4s	1030.4	 And then I was like, yeah, I'd be like a venture capital firm that, and then he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1033.3s	1033.3	 named it FOMO capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1034.2s	1034.2	 So it was a little bit of a collaboration, but I think mostly Elon in that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1037.5s	1037.5	 And this person comes in and the skit is hilarious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1041.9s	1041.9	 So they're probably going to release it as a digital short, like cut for time, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1044.9s	1044.9	 release it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1045.9s	1045.9	 And this person comes in and there's like an associate who's being trained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1051.0s	1051.0	 And he's, they're like, welcome to FOMO capital where we never say no to nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1056.1s	1056.1	 And he's like, okay, I don't know if I understand that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1059.1s	1059.1	 Sit down, you'll get the hang of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1060.1s	1060.1	 And then people come in with increasingly ridiculous ideas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1063.0s	1063.0	 And I'll just tell you one of them, which was when it comes in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1065.7s	1065.7	 Because so you guys know impossible meats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1068.8s	1068.8	 This is impossible vegetables.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1070.8s	1070.8	 These are these tastes just like vegetables, but this broccoli is made with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1077.4s	1077.4	 Endangered white rhinos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1079.6s	1079.6	 She takes a bite of it tastes just like broccoli.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1083.0s	1083.0	 And Elon goes, this is amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1084.6s	1084.6	 And they hand them a Picasso and then somebody comes in and says like, oh, but it's just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1089.5s	1089.5	 hilarious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1090.1s	1090.1	 It's just more and more money being.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1091.6s	1091.6	 Why didn't they get in the show?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1093.4s	1093.4	 Well, what they do is they do a two hour show with a live audience and they just take out two or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1099.3s	1099.3	 three skits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1100.0s	1100.0	 And so there were three skits, I think that were taken out for time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1102.9s	1102.9	 And then those could be released digitally now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1105.0s	1105.0	 So they just want to have extra.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1106.3s	1106.3	 They did a long opening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1107.5s	1107.5	 They did like, I think it was like 10 minutes on the mother's day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1111.4s	1111.4	 Can I just say Miley Cyrus has the most incredible voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1115.3s	1115.3	 Oh my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1116.2s	1116.2	 I could listen to her sing forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1119.8s	1119.8	 She has got an incredible voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1124.9s	1124.9	 I thought the opening was really shaky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1126.6s	1126.6	 I mean, I was there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1127.8s	1127.8	 This is the first time I've watched live TV in like 10 years ever since Apple TV was invented.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1132.0s	1132.0	 I'm sitting there waiting for Elon to come out and crush the monologue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1136.4s	1136.4	 And then Miley Cyrus does this long unfunny thing with all these mothers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1140.9s	1140.9	 It's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1141.4s	1141.4	 You know, it's meant to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1142.2s	1142.2	 First of all, first of all, it's not a thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1144.6s	1144.6	 It was a song.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1145.7s	1145.7	 It was a song.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1146.3s	1146.3	 That's called the song.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1148.2s	1148.2	 It was a WTF moment for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1150.0s	1150.0	 I was like, where is Elon?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1152.4s	1152.4	 Bring out Elon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1153.4s	1153.4	 I'm not here to see a bunch of mothers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1157.5s	1157.5	 I'll tell you, that was an interesting moment, David, because they were like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1160.6s	1160.6	 you know, I will put you in like four of the skits out of the seven and Elon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1163.7s	1163.7	 And we don't want to work, you know, Elon too hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1166.1s	1166.1	 So I was doing these sort of sidebars with some of the producers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1169.8s	1169.8	 one in particular, who is just a phenomenon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1172.1s	1172.1	 She's an amazing producer who just gets everything done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1175.8s	1175.8	 because this all occurs from Monday to Saturday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1178.5s	1178.5	 And they work 16, 18 hours a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1181.8s	1181.8	 And, you know, she said, you know, we don't want to take up too much of his time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1186.3s	1186.3	 So we think four is the right number.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1187.5s	1187.5	 And I said, you know, he gave up the week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1189.4s	1189.4	 He's the busiest guy in the world, arguably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1191.7s	1191.7	 He wants to be in every skit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1192.9s	1192.9	 And she's like, well, nobody really does that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1194.8s	1194.8	 Maybe a comedian here or there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1196.6s	1196.6	 And, you know, I just said, if I'm here, use me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1200.0s	1200.0	 I want to be in every skit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1201.0s	1201.0	 And like they we had to like reshuffle the deck a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1203.8s	1203.8	 And he was willing to do anything, including Wario or, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1208.2s	1208.2	 and wear a costume or be the creepy priest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1210.8s	1210.8	 He, you know, Elon was funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1213.4s	1213.4	 I think he surprised everyone in terms of being a performer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1216.6s	1216.6	 Just in terms of his performance, I think it was really strong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1221.0s	1221.0	 It was as good as like, you know, someone who's in the entertainment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1223.6s	1223.6	 business would be, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1226.8s	1226.8	 Yeah, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1227.4s	1227.4	 It's a universal take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1228.2s	1228.2	 Even Elon sort of haters had to concede that he performed well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1233.0s	1233.0	 He kind of committed to all those roles, even when it was like poking fun at himself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1237.4s	1237.4	 Yeah, I had to I had to dunk on Professor Dummy Galloway, who was like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1243.5s	1243.5	 I'm going to live tweet Elon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1244.9s	1244.9	 And he's just like going on CNN talking about Elon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1247.3s	1247.3	 He's going on every fucking cable channel he can to like ride Elon's coattails.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1252.1s	1252.1	 And he tweeted Elon would Tesla would lose 80, 90 percent of its value two years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1256.5s	1256.5	 Like, just are you kidding me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1258.9s	1258.9	 But I agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1259.5s	1259.5	 Like even someone like Professor Galloway, who said Tesla was worthless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1263.8s	1263.8	 He is now just all over it and in it humanized him, you know, which is nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1270.1s	1270.1	 I think he did a great job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1271.1s	1271.1	 And it was fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1272.8s	1272.8	 I'm super happy for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1274.5s	1274.5	 Lauren Michaels came in and said, Elon, you did a great job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1278.9s	1278.9	 Come back anytime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1280.6s	1280.6	 Sincerely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1281.5s	1281.5	 And I said, how about next year?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1284.1s	1284.1	 Like, you're like, you're like, basically, what do we do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1290.6s	1290.6	 He's a punch up guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1292.0s	1292.0	 He's the agent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1293.0s	1293.0	 He's the hype man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1293.9s	1293.9	 The negotiator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1296.2s	1296.2	 I was doing mostly negotiation and Laura Michael said, absolutely, Jason, we'd love to have Elon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1301.4s	1301.4	 back. You absolutely crushed it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1303.4s	1303.4	 And, you know, Elon's busy in the green room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1307.0s	1307.0	 By the way, do we know what the ratings were?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1309.0s	1309.0	 Third best show of the season so far, I think, not counting all the YouTube views and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1313.0s	1313.0	 international views.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1314.2s	1314.2	 I think Chappelle is the only person who beat him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1316.6s	1316.6	 So a couple of those skits are going to live forever, I think, on YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1321.6s	1321.6	 I mean, the Chad skit in particular was really hit it out of the park.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1326.5s	1326.5	 By the way, my observation on the skits were the ones where Elon was kind of indispensable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1333.0s	1333.0	 were like the really were really great, like the Chad thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1335.7s	1335.7	 And I thought that the West where La Ron, you know, where he plays this like 18th century
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1340.8s	1340.8	 old west version of himself, it's like this genius in the old west who's telling them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1345.2s	1345.2	 to ride electric horses or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1347.4s	1347.4	 For me, that was really funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1349.1s	1349.1	 So I thought the ones where Elon was sort of indispensable, the more indispensable Elon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1352.7s	1352.7	 was to the skit, I thought the better it was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1355.0s	1355.0	 And then some of the skits, I mean, look, live sketch comedy is very hit or miss.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1358.3s	1358.3	 I thought the ones that were more missed were the ones where they could have done them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1362.4s	1362.4	 without Elon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1363.0s	1363.0	 It could have been a skit, any SNL?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1366.2s	1366.2	 I think it's accurate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1367.8s	1367.8	 Yeah, it's like, why wouldn't you take advantage of having Elon there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1371.4s	1371.4	 And they did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1372.6s	1372.6	 And just to the staff, first off, I'm sorry I was such a ruckus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1378.8s	1378.8	 And I just rubbed her in the space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1381.7s	1381.7	 But really, I mean, what a great time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1383.9s	1383.9	 Elon had a great time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1384.8s	1384.8	 The after party was amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1388.8s	1388.8	 Describe the after party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1389.8s	1389.8	 Were they wearing masks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1390.7s	1390.7	 Oh, that's a good segue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1393.5s	1393.5	 That's a good segue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1394.7s	1394.7	 That's outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1396.3s	1396.3	 I'll just leave it at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1397.8s	1397.8	 It was an outside party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1399.4s	1399.4	 But we danced until, this is actually for real,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1403.5s	1403.5	 and I think is a good segue into just what we're seeing out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1407.0s	1407.0	 I left San Francisco having been yelled at somebody because my mask fell off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1410.9s	1410.9	 I didn't know it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1411.8s	1411.8	 And I had gone into a store and they were like, your mask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1415.5s	1415.5	 They yelled it across the store.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1417.0s	1417.0	 You know, and I was like, oh, sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1418.0s	1418.0	 You know, just kind of, you know how when they fall off, you don't notice it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1421.2s	1421.2	 Then I got to Austin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1423.2s	1423.2	 And when I'm in Austin, I'm walking down the street.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1425.2s	1425.2	 I'm the only person in Austin wearing a mask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1427.2s	1427.2	 And somebody points at me and goes, you don't have to wear that mask, son.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1430.7s	1430.7	 And I was like, oh, and I look around, there's nobody wearing a mask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1433.6s	1433.6	 It's my first day there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1434.6s	1434.6	 And he goes, you've been vaccinated?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1436.2s	1436.2	 I said, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1437.0s	1437.0	 He goes, you really don't need to wear a mask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1439.4s	1439.4	 So I take the mask off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1440.6s	1440.6	 I get to Florida.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1441.8s	1441.8	 A friend of mine was out, you know, at having a cocktail at a bar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1446.2s	1446.2	 Invites me to meet him for a cocktail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1448.2s	1448.2	 I go to meet him for a cocktail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1449.8s	1449.8	 There's a DJ and he who shall he who shall not be named.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1453.8s	1453.8	 Anyway, I want to have a cocktail as one does in Miami.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1457.2s	1457.2	 There's 100 200 people, 200 people in the club.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1460.1s	1460.1	 The only people wearing masks are the staff who are wearing them as chin guards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1464.0s	1464.0	 And I'm like, that's not the purpose of a mess, but okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1466.5s	1466.5	 So and then I get to New York and everybody in New York is wearing one or two masks on the street.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1474.4s	1474.4	 On I walked down an empty street.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1476.4s	1476.4	 Okay, so we should talk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1477.4s	1477.4	 We should talk about that CDC article that was in the New York Times,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1480.0s	1480.0	 because that's an incredible summary, Jason, of this whole issue in a nutshell, which is it's unbelievable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1485.8s	1485.8	 And then to just give Saturday Night Live a nod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1488.7s	1488.7	 Every day, everybody tested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1490.6s	1490.6	 You got, you know, two tests like the I forget the names of them now, since I stopped taking them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1496.0s	1496.0	 But you did like the big one and the small one every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1499.3s	1499.3	 You got tested every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1500.2s	1500.2	 You got wristbands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1501.6s	1501.6	 You had to wear a mask 100% of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1503.4s	1503.4	 And then when you were in the studio, you had to wear the glass shield.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1506.2s	1506.2	 So if you saw the picture I did of myself and Elon and blood pop, Michael,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1510.0s	1510.0	 who's a famous producer for Justin Bieber, and Lady Gaga, who's a friend of ours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1515.0s	1515.0	 Mike had to wear it too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1516.2s	1516.2	 So we're we're I mean, Elon had a mask on because he had to take it off to do skits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1519.6s	1519.6	 But all the rehearsals, everybody was masked up, including the actors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1525.3s	1525.3	 And everybody was vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1527.9s	1527.9	 So they really are taking this seriously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1530.5s	1530.5	 I understand because they in New York, they had a ton of people die.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1534.4s	1534.4	 And to get my understanding is what I heard secondhand was that Lauren Michaels had to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1540.5s	1540.5	 a special variance to keep Saturday Night Live on the air from, you know, the governor and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1544.6s	1544.6	 mayor and everybody had to sign off on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1546.4s	1546.4	 But I tweeted this is not taking COVID seriously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1550.3s	1550.3	 This is this is basically an irrational fear of COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1553.9s	1553.9	 Well, because they got hit the hardest, David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1556.2s	1556.2	 So I think that they get hit the hardest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1557.7s	1557.7	 And I tweeted, why is everybody wearing a mask in New York?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1560.2s	1560.2	 And of course, I got like 100.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1562.0s	1562.0	 Because there's a pandemic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1563.5s	1563.5	 But then what the two reasons that made sense were so many people died.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1567.3s	1567.3	 And there was so much suffering in New York, that people out of a sign of respect are still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1570.7s	1570.7	 wearing them until they hit your herd immunity officially.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1573.9s	1573.9	 Which I know you could roll your eyes at David, but you know, they did have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1577.0s	1577.0	 It would be an equation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1578.2s	1578.2	 I don't think that's the real reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1580.1s	1580.1	 No, I do actually do think it's the real reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1582.4s	1582.4	 Because people multiple people said to me, it's a way of showing people that you actually care
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1586.0s	1586.0	 about them, and that you're going to really take this seriously until the end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1589.0s	1589.0	 No, I think it's it's more what Ezra Klein said, which is this is the red MAGA hat for team blue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1593.8s	1593.8	 This is pure virtue signaling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1595.8s	1595.8	 Possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1596.6s	1596.6	 The other thing they said was on a practical basis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1599.6s	1599.6	 In New York, you're, you know, on the subway, your office and in, you know, going into a cafe,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1604.9s	1604.9	 you have to wear it and you're doing that 17 times a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1608.7s	1608.7	 So taking the mask on and off just becomes less work than just leaving it on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1612.9s	1612.9	 That's those were reasonable answers I got.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1615.1s	1615.1	 But anyway, somebody summarize this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1617.8s	1617.8	 Another reason, I think, is that look, if you're if you're in a blue part of the country,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1623.4s	1623.4	 the media sources for team blue are still promoting this idea that outdoor spread is a thing that it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1631.2s	1631.2	 it's a risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1633.1s	1633.1	 We're finally now getting we've known since last summer that there were no cases, no documented
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1639.5s	1639.5	 cases of casual outdoor spread anywhere in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1642.6s	1642.6	 The Atlantic was reporting on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1644.5s	1644.5	 Okay, this is not a conservative publication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1647.0s	1647.0	 This is a liberal, a skew liberal publication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1650.2s	1650.2	 Liberal leaning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1651.3s	1651.3	 Yes, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1652.3s	1652.3	 So we've known since last summer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1653.8s	1653.8	 I mean, when Gavin Newsom declared that we weren't allowed to go to the beach,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1657.5s	1657.5	 it was widely mocked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1659.0s	1659.0	 And so only now is the CDC getting around to loosening its guidance on outdoor mask wearing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1665.4s	1665.4	 but it's still not loose enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1666.9s	1666.9	 And so there was a great article by David Leonard in the New York Times that just came out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1671.5s	1671.5	 I think, yesterday or two days ago, about the cautious CDC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1676.6s	1676.6	 And what he said is, by the way, this is valid,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1678.9s	1678.9	 is everything we've been saying on the pod for the last few months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1681.0s	1681.0	 Leonard chronicles the sort of absurdly conservative guidance given by the CDC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1687.1s	1687.1	 Basically, the CDC continues to suggest that outdoor transmission accounts for up to 10%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1692.6s	1692.6	 of cases, when the real number is certainly under 1% is probably under 0.1%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1698.1s	1698.1	 And this is all based on a single study in Singapore where that was misclassified.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1703.8s	1703.8	 It was based on a construction site that really wasn't even an outdoor spread.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1707.6s	1707.6	 And yet the CDC still insists that unvaccinated people need to wear masks outdoors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1712.2s	1712.2	 that vaccinated people wear them in large public values,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1715.3s	1715.3	 and that children at summer camp wear them at all times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1718.4s	1718.4	 This is the current CDC guidance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1720.7s	1720.7	 And so yesterday, when the head of the CDC was pulled in front of a congressional hearing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1725.0s	1725.0	 and asked about this, she doubled down on this less than 10%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1729.9s	1729.9	 And the reason why it's so misleading is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1732.2s	1732.2	 technically speaking, less than 10% is correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1735.1s	1735.1	 But when the real number is 0.001% or something like that, it's highly misleading to give 10%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1741.8s	1741.8	 And the reason- Well, the line in the article, which I loved, is it is accurate to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1747.4s	1747.4	 that sharks eat less than 200,000 humans a year, but it is also more accurate to say sharks attack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1754.4s	1754.4	 150 humans a year. And 150 is very different than 200,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1759.1s	1759.1	 But if you say sharks attack 200,000 people or less a year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1764.0s	1764.0	 you would think that it's a much bigger problem than it actually is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1767.2s	1767.2	 And I think that's the whole point, which is, we're not being scientific.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1772.2s	1772.2	 We're being emotional and reactive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1774.6s	1774.6	 And the paper that Leonard references, basically, they took this data that identified how spread
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1781.4s	1781.4	 was occurring empirically and identifying through tracing where are people actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1786.6s	1786.6	 picking up COVID. And that's really where this empirical evidence suggests we're talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1791.5s	1791.5	 a less than 0.1% casual outdoor spread rate. And you can see that empirically in the data,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1798.9s	1798.9	 but then there's also this deterministic kind of approach where you could say, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1802.3s	1802.3	 how does spread happen? Spread happens with viruses. We know that viruses need to live in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1805.9s	1805.9	 liquid in order to survive when you're outdoors. If there's any amount of wind or UV light,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1810.9s	1810.9	 the virus can very quickly degrade. The protein can degrade. The RNA doesn't transfer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1815.0s	1815.0	 And so there's a deterministic rationale for scientific rationale for why that may be the case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1819.3s	1819.3	 And this evidence that this paper, which I've now shared, kind of gathers together shows that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1824.9s	1824.9	 that is indeed what the statistics are showing. And so, yeah, you're right. But I think the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1829.7s	1829.7	 precautionary principle, David, is where the argument would be made on the other side,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1833.4s	1833.4	 which is, what's the cost of wearing a mask if there's any risk at all?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1837.7s	1837.7	 And by the way, I'm not making this case personally, but I think that's where a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1841.1s	1841.1	 of people would make the counter argument rather than debate the facts and the evidence and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1846.4s	1846.4	 science, they would say, but who cares? It's just a mask. Why does that matter? And so I think the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1851.7s	1851.7	 question is, why does it matter? Right? Like, why does it matter if they're telling us to wear masks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1855.8s	1855.8	 Is there really that much of a cost to people to do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1859.0s	1859.0	 Well, I mean, if people are doing it voluntarily, that's their right to do so. But the question is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1864.8s	1864.8	 mass mandate. Should we continue to have mandates on the population for something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1870.2s	1870.2	 that isn't necessary? And look, I was one of the first people in March of 2000 to call for

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1880.5s	1880.5	 that they were effective. They were high cost or high benefit, low cost. So I was in favor of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1885.8s	1885.8	 when there was a pandemic raging. But when T0, the rate of transmission is in freefall everywhere,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1891.8s	1891.8	 and now we've learned that outdoor spread is not an issue, I don't support restricting people's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1896.9s	1896.9	 freedom. And if you know, for a reason that's not rooted in science. And, you know, the problem with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1903.9s	1903.9	 the CDC guidance is that people really act on it. So you've got politicians, you've got local
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1909.8s	1909.8	 jurisdictions who will not schools schools, I mean, so the schools have remained closed. And by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1915.9s	1915.9	 way, the schools have been open in Texas and Florida for six months, we know, based on empirical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1920.9s	1920.9	 data in the real world, seeing what's happening in Texas and Florida that that you're not seeing an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1925.3s	1925.3	 increase in COVID cases in those places, because of school reopening. And yet, the CDC has not moved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1930.3s	1930.3	 his guidance on school reopening, you have summer camps now that for liability reasons, will make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1935.8s	1935.8	 kids wear masks, because they can't take the risk of getting sued. And then you've got politicians
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1940.2s	1940.2	 like Gavin Newsom, who won't wipe their ass without the CDC's permission to do so. So it has a real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1946.3s	1946.3	 consequence in the real world, that the CDC is stuck on this ridiculous guidance. Did we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1952.0s	1952.0	 read the actual sentence from the New York Times about under 10%? So the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1957.8s	1957.8	 No, you could read it because it's really sad, actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1961.3s	1961.3	 Just in terms of the misleading CDC numbers, they said, in quotes, under 10% of the spread has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1965.6s	1965.6	 occurred outside, when in reality, the share of transmission that occurred outdoors seems to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1970.7s	1970.7	 below 1% and maybe below point 1% multiple edemiologists told me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1975.8s	1975.8	 Right. Well, also, also read the quote, this is directly from David Leonardo, the New York Times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1980.5s	1980.5	 And I think it's important to, you know, it's great when you can quote the New York Times or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1984.1s	1984.1	 the Atlantic, because these are left leaning publications. So Team Blue should be more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1990.0s	1990.0	 willing to accept them. What Leonardo said is there's not a single documented COVID infection
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1995.0s	1995.0	 anywhere in the world from casual outdoor interactions. But do people know that? I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=1999.8s	1999.8	 do the people walking down the street with masks on know that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2004.0s	2004.0	 Well, they'll know it now because according, by the way, did you guys know, Jason just told me this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2008.9s	2008.9	 we accumulate a million views slash listens a week to our podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2014.6s	2014.6	 Yeah, now that the archive's growing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2016.0s	2016.0	 Yeah. So now that now now a million people will at least know. I mean, they'll at least.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2020.3s	2020.3	 I think it's, you know, it's a good segue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2022.9s	2022.9	 It's a little bit self selective. So let's be honest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2025.3s	2025.3	 Yeah, for intelligence. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2026.7s	2026.7	 No, but like, no, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2027.8s	2027.8	 I mean, actually, some of the people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2028.9s	2028.9	 No, no, no. But the real question is like, isn't this an opportunity for the CDC to actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2033.6s	2033.6	 reestablish some credibility, which is to say, okay, we're going to get back to facts. We're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2037.6s	2037.6	 going to we are not. We know that people will be prone to acting on anecdote and emotion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2042.4s	2042.4	 So we're going to be grounded in truth. In fact, we went back, we looked at the Singapore study.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2047.1s	2047.1	 Here are the flaws in it. Here's how it applies. And so we're going to own it and revise it. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2052.0s	2052.0	 that would go such a long way. The fact is, they, they, it's, it's important to understand, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2057.6s	2057.6	 what do you think the incentives are for them to keep doubling down on bad decision making?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2062.5s	2062.5	 By the way, there's no downside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2064.9s	2064.9	 I think I said this, I think I said this a few months ago, which is I don't think that the CDC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2069.0s	2069.0	 or any kind of medical, you know, administrative group in particular, has to think about the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2079.5s	2079.5	 synthesis of the effects of some of the policy that they're recommending. Their objective is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2084.5s	2084.5	 to save lives. So if I'm running the CDC, I'm going to tell people don't leave your home ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2089.0s	2089.0	 Don't drink alcohol. Don't eat red meat. Exercise, you have to exercise 60 minutes a day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2093.3s	2093.3	 or you get taxed. I mean, there's a lot of things that you could see if you were purely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2097.1s	2097.1	 focused on saving lives, you would make specific recommendations only to save lives without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2102.0s	2102.0	 thinking about the consequences outside of saving lives. The consequences outside of saving lives of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2107.9s	2107.9	 you know, telling people to wear masks, is it minimizes economic activity, some might argue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2112.3s	2112.3	 Therefore, there's going to be an impact on airlines and hotels and outdoor thing and spending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2116.7s	2116.7	 and all this other stuff, people being willing to go to work and people being afraid of being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2119.9s	2119.9	 in the office. I mean, I see this across all my companies where people, even though they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2124.6s	2124.6	 vaccinated and they're scientists, they're afraid to go to work. And so, you know, part of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2129.7s	2129.7	 perpetuation of the fear that arises from these policies that are all about the absolute saving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2136.2s	2136.2	 of any life is that you end up having a significant cost that's not related to the objectives of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2142.2s	2142.2	 particular medical organization. And we see it around the world. Sorry, this just goes back to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2147.8s	2147.8	 what I said about leadership a few episodes ago, which is the leadership of the administration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2152.3s	2152.3	 should be synthesizing the recommendation of that group, along with the effect that other groups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2157.4s	2157.4	 might be indicating would arise from that recommendation and coming up with a kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2161.2s	2161.2	 concrete, you know, kind of objective around, okay, well, how do we balance these different effects?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2165.7s	2165.7	 What you're saying is absolutely correct. The people who are making the decisions are only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2169.0s	2169.0	 thinking about their responsibility. So it's like a Secret Service agent when the president's like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2173.6s	2173.6	 can I go out and sign autographs? Absolutely not. They're going to say no, because they are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2177.5s	2177.5	 responsible for keeping the president alive. Now, they're the other pernicious thing about this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2183.9s	2183.9	 they kept trying to game the public. And the public when you try to game the public and you get caught
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2189.3s	2189.3	 where they say don't vouches don't wear a mask, because he doesn't want to run out of masks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2193.1s	2193.1	 then they say keep the masks on because they want to, you know, virtue signal or whatever it is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2198.3s	2198.3	 or they won't simply say the vaccine is not dangerous, or that the vaccine is actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2204.1s	2204.1	 going to keep you from dying, they undersold the vaccine. And now, everybody's going to question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2210.0s	2210.0	 everything they do for all time. Don't manage us. Manage the facts. Stop trying to manage people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2217.6s	2217.6	 and just start managing your communication and make it crisp and clear. And then somebody has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2223.4s	2223.4	 to be a goddamn leader and say, Okay, the doctors are saying this, the economy is saying this. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2228.5s	2228.5	 here's how those two things overlap. In schools being closed means more suicide in kids, more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2233.4s	2233.4	 depression in kids, and people not being able to put food on their tables means we're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2238.0s	2238.0	 create who knows what this economic policy is going to create, which is another segue. David,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2243.7s	2243.7	 you had something to say? Well, look, I agree with that. But I think you guys are being a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2247.4s	2247.4	 bit too charitable to the CDC. It's not just that they're wrong. And it's not just that they have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2252.6s	2252.6	 bureaucratic incentive for for CYA, and to be too conservative in their guidance. It's the fact that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2259.7s	2259.7	 when an error gets pointed out, like by David Leonhard in the New York Times, they double down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2265.6s	2265.6	 on the lie. And so, Leonhard followed up his article, it happened. So, go to this tweet that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2271.1s	2271.1	 I just put in the chat. He said, at a Senate hearing today, Senator Collins asked CDC Director,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2275.8s	2275.8	 Dr. Walensky, about today's edition of Morning, which was his article, which explains why the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2280.4s	2280.4	 CDC's claim that less than 10% of COVID transmission is misleading. And Walensky then doubles down and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2285.6s	2285.6	 has a bunch of excuses and basically defends this 10% number, which is a lie. Now, why would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2291.1s	2291.1	 the CDC be doing this? There is separate reporting by the New York Post. Go to this article on teachers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2297.8s	2297.8	 unions collaborated with the CDC on school reopenings. So, this guidance that the CDC put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2303.8s	2303.8	 forward on school reopenings, the teachers unions were part of writing that guidance, and all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2310.0s	2310.0	 their suggestions were actually accepted and incorporated by the CDC. Now, how is this science?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2316.5s	2316.5	 This is politics. Last year, there were a bunch of articles accusing the Trump administration of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2324.8s	2324.8	 incorporating political considerations into their guidance. There were huge scandals about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2330.7s	2330.7	 Where is the reporting today about the influence that the teachers unions are wielding over the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2337.1s	2337.1	 CDC to deliberately keep schools closed, even though the science does not support that? This
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2343.3s	2343.3	 is a gigantic scandal. And yet, no one's covering it. It's left for the New York Post to cover this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2348.3s	2348.3	 instead of the New York Times. By the way, I think this is a good transition to that Druckenmiller
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2352.6s	2352.6	 interview because, you know, Sachs, I just retweeted what you had sent, which was a link to the video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2359.4s	2359.4	 interview. So, you know, Stanley Druckenmiller is this incredible, incredible investor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2367.0s	2367.0	 G-O-A-T Goat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2369.7s	2369.7	 There's many stories about Druckenmiller. At one point, you know, he's the guy that notoriously,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2373.7s	2373.7	 they say, broke the Bank of England, where he was betting against the British pound and forced the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2378.4s	2378.4	 central bankers in the UK to devalue the pound. And he's made billions of dollars managing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2384.1s	2384.1	 initially, George Soros' money and then spun off and runs his own money now as an investor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2389.8s	2389.8	 And so he's a macro guy. So he thinks about kind of macroeconomic conditions and effects. And he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2395.4s	2395.4	 talks a lot about Fed policy. So he gave this interview on CNBC. And I think the, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2401.4s	2401.4	 the most kind of prescient quote, and it was also based on an op-ed he wrote, right Sachs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2405.9s	2405.9	 in the Wall Street Journal? Yeah. Yeah. But the interview is fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2409.3s	2409.3	 The TV interview is great. Just watch that. The interview is great. And he said, in the write-up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2413.7s	2413.7	 he said, clinging to an emergency after the emergency has passed is what the Fed behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2419.4s	2419.4	 indicates right now. And I think that, you know, kind of what we're talking about broadly is perhaps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2423.9s	2423.9	 the emergency in the United States where you have this uncontrolled increase in COVID cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2429.8s	2429.8	 That's not the case today. So the emergency has passed. We still have COVID, but it is not an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2435.4s	2435.4	 emergency. And the point is, there's a lot of institutions and individuals and businesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2441.2s	2441.2	 that are still operating as if we were in the throes of the emergency. And so Druckenmiller
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2446.4s	2446.4	 is making the case that the Fed and the Fed policy is acting as if we're in an emergency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2451.3s	2451.3	 But broadly, we're seeing this across a lot of institutions like the teachers unions and others
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2455.4s	2455.4	 where people are effectively, you know, never let a good emergency go by without taking advantage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2459.0s	2459.0	 or whatever the saying is. Never waste a crisis. Never waste a crisis. And the crisis, keep the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2463.5s	2463.5	 crisis going is kind of the model everyone's in right now. Milk the crisis. They're keeping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2468.4s	2468.4	 it going as long as they can. And Druckenmiller gave some pretty amazing quotes. He said that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2473.4s	2473.4	 well, first of all, he described our current monetary fiscal policy as being the most radical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2477.8s	2477.8	 he had ever seen. And this guy's been watching markets for decades. The Fed has pumped 2.5 trillion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2484.5s	2484.5	 of QE into the economy post-vaccine, post-retail recovery. He said that right now, retail demand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2491.6s	2491.6	 is five years above trend, meaning not only has retail demand fully recovered, it's where,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2496.2s	2496.2	 if you look at the trend line, it would be five years from now. So they are pumping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2501.0s	2501.0	 like demand like crazy. They've issued six trillion of new debt. And then this is the thing I didn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2506.6s	2506.6	 know at all. He said the Fed is buying 60% of new debt issues. Without this, the bond market would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2513.8s	2513.8	 be rejecting this massive fiscal expansion because interest rates would become prohibitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2518.5s	2518.5	 And he said that when interest rates revert to the norm, the historical norm, interest expense on our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2524.2s	2524.2	 debt will be 30% of the government budget. So I mean, think about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2528.6s	2528.6	 Look, the markets have had to intervene. And we have essentially decoupled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2537.0s	2537.0	 what the government thinks is happening with what the capital markets needs people to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2543.6s	2543.6	 And that's a really unique dynamic. I mean, I'm not nearly as successful as Stan or have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2549.2s	2549.2	 in the markets as long as him. But in my 20 years, this is the first time I've really seen that. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2554.6s	2554.6	 just to give you a sense of this, the markets are now acting to establish inflation expectations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2561.7s	2561.7	 that the Fed just seems to not want to do anything about. And so just to give you guys a sense of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2567.7s	2567.7	 this, when in February, the markets really kind of had its first capitulation, what happened was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2575.0s	2575.0	 that all of a sudden people digested all these facts that Stan just said and realized, wait a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2580.2s	2580.2	 minute, like all of this money is going to drive prices higher. And so what they did was they took
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2585.4s	2585.4	 the yield on the 10 year bond up by like 100 basis points. And the markets freaked out. They
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2592.5s	2592.5	 went from like 0.75 to 1.75. And the Fed came out and said, hey, hold on, nothing to see here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2600.1s	2600.1	 Everything's going to be fine. But then everything since then has been sort of leading to this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2604.7s	2604.7	 realization. Commodity prices are up 50%. There's this kind of like joke that like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2610.3s	2610.3	 you see a bed of lumber moving across a railroad. That's like a billion dollars of lumber just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2615.8s	2615.8	 because of how expensive it is. You know, there are shortages everywhere. You'll be shocked to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2621.0s	2621.0	 know that today, Chipotle put out the following guidance, which is they said they are increasing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2628.3s	2628.3	 the minimum wage to $15. And that within three years, you can make $100,000 a year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2636.2s	2636.2	 at Chipotle. Yeah. That is as much as some engineers and coders in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2644.9s	2644.9	 Dara Korshashawi, the CEO of Uber said on the Uber earnings call last week that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2651.3s	2651.3	 average hourly rate that some drivers in New York, Uber drivers in New York were getting paid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2657.4s	2657.4	 was 38 bucks an hour. What $38 an hour. So what does all of this mean? I think what Stan is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2664.2s	2664.2	 trying to say, but we're in this weird place where we've decoupled the government institution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2670.0s	2670.0	 that's responsible for fiscal stability. And then the overall capital markets used to work in tandem,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2676.3s	2676.3	 and they're no longer working in tandem because you have a narrative and a set of data points
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2681.4s	2681.4	 that aren't supported by the facts. And so this is an interesting thing. So in the CDC versus the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2686.8s	2686.8	 American people example, there's no way to push back, right? I mean, governors can act independently,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2693.4s	2693.4	 cities will act independently. But at the end of the day, you know, the teachers unions are working
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2697.0s	2697.0	 with the CDC, the school camps have this guidance and you're stuck in this morass. In the capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2704.2s	2704.2	 markets, that's not necessarily true. And so you can change and you can, you can re-rate asset prices
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2710.7s	2710.7	 based on sentiment. And I think what everybody is saying in this example is we're past the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2716.2s	2716.2	 emergency. We've put too much money in the economy. We need to reopen. And we now need to face the fact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2724.3s	2724.3	 that there are massively rising prices, which means that there will be inflation. And if you don't act,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2731.7s	2731.7	 the capital markets will continue to act for us. And so this is an example today where you're just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2737.0s	2737.0	 seeing a bloodbath in the markets. And by the way, the only time the two government officials tried
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2741.7s	2741.7	 to be on the either side, Janet Yellen last Friday, kind of casually in an interview,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2748.1s	2748.1	 kind of put her toe out in the water as treasury secretary and kind of said something that said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2752.8s	2752.8	 there could be inflation and literally was hand slapped and had to put out something that disavowed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2757.5s	2757.5	 her comments less than 24 hours later. So that's where we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2761.4s	2761.4	 There's a bloodbath in the markets today. And there's been one for the last couple of months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2766.2s	2766.2	 And in particular, all the growth stocks have been hammered. And just to build on what you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2769.9s	2769.9	 saying, Chamath, so there's an announcement today, there's some data that the inflation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2774.6s	2774.6	 the CPI is up 4% and climbing. And so people are now pricing in big interest rate increases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2782.5s	2782.5	 And so that makes growth stock that hammers growth stocks because all the earnings are in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2786.1s	2786.1	 the distant future. And so they get now discounted at a higher rate. And so the valuations get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2791.1s	2791.1	 absolutely hammered. So, you know, it's absolutely souring. The markets are basically souring on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2799.0s	2799.0	 Biden agenda. And, you know, I just, you know, I'm beginning to wonder if Biden's going to be a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2805.6s	2805.6	 Jimmy Carter here, because, frankly, all he had to do was leave things well enough alone. COVID was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2812.5s	2812.5	 winding down, we had a vaccine, all they had to do was distribute it to as many people as possible,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2817.8s	2817.8	 end COVID, let the recovery take shape. And instead, they push this insane $10 trillion agenda
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2825.5s	2825.5	 of taxes and spending that are now overstimulating the economy that are causing inflation that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2832.1s	2832.1	 now creating interest rate increases. No, that's that's not that's not true yet. Meaning,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2836.8s	2836.8	 he did do a good job on the vaccine, David. But then to your point, the federal government's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2841.0s	2841.0	 posture on reopening is still been stunted. And he's proposing so much more incremental capital,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2847.7s	2847.7	 which we all know, probably will not be efficiently spent. And there isn't any other good ideas. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2854.8s	2854.8	 he believes his path to reelection, which is true is to spend and to put money to put money to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2860.7s	2860.7	 economy. It's gonna backfire. I think it's a backfire master. And to tax, right. So he's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2865.1s	2865.1	 spending he's trying to offset with higher taxes on the wealthy, which, you know, from his point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2871.1s	2871.1	 of view is not going to affect him. And the analysis is probably fair. It's not going to affect his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2876.4s	2876.4	 his voter block significantly going to backfire massively. Look, if the economy turns, we were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2882.1s	2882.1	 set for a post COVID boom. And right now that is all at risk because tomorrow, like you're saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2887.8s	2887.8	 they're keeping the economy closed or part parts of it way too long, they then overcompensate for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2892.9s	2892.9	 that by printing a ton of money. And then they overcompensate for that by raising taxes too much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2898.0s	2898.0	 just to build on that. So that second step of their overcompensating, their inability to open
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2904.6s	2904.6	 with money is so true. Because then what happens is your labor force stays impaired because people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2910.9s	2910.9	 make enough money by not working. This is the issue right now for a lot of businesses. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2915.9s	2915.9	 you have restaurants that are overbooked cannot get servers. Jim Kramer was saying he's he's up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2921.7s	2921.7	 to $18, you know, per hour per servers, he's going to move it to 20, it won't make a difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2926.8s	2926.8	 Because with that extra 300, I think in federal state, federal unemployment, plus three to 700,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2934.9s	2934.9	 I think, depending on where you are, you're now at 60 7080%. And people are like, well, people will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2939.8s	2939.8	 still go to work. And it's like, yeah, but you're saving commuting, and you probably have side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2944.2s	2944.2	 hustles. And you've lowered your commute expense. So what is going to incentivize people to go back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2948.9s	2948.9	 to work, we are now running a dry run with cryptocurrency. And, you know, stimulus, a UBI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2955.7s	2955.7	 experiment. And the result of this UBI experiment is negative economic growth or throttled economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2963.2s	2963.2	 growth, we cannot be productive if people don't want to work and contribute. So just to your point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2968.1s	2968.1	 we need more people to go to work. So just your point on Friday, Montana, which was part of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2973.0s	2973.0	 federal government's, you know, pandemic related UI benefits program, basically said that we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2979.8s	2979.8	 canceling those benefits, and we're opting out. And on top of that, I think they're now offering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2984.2s	2984.2	 a $1,200 bonus to return to work. And the problem is because they Montana now has a severe labor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2990.4s	2990.4	 shortage. But it's not just Montana, it's every state in the union. So we have these two opposing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=2995.5s	2995.5	 forces, right? We have so much stimulus, we have an under motivated labor force, we have more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3003.1s	3003.1	 taxation, that's also just going to be wasted. So very poor ROI. And then now we have input costs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3009.1s	3009.1	 going up. And prices going up to try to attract people. It's it's all going to drive here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3015.3s	3015.3	 Here's the quote from the governor of Mississippi, the purpose of unemployment benefits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3019.0s	3019.0	 is to temporarily assist Mississippians who are unemployed through no fault of their own after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3023.9s	3023.9	 many conversations over the last several weeks with Mississippi small business owners and their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3028.1s	3028.1	 employees, it has become clear that the pandemic unemployment assistance, and other like programs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3032.8s	3032.8	 passed by the Congress may have been necessary in May of last year, but are no longer so in May of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3038.0s	3038.0	 this year. And can you imagine the hit you're going to take from voters from woke mobs from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3045.8s	3045.8	 people who believe in income inequality, when you say, I think we have to stop sending people free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3050.7s	3050.7	 money, so they go back to work like this is a very hard position to take. And we now have this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3057.0s	3057.0	 occurring on a micro basis in California, we have a is it true we have a $75 billion surplus this year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3064.4s	3064.4	 as the city devolves? Yeah, now we're going to take that. And instead of lowering taxes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3069.4s	3069.4	 and maybe trying to get Tesla or Oracle, or other venture capital firms that have left,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3075.3s	3075.3	 instead of doing that, what would be what would be what what could we do David with that 75?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3079.8s	3079.8	 Well, okay, so great point. So the $75 billion surplus, one third of that is a is from the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3084.6s	3084.6	 federal bailout, which obviously we don't need. And that's the money printing that's coming out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3088.4s	3088.4	 of Washington. We're giving that back right to another state. Good luck. Good luck. Exactly. No,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3093.0s	3093.0	 the other two thirds is because last year, we had all these unexpected tax receipts from the stock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3098.6s	3098.6	 market boom. And so you had all these California taxpayers paying capital gains on that. So but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3104.1s	3104.1	 what this highlights to me is and what I wonder about is how many of those taxpayers have left
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3108.6s	3108.6	 the state because we know that we had net migration loss of 182,000 in 2020. So how many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3115.3s	3115.3	 of those people left the state and won't be paying taxes this year? And if Biden breaks the stock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3120.6s	3120.6	 market through this insane tax and spend, then where is this like surplus going to come from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3125.0s	3125.0	 next year? And what this highlights to me is I think we have people in Washington and Sacramento
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3129.4s	3129.4	 for that matter, who've lost sight of the fact that ultimately, the private sector and the public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3135.0s	3135.0	 sector are a partnership because the private sector generates the largesse and the wealth to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3141.0s	3141.0	 fund the public sector and to fund the creation of these public goods, to fund education, to fund law
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3147.8s	3147.8	 and order, to fund social programs. And they've stopped seeing it that way. They see the private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3153.3s	3153.3	 sector not as something like a cow to be milked or a sheep to be sheared, but they want to skin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3162.1s	3162.1	 the sheep instead of shearing it. And so they're really at risk of killing the golden goose. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3169.5s	3169.5	 guess you could put it that way. And I think that during the Clinton years, just to take a contrast,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3177.8s	3177.8	 we had a federal government spending as a percent of GDP was between 8.5% and 22%. That was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3186.2s	3186.2	 range and we had a boom. So when you have a federal spending as a percentage of GDP around 20%,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3193.3s	3193.3	 it works, right? And that doesn't mean you can't increase government spending. It just means that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3197.4s	3197.4	 government spending will increase as the economy gets bigger. But what you have now is federal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3201.8s	3201.8	 spending over 30% of GDP, and everything is starting to break. That's the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3207.5s	3207.5	 Very, very big problem. And of course,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3210.7s	3210.7	 and that's why we're all getting redpilled, right? How many people in Silicon Valley,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3214.1s	3214.1	 frankly, who make a living off growth stocks are now starting to scratch their heads going, gee,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3218.6s	3218.6	 what did I vote for? It's definitely becoming a thing. And I would say the purple pill party,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3226.2s	3226.2	 you know, like chop it up. Let's mix these two things. Let's candy flip, whatever it takes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3230.5s	3230.5	 like to get out of this, you know, we got to get this party restarted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3234.2s	3234.2	 Centrism is the answer. It absolutely is. And you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3237.3s	3237.3	 Centrism is the answer. I think it's probably good for us to take a pause here and maybe talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3243.2s	3243.2	 about this business insider hit piece, or what was likely to be a hit piece. But turned out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3248.6s	3248.6	 I think, on a margin fair, calling this all in podcast, and I didn't don't know if this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3255.9s	3255.9	 is accurate, but I thought it was pretty funny. Possibly the single most disruptive click
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3262.1s	3262.1	 in California politics this year, I think they're referring to the four of us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3267.1s	3267.1	 And then of course, I get absolutely skewered for making clucking noises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3272.8s	3272.8	 I own those clucks. I'm proud of those clucks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3278.7s	3278.7	 Here's what I'll say. Can I say something? I think that, look, our, I don't know, I'm a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3286.2s	3286.2	 exhausted about local politics and California politics. I'm not exhausted by federal politics,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3293.1s	3293.1	 because I think it's an important lens, as David said, into like how we actually conduct business,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3300.2s	3300.2	 because all of the businesses we're involved with are inherently global and America leads.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3306.6s	3306.6	 Here's what I'll say though about about that article, which I didn't read.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3310.5s	3310.5	 Like most of these things, which I don't really read.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3313.4s	3313.4	 Never read your press rule number one in the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3316.7s	3316.7	 I think it's incredibly important to realize that California was a bellwether for opportunity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3325.2s	3325.2	 and the ideals of American upward mobility. And a lot of people came here irrespective of the taxes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3333.7s	3333.7	 because they sought out like minded people, they sought out a moderate liberal, liberal viewpoint,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3341.3s	3341.3	 and an economic set of opportunities. Two of those three boundary conditions are changing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3348.8s	3348.8	 And that's why I think California is now important, because it is a canary in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3353.3s	3353.3	 coal mine for the rest of the United States, which is, do we become a Balkanized country of 50 states?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3360.1s	3360.1	 Or are there like generic, progressive, moderate ideals that everybody can agree to and sign up to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3366.5s	3366.5	 and where governments largely still get out of the way this, like, I don't think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3372.2s	3372.2	 you know, if you look at sort of like tech oligopolists, and the hatred we have for them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3377.1s	3377.1	 I don't think political oligopolists are any better. And so, you know, I don't think we want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3382.5s	3382.5	 either of them in charge is really the answer. And so, we just, we just got to use this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3391.2s	3391.2	 election cycle, I think, to kind of like, vote a moderate agenda, the most disruptive thing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3397.5s	3397.5	 can happen in California is somebody emerges who is rational and moderate, who says, you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3404.0s	3404.0	 categorize me as a Republican or Democrat on a whole bunch of issues. I had to pick a platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3409.3s	3409.3	 because the stupid election model makes me pick one. So call me a Democrat or call me a Republican,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3414.2s	3414.2	 but the reality is I'm a centrist. Here's what I believe. And if that person gets voted in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3419.7s	3419.7	 then hopefully it changes the conversation for the rest of the country. Otherwise, we are headed to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3425.7s	3425.7	 50 Balkanized states operating independently. And Jason, the thing where you make a joke
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3430.7s	3430.7	 is actually kind of sad. If you get $25 billion, and you don't need it. The ideal thing is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3436.3s	3436.3	 you actually give it back to the federal government because you think there's some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3439.0s	3439.0	 accountability for all these dollars and it actually is the right thing to do. And the fact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3442.6s	3442.6	 that everybody laughs because we know, of course that we'd rather just dig a ditch and fill a ditch

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3454.0s	3454.0	 That's kind of sad. And so that's all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3455.8s	3455.8	 It's sad and it's corrupt, right? It's a corruption. It's a corruption that we've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3459.6s	3459.6	 just gotten used to, which is you're going to take $26 billion that you don't need, that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3463.7s	3463.7	 don't deserve. It's like the school board in San Francisco announcing they're going to open school
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3468.5s	3468.5	 for one day to qualify for incentives for reopening that Gavin Newsom gave him for 12 million bucks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3473.8s	3473.8	 It's a pure money grab. It's outrageous, you know? It's all about the Benjamins for these guys. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3480.6s	3480.6	 by that, I do not mean students named Benjamin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3484.9s	3484.9	 Wow, there you go, folks. David Sacks punching it up on the next session now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3488.2s	3488.2	 I wonder why you like to invite you to come with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3492.7s	3492.7	 I'm not as good as you, Jason. I'm going to stick with my day job. But let me, can we go back to this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3497.6s	3497.6	 article? I want to give you my two cents on this article. I did, you know, it was behind a paywall,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3502.8s	3502.8	 so it was hard to read, but I got a copy of it. Here's my view on it. First of all, I think they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3507.0s	3507.0	 did pull their punches a little bit because we did the pre-buttle, you know, we called them out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3510.7s	3510.7	 before based on their very biased list of questions they sent me. But in any event, they kind of pulled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3515.4s	3515.4	 their punches a little bit, but the article was kind of suffused with this, how dare they pissiness,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3521.4s	3521.4	 and in a couple of areas. One was, you know, the reporter was very upset that we're going direct,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3526.5s	3526.5	 right? We've talked about going direct, meaning going around reporters and speaking directly to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3531.4s	3531.4	 the public. It's kind of, well, how dare they do that? You know, they should be talking through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3535.4s	3535.4	 us, you know, we the objective reporters, and then we'll tell the story for them. No,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3540.6s	3540.6	 we're going direct. We want to have an influence. We want to speak our minds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3544.6s	3544.6	 And the second thing they're upset about is the fact that we're contributing to these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3548.5s	3548.5	 elections. And the reporter made a point of saying that I sought out the Boudin recall,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3553.8s	3553.8	 they didn't just come to me, I sought them out and wrote $25,000 as if what is he really up to?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3559.2s	3559.2	 Why did he seek them out? Well, if you want to know what I'm up to, I've written about it. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3564.0s	3564.0	 wrote a blog on, you know, the problem of Chase and Boudin. I've written a blog on the on how Gavin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3568.9s	3568.9	 Newsom has moved very far to the left. You don't need to speculate or wonder what I'm up to. I've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3573.7s	3573.7	 spent thousands of words, yeah, but here's the problem, David. David, they want you to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3579.9s	3579.9	 through them. Exactly. And the fact that this podcast has bigger reach than when we go on CNBC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3586.5s	3586.5	 or bigger reach than we're in Business Insider. And you know, when the New Yorker article on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3591.5s	3591.5	 Chamath comes out, more people will listen to this podcast and read that article.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3597.0s	3597.0	 That's what this is about. Yes, absolutely. There's a certain threatening nature to what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3601.0s	3601.0	 we're doing here where, you know, as they admit, we're more influential than they are, well, then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3606.3s	3606.3	 why read them? Like, what is the point, especially if they're doing link baiting, they look even,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3610.6s	3610.6	 they look dumb when compared to the dialogue we're having here, they can't have the dialogue we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3615.2s	3615.2	 having here. Because let's face it, we're we're for insiders, we see the what's happening on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3620.8s	3620.8	 inside. And if we talk to them, they might get 10 or 20% of the picture. And in aggregate, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3626.8s	3626.8	 might get to 50 or 60. But we get 100%. Let me connect a couple dots, because I think what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3632.0s	3632.0	 you're saying is is really important. In my mind, I think this is another example of like the CDC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3638.6s	3638.6	 example, or the financial markets example, where, in all in all of these cases, what we have is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3645.0s	3645.0	 following dynamic, which is, like, if you think about when the newspaper used to hit your front
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3650.4s	3650.4	 door, right, like you used to wake up and you know, when the paper was delivered, right, we all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3654.2s	3654.2	 remember that. And you'd pick it up. And it was a physical paper. Now I'm just going to use it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3660.3s	3660.3	 this number to make it to make an example, let's just say it was eight and a half by 11.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3664.7s	3664.7	 You take this eight and a half by 11 piece of paper, and what you have is a fixed container.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3670.7s	3670.7	 And so what there was was inherent competition. And so inherently, you had this leverage where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3677.0s	3677.0	 it was only the best things that got into the paper, right? They segregated by sections,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3682.1s	3682.1	 people wanted to advertise against it. And having a fixed amount of real estate really made that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3688.4s	3688.4	 real estate precious. And I think that that was really, really important. Now think about what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3692.6s	3692.6	 happened. When you go to that same paper online, let's just use the New York Times. Effectively,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3698.8s	3698.8	 that container has become infinite. And so now you've completely taken away the ability for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3704.3s	3704.3	 anybody to actually assign real value, there's no above the masthead or above the fold concept as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3710.6s	3710.6	 much as there used to be, especially in infinite scrolling. The point of all of this is this is why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3716.1s	3716.1	 there's no value in coming back and re you know, telling the truth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3720.1s	3720.1	 You just go to the next clickbait title, because you're just keep on going and going and you just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3724.2s	3724.2	 wonder, hey, wait a minute to tell the truth is an inconvenient artifact of my business model today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3729.4s	3729.4	 Whereas before telling the truth was really important. It was an anchor which created more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3733.6s	3733.6	 value for you to sell ads. Now it's just, it just gets lost in a sea of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3738.0s	3738.0	 There's such an agenda.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3739.4s	3739.4	 So the point is, the financial markets in this interesting way is the only or it's one of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3744.2s	3744.2	 few places left, where you can vote in real time about the truth. Right. And so for example, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3751.8s	3751.8	 you know, you get all of these readings, and you get all of these documents from the Fed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3755.8s	3755.8	 which is the financial markets version of the CDC. But you can vote that you don't believe them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3762.2s	3762.2	 And you can see it every day the gap between what they say is narrative and what the facts are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3767.2s	3767.2	 And that's a really healthy dynamic that still exists in in finance and capital markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3772.4s	3772.4	 We just need to figure out a way where it exists everywhere else. Otherwise,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3776.4s	3776.4	 people will always want to make sure that they have a direct conduit to tell their version of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3782.2s	3782.2	 the truth and allow people to decide for themselves. Before we get to science with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3787.4s	3787.4	 Friedberg, if you get this camera back up and running, I don't know if you guys know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3790.5s	3790.5	 but Vox canceled us this week with an assist from Taylor Lorenz. The funniest story is turned in all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3796.3s	3796.3	 of this is the multimillionaire VCs cooperating the language of young women, MLM marketers in an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3801.8s	3801.8	 effort to seem cool and hip with us. Why white men are using the term besties. I don't know if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3807.8s	3807.8	 saw that. I think I think Taylor Lorenz has had her sense of humor surgically removed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3813.5s	3813.5	 I mean, doesn't the Internet monitor doesn't Yeah, doesn't she understand that this is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3819.7s	3819.7	 self deprecating self mocking bit that we came up with or that you came up with? I mean, come on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3825.7s	3825.7	 it's a gag. We know it's funny for 50 year old guys to be calling each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3830.9s	3830.9	 The reason why, by the way, just if everybody wants to know the origin of that is one of our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3835.0s	3835.0	 other friends, Phil Helmuth kept calling me bestie C and we used to think it was the dumbest thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3841.8s	3841.8	 that we've ever heard. And then what we thought was would be even funnier is to just co-opt it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3846.4s	3846.4	 And it was credit to book but it was done initially to make fun of what how Muth used to call me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3853.2s	3853.2	 Right. Well, help me with actually has the maturity level of a teenage girl. So that's true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3859.2s	3859.2	 That's true with the name dropping. I don't I when he used to term bestie,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3863.1s	3863.1	 he was not using it ironically. We're using it ironically. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, let's talk a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3869.9s	3869.9	 little bit about science so we can keep the Friedberg ratio up for all these Friedberg stands,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3873.8s	3873.8	 including the whichever maniac is running Friedberg's dogs, anonymous Twitter handle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3878.7s	3878.7	 I don't know if you talked to Twitter security about that yet. Friedberg,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3881.5s	3881.5	 my dog's on a walk right now. He'll come back and then he can tweet later as well. It is my it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3885.7s	3885.7	 my dog that runs the the account. Yeah, so much for our ratings. No, what is your dog's name again?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3891.3s	3891.3	 Monte Monte Montgomery Wiggins with no Montgomery. This this is going to be lowest lowest episode in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3897.5s	3897.5	 a long time. But his name was was Wiggins at the SPCA where I adopted him from. And I and I wanted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3904.0s	3904.0	 to name him Monte because he's like a hustler. He hustled his way, you know, from the streets of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3908.8s	3908.8	 mission into a nice condo in Pack Heights. So I gave him the full name Montgomery. So he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3913.3s	3913.3	 Montgomery Wiggins now. Oh, here he is. Monte, come here. Come on. Come on. Come on, D. Come on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3918.8s	3918.8	 Monte. Okay, tweet something ironic. There he goes. Hey, there's a lot going on with synthetic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3925.6s	3925.6	 biology. We saw two different IPOs in I believe the last month or so. Tell us about the the gink

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3944.6s	3944.6	 biology, which dates back, you know, many years, right? Genentech is one of the first companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3951.8s	3951.8	 to effectively use synthetic biology to to make products. So you know, Genentech and Amgen started
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3959.6s	3959.6	 making these proteins that that became biologic drugs. And the way you you can kind of think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3965.5s	3965.5	 about synthetic biology is the DNA is software and we can program the software to get the organism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3972.6s	3972.6	 of the you know, whatever DNA we're changing to make something that we want to use. And so synthetic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3979.1s	3979.1	 biology is all about editing the genome or editing the DNA of an organism, editing its DNA, and doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3985.7s	3985.7	 that in a way that you can kind of make a product. And so this was done initially for biologic drugs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3991.0s	3991.0	 And over the last kind of 20 years or so, using synthetic biology as a as a kind of approach,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=3997.4s	3997.4	 we've kind of thought about, well, how can we make things like fuel and increasingly more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4001.6s	4001.6	 commoditized products like, you know, proteins that we might consume for animal consumption,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4007.3s	4007.3	 instead of using animals to make proteins. And so the underlying technologies have all followed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4014.2s	4014.2	 an accelerated path that's greater than Moore's law. You know, DNA sequencing costs have dropped
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4018.9s	4018.9	 faster than Moore's law over the last 10 or 15 years, the ability to synthesize or print DNA,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4024.3s	4024.3	 CRISPR, you know, kind of provides us with a set of tools to do much more precise DNA editing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4029.6s	4029.6	 and so on and so forth. And there's just a confluence of technologies, sort of like there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4034.1s	4034.1	 were leading up to the personal computing revolution, that are now going to enable this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4039.9s	4039.9	 incredible proliferation of a new industry that many argue will rewrite all industrial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4047.2s	4047.2	 systems, all industry that makes everything that humans consume from materials, to food,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4052.6s	4052.6	 to the chemicals, to the plastics, everything that we use in our daily life can be rewritten
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4057.8s	4057.8	 using synthetic biology. And so the promise of this dates back, again, like two decades or so,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4062.5s	4062.5	 there was a company called Amaris that John Dorback, that was one of the first companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4066.4s	4066.4	 that was one of the few companies from the original synthetic biology companies that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4069.6s	4069.6	 actually survived and made it through. And they're still around, they're still a publicly traded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4073.1s	4073.1	 company. And more recently, there have been these kind of more digitally enabled, at least that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4078.3s	4078.3	 the premise that they kind of make for what for their businesses, companies. So Zymurgen, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4082.8s	4082.8	 was, you know, got a bunch of soft bank money, they raised a billion dollars as a private company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4087.5s	4087.5	 They got public with like, I think, 13 or 14 million of revenue, and they're worth $5 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4093.0s	4093.0	 in their IPO. So they just went public. And this other company called Ginkgo Bioworks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4098.3s	4098.3	 which is a similar sort of, you know, synthetic biology platform company just went public,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4103.0s	4103.0	 or just announced that they're going public via SPAC at a $15 billion market cap with, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4108.3s	4108.3	 I think less than 100 million in revenue. So, you know, the game is on. And I think one way to kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4113.9s	4113.9	 of think about this is these businesses aren't great businesses today. But the promise of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4121.0s	4121.0	 next century being all about synthetic biology, you know, where biology becomes software, and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4126.6s	4126.6	 can program biological organisms to make and print pretty much anything we as humans consume, is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4132.4s	4132.4	 premise that everyone believes is going to come to fruition this century. And it will completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4136.6s	4136.6	 reinvent industry will improve sustainability, I think it is going to be the great savior for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4140.6s	4140.6	 this planet, and for our ability to sustain on this planet. So these are kind of, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4144.8s	4144.8	 two big IPOs that validate that the capital markets are there. There's so many big institutional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4149.6s	4149.6	 investors to not can share more on this that are like backing, quote unquote, ESG companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4153.7s	4153.7	 synthetic biology is this kind of ESG, you know, moment. And, and I think these two IPOs happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4160.8s	4160.8	 at the valuations that they're happening at and the capital that's going in, I think these are kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4164.4s	4164.4	 of like the Netscape moments for synthetic biology, and we're going to see a tremendous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4167.9s	4167.9	 amount happen over the next couple of years. So Chamath, how close are these from being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4172.0s	4172.0	 science projects in a lab to being scalable revenue companies in your estimation, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4177.3s	4177.3	 these are de minimis amounts of capital we're talking about. So this feels like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4181.0s	4181.0	 de minimis amounts of revenue, de minimis amounts of revenue, large amounts of capital, is this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4187.2s	4187.2	 is this? How far is it to actually cross that chasm? We, I think that we're still trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4194.6s	4194.6	 figure out what the right business model for these companies is. So for example, like if you look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4200.3s	4200.3	 chip design, right, like, so there's an entire value chain where there's the people that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4205.4s	4205.4	 manufacture the equipment, right, there's the people that run the factory, there are the people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4210.6s	4210.6	 that develop the tool chain, so the software that you can use to characterize and build a chip,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4215.9s	4215.9	 right. And if you look at those industries, the factory in the middle tends to be the least
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4221.0s	4221.0	 valuable. Companies like Verilog, you know, folks that make the software are really important,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4226.8s	4226.8	 and then folks that make the equipment because the equipment is so precise and very complicated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4231.0s	4231.0	 is valuable. If you translate that to biology, we need to sort out where the value is going to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4236.9s	4236.9	 So the amazing thing about Ginkgo is what its promise is, what the promise that they,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4242.6s	4242.6	 that they're going to make to the market is we're going to make biology programmable so that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4249.9s	4249.9	 the, an entire generation of biologists and chemists who would otherwise have not been able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4255.4s	4255.4	 to just actually literally like write into a command line interface and generate biologic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4261.9s	4261.9	 samples, we're going to be able to enable that the same way an electrical engineer, so like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4265.3s	4265.3	 you know, for example, like, you know, when I was doing internships, or you would literally be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4269.7s	4269.7	 writing Verilog, and it would get, you know, basically generating what was called a netlist,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4274.1s	4274.1	 and you could send a netlist to a fab and all of a sudden out comes a chip. So that's what we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4278.6s	4278.6	 trying to do. The problem that they have to figure out now is, are you a tool provider?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4285.1s	4285.1	 Are you, you know, picking shovels? Are you doing it yourself on balance sheet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4289.6s	4289.6	 Are you a product company? Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4291.0s	4291.0	 Are you a product company? And this is where we're too early to know what the answer is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4295.9s	4295.9	 But as the market sorts that out, as David said, more people will get comfortable applying money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4302.5s	4302.5	 This is why Zymurgen and Ginkgo are two really important data points, because as David said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4309.1s	4309.1	 it will force the market to help these companies rationalize where they are and what the tool chain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4318.6s	4318.6	 looks like and compare it to semiconductors. And in that you're going to have an entire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4324.2s	4324.2	 generation of companies get built. It's super exciting. I spent time in and around these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4330.1s	4330.1	 businesses without getting too specific. And I think they're really compelling, really interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4334.6s	4334.6	 This is, I mean, I never, I don't generally speak my book, but this is where I spend most of my time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4340.2s	4340.2	 right? So I really am making a bet on my career and my capital and my time on synthetic biology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4348.4s	4348.4	 and the opportunity it presents for our species this century. So all of the work I do, and I have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4354.6s	4354.6	 several businesses that I would say compete with Ginkgo and Zymurgen in different ways and are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4358.4s	4358.4	 tacking this problem in different ways, which is, I mentioned this last time, but how do you produce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4363.4s	4363.4	 enough biological material? How do you make stuff? Go fermenters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4369.4s	4369.4	 So are there fermenter tank companies? Are there cheap fermentation platform companies?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4374.9s	4374.9	 Do we need to scale these things up? Do we need to reinvent how they're operating? There's a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4379.0s	4379.0	 of stuff we need to figure out over the next couple of years for this to really sweep the world. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4384.3s	4384.3	 the fact that we can program biology to make stuff for us is where we're at today. That's the moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4389.7s	4389.7	 So here's another example of a fabulous company. This is a private company, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4395.0s	4395.0	 you'll see them in the next probably three or four years debut as a public business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4399.9s	4399.9	 called PivotBio, another synthetic biology company, which I think is just masterful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4404.6s	4404.6	 And what essentially PivotBio does, it essentially is a clean alternative to synthetic nitrogen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4411.0s	4411.0	 fertilizer. So you put this shit in the ground when you're planting seeds. And what it enables is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4417.3s	4417.3	 plants that were previously incapable of nitrogen fixation, meaning getting nitrogen out of the soil,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4423.4s	4423.4	 they're able to do it. Now all of a sudden yields go up, density goes up, predictability of the crops
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4428.1s	4428.1	 go up. And it's a huge advance for farming. What's interesting about, you know, so PivotBio,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4434.1s	4434.1	 like Chamath mentioned, there's a lot of plants like soybeans, legumes that will fix nitrogen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4438.6s	4438.6	 they'll take nitrogen out of the air, right? Most 70% of the air is nitrogen. And so plants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4443.2s	4443.2	 need nitrogen to grow, all protein has to have nitrogen in it. So nitrogen is key to growing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4447.5s	4447.5	 plants. Corn, you need to put nitrogen on the ground. So around 6% of global electricity is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4454.6s	4454.6	 used to make ammonia, which is the fertilizer that farmers around the world put on their fields to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4465.0s	4465.0	 turns into nitrous oxide, which is a 300x worth greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Think about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4471.1s	4471.1	 that 300x the heat capacity of carbon dioxide when it goes up into the atmosphere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4476.3s	4476.3	 So the environmental effects of nitrogen based agriculture are awful. And you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4481.2s	4481.2	 pivot is one of the first, they actually commercialized a research microbial strain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4485.1s	4485.1	 to do this. And you put it on the seed before you put it on the ground. But now the ability for us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4489.2s	4489.2	 to engineer microbes, and the microbes now pull the nitrogen out of the air and stick it into the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4493.4s	4493.4	 plant. The ability for us to engineer microbes opens up this universe of possibility where pivot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4498.3s	4498.3	 is kind of like, you know, kindergarten level of what's going to happen over the next couple years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4502.2s	4502.2	 where we can now engineer all these microbes to pull nitrogen out of the atmosphere,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4505.8s	4505.8	 and maybe reduce all fertilizer use and have a huge effect on greenhouse gas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4509.8s	4509.8	 resulting from from from from agriculture. A lot of what you've mentioned seems to be things in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4515.4s	4515.4	 world, products that can be improved and refined. What about inside of our bodies? I know there are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4521.9s	4521.9	 some efforts to understand what cells are doing and maybe use synthetic biology to get a reading
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4528.1s	4528.1	 on a molecular or cellular level as to what is going on inside your body. And then there are these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4532.7s	4532.7	 self replicating systems that might be able to, you know, I don't know if your white blood cells
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4537.0s	4537.0	 were low, you know, and it was the 80s. And it was HIV, you could just boom produce more white sub
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4541.5s	4541.5	 blood cells with a shot or something. Well, the original idea of Moderna, which we all know now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4547.3s	4547.3	 is being kind of this RNA vaccine producer was you could put RNA in your body and therefore provide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4551.8s	4551.8	 the code to get yourself to make specific proteins that can do things in your body. And so we did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4557.1s	4557.1	 this example. Well, the example we're using now is the COVID vaccine, right? So it makes the COVID
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4561.8s	4561.8	 the spike protein, which we then develop an immune response to. But the idea with Moderna is you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4566.6s	4566.6	 could eventually replace medicine with these RNA shots. And now your cells can start to make specific
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4572.6s	4572.6	 proteins to do specific things in your body. Now, we're very elementary as a species in our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4576.9s	4576.9	 understanding of how proteins drive systems level biology and outcomes. So we're starting to learn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4581.9s	4581.9	 about this. But I will tell you there's a really interesting research team at UCSF led by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4587.9s	4587.9	 a woman named Hannah El-Samid. And this research team is identifying, they're building a toolkit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4594.2s	4594.2	 of proteins, where these proteins can almost have like robotic arms, they can have really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4599.7s	4599.7	 interesting function. Think about Martin Short in Inner Space. Remember that machine he went in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4603.3s	4603.3	 he went in the body and he started doing stuff in the body. They're working on building basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4607.0s	4607.0	 a toolkit. So it's not just a single protein that now you it goes and does something, but really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4611.5s	4611.5	 complicated combinations of proteins that can now go in the body and fix things and repair things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4616.0s	4616.0	 and, and react environmentally to specific conditions in the body, like, oh, there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4620.2s	4620.2	 cancer cell here, I'm going to go do something to it now. And so there's this whole there's this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4624.5s	4624.5	 whole world of like dynamic, you know, kind of making things more dynamical than they have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4628.2s	4628.2	 historically. Just just thinking about aging, would it theoretically be able to help with hearing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4633.6s	4633.6	 loss, eyesight loss, you know, and those type of things? Would you be able to there's another area
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4639.3s	4639.3	 of biology, we could talk about this at length, but there's another biology called stem cell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4642.7s	4642.7	 therapy, where you can basically take you know, all cells evolve from stem cells in your body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4647.6s	4647.6	 So these are kind of the original cells that you have initially in an embryo, right? And then,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4651.8s	4651.8	 as your body kind of grows, you end up with these stem cells, and you have stem cells in your body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4655.6s	4655.6	 today. Those stem cells, when they make a copy, they can differentiate into different cells in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4660.3s	4660.3	 your body. So for the last, you know, 10, 20 years in California, by the way, has about a $4 billion,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4665.6s	4665.6	 if I remember right, stem cell grant program, where they're funding research into stem cell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4670.2s	4670.2	 therapies. So there are significantly successful therapies right now. Multiple companies are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4678.2s	4678.2	 productizing and launching and they're already active in the market for fixing blindness with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4682.7s	4682.7	 people that have specific diseases called retinitis pigmentosa, where you're the retinal cells in your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4687.8s	4687.8	 body in your eyes degrade and stop working, you will get a stem cell injection of progenitor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4693.4s	4693.4	 retinal stem cells into your eye, and you will grow a new retina and you can see again. And the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4698.2s	4698.2	 efficacy is insane. It is incredible how well this works. And they are doing this with lots of other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4703.7s	4703.7	 stem cell therapies. So we're getting so smart. And here's an incredible thing scientists discovered
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4708.6s	4708.6	 a few years ago. And I think these guys won the Nobel Prize for this. You could take any cell in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4711.5s	4711.5	 the human body and induce it chemically, meaning you put a bunch of chemicals on that cell,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4716.7s	4716.7	 and get that cell to convert back into a stem cell. Now you've created your own stem cells from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4722.4s	4722.4	 your own body, and you can now put them back in your body and get them to turn into any other cell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4726.2s	4726.2	 in your body. So this is called induced pluripotent stem cell therapy, IPSC. So IPSC now forms the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4732.4s	4732.4	 basis for a lot of these stem cell therapy kind of programs that are underway. And so this is going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4737.8s	4737.8	 to be an insane field over the next couple of decades. Hey, Friedberg, if we took the $25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4743.3s	4743.3	 billion that we don't need in California and gave it to these companies, how quickly could we survive?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4747.8s	4747.8	 Totally. How quickly could we solve this problem? Nothing drives me more nuts than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4752.3s	4752.3	 when I see money not going to science. I mean, it is just nuts. I mean, seriously, like let's,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4756.7s	4756.7	 we need to start our own political party that is based on reasonable suggestions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4762.6s	4762.6	 like the one I just made or the ones, you know, the middle ground party, just a reasonable party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4768.9s	4768.9	 Sax, do you think there's possibility for a third, for a true third party in the United States?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4774.3s	4774.3	 Structurally, no, it's really set up to be a two party system. You have to really take over one of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4778.8s	4778.8	 the two parties. And frankly, the problem in our politics right now, I'm not saying the Republican
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4783.1s	4783.1	 party is great, but the Democrat party has basically been taken over by woke socialists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4787.5s	4787.5	 So, you know, but so I think that kind of like limits your options. But I mean, what you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4795.1s	4795.1	 to do is create a movement and then you you basically take over one of the parties.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4799.3s	4799.3	 Right. I mean, what we're describing today, I mean, just to up level it is, it almost feels like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4803.8s	4803.8	 we're in a race between technological acceleration and social and political deterioration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4810.4s	4810.4	 Right. So like technology, we're in a race, I think, for the future between technological
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4817.1s	4817.1	 acceleration and social and political deterioration. And the question is, which one of these forces is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4822.3s	4822.3	 going to win the future? Everything Friedberg described is incredibly hopeful, right? We're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4826.1s	4826.1	 going to be able to cure people with all these miracle technologies. I mean, even the new MRNA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4831.0s	4831.0	 vaccines that were developed for COVID. I mean, it's miraculous, right? And we're going to be able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4834.7s	4834.7	 to use that same MRNA technology for other things, other diseases, maybe even to attack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4839.9s	4839.9	 cancer cells. So there's so many positive things happening. We all see it in the technology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4844.4s	4844.4	 ecosystem. There's been an explosion of wealth creation and opportunity created over the last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4849.8s	4849.8	 20 years in technology. And so we have this very positive force. And then everything that seems to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4855.4s	4855.4	 be happening in our politics and society is negative. It's involved deterioration. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4861.9s	4861.9	 basically a special interest corruption. It's basically people wedded to these insane ideologies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4870.6s	4870.6	 And you're right. What we really want is just a pragmatic party that allows the private sector
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4877.1s	4877.1	 to do its job, generate the wealth necessary to then fund social programs, instead of trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4882.2s	4882.2	 upturn the whole system, which is what it feels like so many people in power are trying to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4887.2s	4887.2	 today. Yeah. So I registered reason party for us if we ever want to go there. So if you want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4895.4s	4895.4	 bookmark reason party. Let's talk about this tonight, boys, because I got to run. Oh, is it on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0iWGNXKXw&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=104&t=4903.0s	4903.0	 Yum yum. I'm going to see two of you tonight. I cannot wait. Sax, you got to fly up. You got to
