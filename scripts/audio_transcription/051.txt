https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=357.6s	357.6	 Kind of contractions and expansions and that this is just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=360.6s	360.6	 the thing that needs to get work through the system as we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=363.3s	363.3	 readjust to a post COVID world, blah, blah, blah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=366.3s	366.3	 I think it's different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=367.6s	367.6	 And the reason I think it's different is if you just look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=371.8s	371.8	 one thing and one thing only, which is that we have a massive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=375.9s	375.9	 labor shortage in America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=378.6s	378.6	 And there is an incredible stat that I saw, which was the average
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=383.1s	383.1	 hourly earnings of non manager people in hospitality and travel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=389.0s	389.0	 And the average salary, the mean salary was around 20 some odd
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=391.9s	391.9	 dollars an hour, and it's now 33 bucks an hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=396.2s	396.2	 And so what that to me says is that we are going through a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=401.2s	401.2	 really sustained period where you cannot get people to do the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=404.7s	404.7	 work that needs to get done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=407.2s	407.2	 Biden had to call the port of LA, which is a very, very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=411.2s	411.2	 Biden had to call the port of LA and try to get these guys to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=415.0s	415.0	 open 24 hours a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=416.2s	416.2	 The president of the United States is calling a local port, trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=419.9s	419.9	 get it to stay open.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=421.6s	421.6	 But why can't they stay open?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=422.9s	422.9	 Because you have long Sherman, you have all these unionized folks who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=425.5s	425.5	 will expect to get certain levels of compensation, which they deserve in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=429.2s	429.2	 order to do that work 24 seven.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=431.2s	431.2	 But then all of that is going to get put through the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=434.5s	434.5	 And if you still have millions of jobs that needs to get done in order for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=438.0s	438.0	 the economy to function, the only efficient way that that's going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=441.3s	441.3	 get resolved is by raising salaries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=443.9s	443.9	 And those are consistent and persistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=447.0s	447.0	 Those things are not just like, oh, you know what I gave?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=449.2s	449.2	 Yes, I did say 50 bucks an hour, but now I'm taking you back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=451.5s	451.5	 You can't take that back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=452.6s	452.6	 That's going to be that's so I'm so I tend to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=455.4s	455.4	 So that's one thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=456.4s	456.4	 And then second, so there's people, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=459.3s	459.3	 So labor capital, I just think it's getting more and more expensive to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=462.0s	462.0	 get folks to do work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=463.7s	463.7	 And then there's the raw materials that you use to make anything and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=467.3s	467.3	 everything that I see is that stuff is going bananas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=471.0s	471.0	 And so I put these two things together and I'm like, I think this stuff is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=474.2s	474.2	 here to stay. I'm really kind of a little bit of a you know, and I and I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=478.6s	478.6	 had not worried and you can see in every episode before this, I was always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=481.8s	481.8	 consistently like, there is no inflation, you can fade the inflation trade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=486.6s	486.6	 Now I'm kind of positioning myself to hedge myself in this situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=491.9s	491.9	 All right, freeburg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=493.2s	493.2	 We've seen the pictures of the Long Beach and the Los Angeles ports, there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=499.8s	499.8	 just ships out there, like, I think 70 or 80 is where it peaked at in July, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=505.3s	505.3	 don't know, have the latest data here of when it updated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=508.6s	508.6	 But is there not a silver lining here that if people are making more money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=513.2s	513.2	 then we're going to increase the size of the middle class and we're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=516.4s	516.4	 you know, increase upward mobility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=518.6s	518.6	 And that is a double edged sword.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=521.0s	521.0	 It's great that we increase the middle class, but then they're going to want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=523.6s	523.6	 to buy stuff. So people are now making 35 bucks an hour and they were making 20.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=528.1s	528.1	 Now they got more disposable. Now they're going to go on Amazon and buy more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=530.5s	530.5	 stuff. And it's going to accelerate this problem. Is it not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=533.3s	533.3	 The challenge is the rate of change. This is what the Fed tries to manage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=537.7s	537.7	 And you know, there's a White House Economic Advisory Committee that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=540.5s	540.5	 involved in trying to figure out what's going to happen here. Because the current
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=543.6s	543.6	 estimate is it's going to take at least a year or probably a year to work through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=547.6s	547.6	 the current logjam in the global supply chains.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=550.6s	550.6	 And during that period of time, as Shamak points out, what's happening is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=556.6s	556.6	 The cost for goods is climbing because people have to charge more because there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=562.5s	562.5	 limited inventory and people are bidding up the value of that inventory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=566.3s	566.3	 As they do that, the businesses end up needing to get more labor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=571.2s	571.2	 And so they have to pay more to hire people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=573.0s	573.0	 If they pay more to hire people, those people end up demanding more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=576.8s	576.8	 And the cycle can actually go the wrong direction where you have an inflationary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=580.7s	580.7	 spike that persists. How do you taper that inflation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=583.7s	583.7	 It's not necessarily great for economic growth if you can't produce the stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=587.2s	587.2	 And it can actually cause these runaway kind of effects in the dynamic system of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=591.0s	591.0	 supply and demand when you have these these things clogging up the system for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=595.5s	595.5	 supply. So so it is a real risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=599.2s	599.2	 And it is the biggest thing that, you know, the White House, this economic task
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=603.5s	603.5	 force is kind of trying to figure out right now is where's the balance lie where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=607.8s	607.8	 you can basically try and taper this inflationary effect that's being caused by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=612.5s	612.5	 this logjam in the supply chain without causing economic disruption by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=617.3s	617.3	 rising it by raising interest rates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=619.7s	619.7	 And so it's a really kind of complicated second and third derivative formula that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=624.0s	624.0	 needs to kind of be resolved. And that's why so many of these little elements are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=626.7s	626.7	 so important to get right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=627.8s	627.8	 By the way, rates, by the way, central bankers around the world have raised rates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=630.8s	630.8	 The only place that hasn't gone up is Europe, ECB and the United States, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=634.0s	634.0	 Federal Reserve. So and let's be honest, you know, Europe and the United States,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=639.4s	639.4	 we absorb labor and materials from all around the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=642.4s	642.4	 Right. We are the net importers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=644.5s	644.5	 We are the net ultimate buyers of last resort of all of these things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=647.3s	647.3	 And so if you're seeing inflation in those other, you know, supply driven
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=651.2s	651.2	 economies, they are going to come on shore. They're going to hit us in the face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=654.6s	654.6	 I think prices are going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=656.9s	656.9	 The other the other free market argument that could be made is that these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=662.5s	662.5	 these current trends will accelerate a trend towards more automation of low cost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=668.4s	668.4	 labor because it now will make sense for businesses to invest in the capital in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=674.1s	674.1	 the capex, in the infrastructure and ultimately for technology companies to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=678.0s	678.0	 build that, that tooling to support that infrastructure that will automate jobs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=683.6s	683.6	 like working in fast food, like doing local delivery, like doing factory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=688.4s	688.4	 assembly, like moving things across the country in trucks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=692.3s	692.3	 So self-driving trucks, you know, factory automation, bio manufacturing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=697.6s	697.6	 additive and 3D manufacturing and 3D printing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=700.6s	700.6	 These are all industries that could benefit from the fact that labor now for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=705.0s	705.0	 kind of, you know, traditionally low income work has gotten so expensive that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=709.3s	709.3	 it starts to make sense to switch to the technology alternative, which historically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=712.6s	712.6	 may have been too expensive, but now starts to make economic sense to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=715.3s	715.3	 businesses. So there's a number of these automation industries that may
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=718.7s	718.7	 significantly benefit and that ends up ultimately being deflationary and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=722.1s	722.1	 market comes into balance. So that's another way to kind of think about the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=724.4s	724.4	 macro on what may play out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=726.0s	726.0	 There's a bigger risk here than just inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=728.3s	728.3	 I mean, there's also a risk of stagnation or stagflation because it's not just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=733.3s	733.3	 that prices are going up and workers wages are going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=735.9s	735.9	 It could be a good thing, but goods and services aren't being produced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=739.6s	739.6	 So, I mean, I know like my own experience, I recently ordered a Tesla.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=744.1s	744.1	 When I got a Tesla a couple of years ago, like I got it in two weeks, it was like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=748.8s	748.8	 almost instant this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=750.9s	750.9	 They wanted me to wait two months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=752.0s	752.0	 I had gotten an alert that it's going to take two more months beyond that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=755.0s	755.0	 So we have no idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=756.0s	756.0	 And if, you know, Tesla doesn't get most of the money, I don't think until I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=760.5s	760.5	 actually take delivery of the car, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=762.2s	762.2	 That's when you make final payment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=763.7s	763.7	 So now they can't book that revenue and those earnings and Tesla isn't even in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=768.0s	768.0	 the car company that's most affected by this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=769.5s	769.5	 You know, the big, you know, traditional American auto companies like Ford
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=773.3s	773.3	 are even more affected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=774.3s	774.3	 So if companies cannot deliver their products, that can cause an economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=780.7s	780.7	 recession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=781.2s	781.2	 And I think like these are major storm clouds looming on the horizon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=784.5s	784.5	 Now, what is the cause of this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=786.0s	786.0	 I mean, I think it's multifactorial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=789.0s	789.0	 A lot of things that Chamath said, I just want to really highlight this port issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=792.9s	792.9	 There was a great tweet storm by Zach Cantor earlier in the week where he said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=798.1s	798.1	 the supply chain crisis is a clever rebrand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=800.0s	800.0	 It makes it seem like there are grand exogenous forces at work rather than the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=803.5s	803.5	 unions holding ports for ransom while dozens of ships pile up, working just two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=808.9s	808.9	 shifts with a two hour break in between the country at their mercy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=813.2s	813.2	 And he goes on to elaborate on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=815.2s	815.2	 And that is why they're allowed to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=818.8s	818.8	 But but to most point, this is why Biden felt the need to get involved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=823.6s	823.6	 So that the problem is, if you read the fine print on this story of Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=829.1s	829.1	 announcing that the ports of L.A.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=831.6s	831.6	 and Long Beach will open 24 hours, which they clearly need to to get the goods to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=835.0s	835.0	 market, if you read the bottom part of the story, everyone's announcing their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=839.4s	839.4	 intention to go 24 seven, but there is no date certain for when that's going to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=845.1s	845.1	 It's a negotiation with the union.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=847.1s	847.1	 So Chamath, to your point, they are going to have to negotiate with the unions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=851.3s	851.3	 You know, initially, it looked like the story was that Biden was going to use his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=854.5s	854.5	 sway, his his clout with the unions to basically push them to take a deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=858.2s	858.2	 But I don't think he's really done that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=860.2s	860.2	 Everyone's just announcing their intentions to negotiate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=862.6s	862.6	 Well, you know, if the ports are holding the whole country hostage like this, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=866.8s	866.8	 could cause a recession. I think that's going to be very valid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=871.4s	871.4	 I think they're running 24 seven now, aren't they, Sacks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=874.2s	874.2	 Long Beach and L.A. are both running 24 seven.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=876.2s	876.2	 Well, I just posted this article that came out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=878.6s	878.6	 I mean, like yesterday, and it says it was published two days ago and it said there was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=884.8s	884.8	 not a date certain for when this is updated October 14th, which is yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=889.0s	889.0	 And if you read the bottom of the article, it says they have not determined a date for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=893.5s	893.5	 when 24 seven operations will start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=895.4s	895.4	 They've just merely announced their intention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=897.2s	897.2	 Oh, yeah, I'm just going to go 24 seven.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=898.8s	898.8	 The Biden administration says it's not really they announced it as if it was a done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=903.6s	903.6	 done. Look, unless Biden is willing to listen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=906.4s	906.4	 I mean, Chamath, you're right that they're entitled to negotiate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=908.6s	908.6	 But here's the thing. I mean, they're holding the whole country hostage now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=911.4s	911.4	 They're holding the economy hostage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=913.6s	913.6	 So at a certain point, if their demands are unreasonable, it's I think proper for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=918.2s	918.2	 president United States to step in and say, guys, this is ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=921.3s	921.3	 You have to go back to work. We're going to make you know, we're going to help negotiate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=924.8s	924.8	 a deal here. That's what Reagan did with the air traffic controllers, the air traffic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=928.1s	928.1	 controllers union shut down the whole commercial aviation system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=932.5s	932.5	 Reagan got involved, said you cannot shut down the economy this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=936.3s	936.3	 You must go back to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=937.8s	937.8	 Yes, exactly. So I think Biden is probably not that these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=941.0s	941.0	 upper-class foremen are or the ports, I guess they're not striking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=944.6s	944.6	 They're just not doing an extra shift.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=946.3s	946.3	 But he could do it. They're doing two shifts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=948.5s	948.5	 If they're doing two shifts, two hours a day, that's like withholding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=952.0s	952.0	 That's that's like a partial strike.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=953.9s	953.9	 Wait, they're doing two two hour shifts or two hours, eight hour shifts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=958.0s	958.0	 They can't be doing two hour shifts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=959.3s	959.3	 That makes sense. Why would anybody go to work for two hours?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=961.3s	961.3	 Read what Zak Hanner posted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=962.8s	962.8	 He said that they're working just two shifts with a two hour break in between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=966.4s	966.4	 OK, but those might be two eight hour shifts with a two hour break in between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=969.2s	969.2	 Is how I read that. No, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=970.6s	970.6	 It says read the tweet here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=973.1s	973.1	 He says before any changes this coming week, the longshore routine at the ports
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=977.6s	977.6	 involve two shifts, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 3 a.m.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=982.1s	982.1	 An overnight shift of five hours is available, but is up to 50 percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=985.6s	985.6	 more expensive and rarely used. So basically you're talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=989.5s	989.5	 Yeah, it's an eight to four p.m. shift with a two hour break or six p.m. to three.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=993.6s	993.6	 So basically, yes, so it is for that six hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=996.7s	996.7	 That's two six hour shifts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=998.4s	998.4	 They should be running it like, you know, you on runs the Tesla
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1001.6s	1001.6	 factors when they're building, which is 24 hours a day overlapping shifts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1004.8s	1004.8	 Just get it done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1005.5s	1005.5	 There has to be a sense of urgency here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1007.1s	1007.1	 They're going to have to pay some reasonable overtime, but they can't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1010.1s	1010.1	 The unions can't hold the whole country hostage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1011.9s	1011.9	 And look, if Biden, unless Biden steps in to solve this, we will have a recession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1015.8s	1015.8	 So it will.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1016.8s	1016.8	 Oh, so we do think that this could be a recession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1019.2s	1019.2	 I think it's bigger than just the ports.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1021.1s	1021.1	 I don't think reopening the ports is the entirety of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1023.8s	1023.8	 I think there's a lot of other things going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1025.3s	1025.3	 I mean, Jake, to a point you've made, we had four million people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1028.5s	1028.5	 drop out of the labor force last month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1030.5s	1030.5	 I mean, that was unbelievable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1032.1s	1032.1	 So, yeah, the unemployment rate looks great, but the number of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1036.0s	1036.0	 actually going to work is significantly lower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1037.8s	1037.8	 I mean, that was a huge shock to all the economists seeing that many people drop out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1041.6s	1041.6	 There's still too many people who essentially are being paid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1044.8s	1044.8	 not to work in one form or another, and that is hurting the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1048.4s	1048.4	 You also have this issue in China, which is very interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1052.0s	1052.0	 This was, I think, covered in The New York Times about how dependent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1056.8s	1056.8	 Chinese factories are on coal and which is a bad thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1061.3s	1061.3	 Obviously, that's not a clean energy source.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1063.0s	1063.0	 But because of restrictions on coal, it's actually started
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1066.8s	1066.8	 to impact manufacturing over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1068.6s	1068.6	 We can debate whether that's a good thing or bad thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1071.0s	1071.0	 But it's contributing to the effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1073.4s	1073.4	 I suspect that China has woken up to this and they will.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1077.2s	1077.2	 They're not going to shut down their economy because of concerns about clean energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1080.0s	1080.0	 So I assume this is a very temporary decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1083.3s	1083.3	 And then, of course, you have the whole issue of covid restrictions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1085.6s	1085.6	 I mean, there were a lot of international covid restrictions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1088.9s	1088.9	 It wasn't just in the US that where they were shutting down factories
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1092.2s	1092.2	 or creating a lot of rules that got in the way of keeping factories open.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1097.0s	1097.0	 They were doing this internationally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1098.2s	1098.2	 And there was a lot of regulations around seafaring as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1101.0s	1101.0	 because of covid restrictions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1102.5s	1102.5	 So you have this pile up, I would say, of of regulations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1106.8s	1106.8	 ultimately, I'd say with covid as the origin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1110.6s	1110.6	 that have now caused this supply chain crisis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1114.3s	1114.3	 And unless it gets fixed, it could absolutely cause a 1970 style
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1118.2s	1118.2	 stagflation type recession next year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1120.3s	1120.3	 Trimatha, you buy that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1121.2s	1121.2	 Do you think we could have this combination of people refusing to go to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1126.0s	1126.0	 or just opting out and saying, like, yeah, even if you pay me 35 or 40,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1129.6s	1129.6	 I'm just not interested. I have enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1131.1s	1131.1	 No, I don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1131.5s	1131.5	 F.T. is and I don't want to go back to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1133.5s	1133.5	 I actually think that's exactly what it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1135.5s	1135.5	 There was this really interesting tweet that I saw on Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1138.7s	1138.7	 Hopefully, Nick, you can find it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1139.9s	1139.9	 But it was some kid that basically said, you know, I'm growing up in Atlanta
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1144.6s	1144.6	 and there's a bunch of kids that I used to run with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1148.0s	1148.0	 you know, who would otherwise be in the streets, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1151.0s	1151.0	 Causing all kinds of trouble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1153.0s	1153.0	 And these kids are now at home, like speccing NFTs and like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1156.7s	1156.7	 you know, posting on TikTok or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1158.9s	1158.9	 It's just a completely different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1161.3s	1161.3	 reimagination of like labor and time spent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1164.3s	1164.3	 And and that's just a very small example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1167.0s	1167.0	 And so that maybe touches retail or maybe touches,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1169.8s	1169.8	 you know, quick service restaurants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1171.8s	1171.8	 But there's all these different things where now that at the end of this pandemic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1175.0s	1175.0	 people are making very different decisions about their time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1178.4s	1178.4	 and how to spend their money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1179.3s	1179.3	 And again, I'll tell you again, there is a lot of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1182.2s	1182.2	 You got to remember how many people in the United States have died
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1185.1s	1185.1	 or are dealing now with some reasonably important health issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1189.6s	1189.6	 at the back end of coronavirus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1192.0s	1192.0	 Half a million people, a million people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1194.9s	1194.9	 I want you to keep in mind what I told you guys before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1197.0s	1197.0	 There is 70 trillion dollars that has to get transferred down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1201.5s	1201.5	 from all these baby boomers down to these people in their 20s, 30s and 40s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1205.3s	1205.3	 And don't think for a second that they're not making different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1207.7s	1207.7	 optimization decisions around perceived wealth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1211.8s	1211.8	 So I just think inflation is here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1213.9s	1213.9	 I think the labor shortage is going to get worse, not better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1219.0s	1219.0	 I think we're going to have to pay people more to get out of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1222.0s	1222.0	 I think prices are going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1223.7s	1223.7	 Input costs are going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1225.5s	1225.5	 Energy costs are going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1228.8s	1228.8	 So this is it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1230.9s	1230.9	 And I mean, I think I think that probably the Fed and the ECB are really raising.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1236.2s	1236.2	 This time next year, they're probably in a really, really tighter posture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1240.6s	1240.6	 What do you think, Freeberg?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1242.4s	1242.4	 We should also remember that there are going to be some responses from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1246.9s	1246.9	 Sorry, Freeberg, blessing tech stocks in the fucking toilet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1251.5s	1251.5	 Why? Because no point in multiple because of the point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1254.1s	1254.1	 No, but no, no point for no cash flow growth stocks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1257.2s	1257.2	 Yeah. In rising, everyone's going to start buying yield when nobody wants it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1261.8s	1261.8	 Yucky poops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1262.9s	1262.9	 Let's explain this to the audience. Why, Freeberg?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1265.3s	1265.3	 Why? Why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1266.6s	1266.6	 I mean, once interest rates go up, you'll see that dividend yields will go up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1270.2s	1270.2	 which means stock prices go down because people will expect a higher return.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1273.6s	1273.6	 Because if I can buy treasury bonds and make a few points of return on my money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1277.2s	1277.2	 and I'm going to have to buy a stock, I'm going to want to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1279.2s	1279.2	 I'm going to demand a few more points of dividend yield on that stock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1283.0s	1283.0	 You're going to. So so so the price technique, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1285.5s	1285.5	 the price for stocks will typically go down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1289.0s	1289.0	 to match the yield that you're going to get from these more growth free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1291.8s	1291.8	 investments to be more precise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1294.4s	1294.4	 A stock is either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1297.5s	1297.5	 Mature and yielding about cash today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1300.4s	1300.4	 or effectively a promissory note about cash in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1304.0s	1304.0	 Thing with tech stocks is we tell everybody the same thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1306.6s	1306.6	 Your money is going to come 30 years from now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1308.7s	1308.7	 because we're going to be a monopoly by then.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1310.8s	1310.8	 And every dollar that I have today, I'm going to reinvest into R&D and engineering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1315.3s	1315.3	 And in a in an environment where interest rates are zero,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1318.2s	1318.2	 you're happy to do it because you're like, well, great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1320.2s	1320.2	 These guys are investing at way better rates than zero, which is what I get from,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1324.2s	1324.2	 you know, my bank.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1325.5s	1325.5	 And so I want Facebook and Google and Amazon and all these startups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1329.0s	1329.0	 to be putting all this money in the ground on my behalf.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1332.0s	1332.0	 But when interest rates start going up, they say, no, hold on a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1334.9s	1334.9	 I need more money up front, less money in the future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1338.1s	1338.1	 because the future becomes more uncertain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1340.4s	1340.4	 And that's the big tradeoff for tech companies where they get really pummeled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1344.2s	1344.2	 OK, well, is there a number in terms of interest?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1347.0s	1347.0	 There's a class of tech companies, right, like Amazon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1349.9s	1349.9	 Sorry, like Microsoft, Oracle, Google, where you are actually seeing an Apple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1355.2s	1355.2	 You're getting dividends and you're getting share buybacks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1357.9s	1357.9	 where the cash is coming out of the business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1359.8s	1359.8	 And those are the mature businesses that also still happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1362.4s	1362.4	 to have growth attached to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1363.9s	1363.9	 And I don't see how portfolios are going to shed those assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1368.2s	1368.2	 You're going to shed the more speculative, hey, you know, we're not yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1371.5s	1371.5	 at a point of maturity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1372.6s	1372.6	 We're still 20, 30 years out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1374.6s	1374.6	 Whatever. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1375.4s	1375.4	 The guys that are investing and there's no kind of line of sight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1377.6s	1377.6	 to true cash flow coming back to the shareholders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1379.9s	1379.9	 But look, at the end of the day, the point I was trying to make earlier was that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1384.6s	1384.6	 there is going to be a response, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1386.1s	1386.1	 So we've seen remember when the pandemic kind of set in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1389.0s	1389.0	 and everyone started ordering from home, Amazon rushed out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1391.6s	1391.6	 and hired 100,000 local delivery drivers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1394.2s	1394.2	 They bought all these trucks and they built their own supply chain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1396.9s	1396.9	 infrastructure for last mile delivery to get products to people's homes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1400.8s	1400.8	 And we're now seeing on the other side, Walmart, Home Depot, Target
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1405.2s	1405.2	 and other big retailers integrating their supply chain to get product into stores.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1409.8s	1409.8	 And so they're starting to buy trucks, hire people, pay them significant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1413.2s	1413.2	 wages to be drivers on staff for them rather than contracting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1416.8s	1416.8	 to these third parties that are saying, oh, we don't have any inventory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1419.4s	1419.4	 We don't have any trucks. We don't have any drivers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1421.0s	1421.0	 We can't do anything for you now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1422.5s	1422.5	 And so the response is, think about it, your product company, your Tesla.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1425.9s	1425.9	 Tesla just went out and did this massive deal in Caledonia to source,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1430.1s	1430.1	 you know, some mineral that they need to make batteries or to make their their cars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1433.9s	1433.9	 I can't remember exactly what it was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1435.1s	1435.1	 Nickel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1435.6s	1435.6	 But you're increasingly going to see the businesses that have a balance sheet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1439.5s	1439.5	 step up and actually start to integrate their supply chains rather than have this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1444.2s	1444.2	 More and more resilient kind of this disparate set of service providers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1447.9s	1447.9	 each of which is only kind of is all typically operating at max capacity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1451.6s	1451.6	 And then they can't kind of respond to these sorts of jolts to the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1454.8s	1454.8	 And so we're going to see a lot of investment, I think, by businesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1457.4s	1457.4	 that make product or deliver product to the consumer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1460.0s	1460.0	 as they try and integrate the supply chain problem themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1462.5s	1462.5	 And that may take some of the strain off the system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1464.5s	1464.5	 and some of this inflationary risk out of the equation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1466.6s	1466.6	 We'll see over the next couple of quarters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1468.2s	1468.2	 But certainly in this last earnings report, I saw some statistic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1471.2s	1471.2	 a very large percentage of earnings reports spoke directly about supply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1475.3s	1475.3	 chain disruption affecting the forecast for the business and the ability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1478.4s	1478.4	 for the for the business to meet their forecast goals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1480.8s	1480.8	 And that's just hurting everyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1482.3s	1482.3	 OK, so throw into that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1483.6s	1483.6	 I have to do something about it if the resource to do it right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1486.1s	1486.1	 All right. So, Sax, though, there are some silver linings here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1489.0s	1489.0	 Companies become more resilient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1491.0s	1491.0	 They become more automated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1492.5s	1492.5	 They build full stack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1494.4s	1494.4	 They build their own factories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1495.7s	1495.7	 We're seeing, you know, the Taiwanese semiconductor company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1499.7s	1499.7	 is doing a seven billion dollar project to build a new factory in Japan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1503.7s	1503.7	 funded by the Japanese government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1505.4s	1505.4	 So we're seeing a lot of redundancy redundancy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1508.2s	1508.2	 And we're also seeing the middle class grow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1511.1s	1511.1	 If people are making 35 bucks an hour, 40 bucks an hour,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1514.2s	1514.2	 and they're getting health care and they're starting to have overtime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1518.0s	1518.0	 and other concessions being made, that builds the middle class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1521.4s	1521.4	 It sounds like we're solving some problems as well as, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1525.6s	1525.6	 dealing with this, I guess, what you call it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1527.8s	1527.8	 Absolutely inflate looks and inflation is a good thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1530.8s	1530.8	 I know people think it's a it's like a really bad, terrible thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1534.0s	1534.0	 There are certain kinds of inflation that are really productive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1536.9s	1536.9	 We we have had to find a way to fight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1541.4s	1541.4	 the bad parts of technology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1542.7s	1542.7	 Technology is great. Nine, you know, nine out of 10 things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1545.5s	1545.5	 It's amazing efficiency, you know, all these great characteristics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1550.1s	1550.1	 that it gives you. But one crappy externality of technology is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1553.5s	1553.5	 it's deflationary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1555.0s	1555.0	 You can do more with less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1557.0s	1557.0	 And that's fundamentally not great for earnings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1559.3s	1559.3	 It's not great for labor participation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1561.0s	1561.0	 It's not great for all these things that people, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1563.3s	1563.3	 are really upset about today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1564.5s	1564.5	 So great for the individual company getting nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1567.3s	1567.3	 I actually think it's kind of like it actually balances out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1570.0s	1570.0	 the natural pace of technology, which is like you have the natural ability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1575.0s	1575.0	 to just actually have cheaper, faster, better this inherent efficiency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1578.3s	1578.3	 that's building up on one side of the ledger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1581.0s	1581.0	 But then what's great is on the other side of the ledger,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1583.1s	1583.1	 you actually have, you know, labor being able to balance it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1586.0s	1586.0	 And I think that that's a really good thing because they can demand more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1588.6s	1588.6	 to do the rest of the work that's not covered by tech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1591.5s	1591.5	 And I think that's important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1592.7s	1592.7	 What are your thoughts about this expanding middle class?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1595.0s	1595.0	 Isn't it a great thing that, you know, people are saying, I'll stay home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1598.6s	1598.6	 instead of making 12 bucks an hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1599.9s	1599.9	 It's an unfair wage. It's not a livable wage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1602.1s	1602.1	 And then all these companies are saying, you know what? OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1605.7s	1605.7	 They thought it so quick, the big companies, they went to 18 to $35
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1609.6s	1609.6	 an hour instantly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1610.8s	1610.8	 They always had the money to pay more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1612.5s	1612.5	 They just didn't need to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1614.1s	1614.1	 Increasing wages in real terms is a good thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1617.4s	1617.4	 I think you have to ask why the wages are going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1620.2s	1620.2	 Is it going up because of increased productivity, which is a good thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1623.2s	1623.2	 Or is it going up because of inflation is going up in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1627.1s	1627.1	 is going up because of inflation, then the wage gains are somewhat illusory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1630.3s	1630.3	 because all the products that consumers want to buy are also going up in price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1634.0s	1634.0	 All we've done is sort of is devalue the dollar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1637.2s	1637.2	 So we have to we don't know yet whether these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1640.2s	1640.2	 what we do know that inflation is actually very high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1642.2s	1642.2	 We don't know exactly if these wage gains are permanent or just a function of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1647.8s	1647.8	 But let's go back to this inflation point for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1650.0s	1650.0	 I think this is actually really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1651.9s	1651.9	 We're at something like a five point one percent inflation rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1654.8s	1654.8	 It's just about the highest since the late 70s, early 80s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1659.2s	1659.2	 Now we have this threat of a supply chain crisis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1661.8s	1661.8	 This is, you know, this is potentially we have a supply chain crisis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1665.6s	1665.6	 Yeah, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1666.3s	1666.3	 I mean, people can't sell cars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1668.1s	1668.1	 Right. This is a risk for stagflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1669.9s	1669.9	 Two point now. Now, the now I think there's an assumption
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1673.5s	1673.5	 that if inflation persists, the Fed will simply just fight it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1677.8s	1677.8	 They'll increase interest rates and what they'll control it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1680.4s	1680.4	 But I actually think that the degrees of of action
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1684.7s	1684.7	 that the Fed can take here might be more constrained than people think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1687.5s	1687.5	 I just want to flag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1688.7s	1688.7	 So one of the primary sources I use for the national debt is this website.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1692.8s	1692.8	 Fred dot St. Louis Fed dot org.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1695.8s	1695.8	 It's a good website that has a lot of charts by a branch of the of the Fed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1700.0s	1700.0	 So they have this chart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1700.8s	1700.8	 We've seen that federal debt as a percentage of GDP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1705.1s	1705.1	 is at sort of all time peacetime highs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1708.4s	1708.4	 You know, we're now we were at 100 percent for a few years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1711.3s	1711.3	 And now because of Covid, we just rocketed up over 120 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1715.1s	1715.1	 We're close to 140 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1716.3s	1716.3	 Now, the argument by mostly liberal economists that the debt didn't matter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1721.3s	1721.3	 was because the debt service remained very low on this debt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1724.7s	1724.7	 So we had a huge increase in debt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1726.0s	1726.0	 But because interest rates were so low,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1729.4s	1729.4	 the the the the debt service was still very, very small.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1732.2s	1732.2	 And I think, you know, they have a good piece on this website about this as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1736.3s	1736.3	 that I'll just post here in the notes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1738.0s	1738.0	 But I think I don't know if you guys remember back to a pod
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1742.3s	1742.3	 we did in May where we talked about Stanley Druckenmiller came out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1746.0s	1746.0	 swinging against the Fed and he warned about this very situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1750.4s	1750.4	 I just want to like I want to just read this this article that we covered back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1755.2s	1755.2	 I think in May, it feels like an eternity ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1757.3s	1757.3	 But remember when we just talked about this, what Druckenmiller warned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1761.1s	1761.1	 is that if yields on the 10 year Treasury rise, the projected level of four point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1765.0s	1765.0	 nine percent, which is simply the historical average,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1767.8s	1767.8	 the government spending would be close to 30 percent of GDP each year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1770.7s	1770.7	 simply paying back interest expense compared to two percent last year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1775.2s	1775.2	 Unless it monetizes the debt, which experts think is unlikely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1778.3s	1778.3	 And Druckenmiller believes would have horrible implications for us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1780.8s	1780.8	 So in other words, we now have this enormous debt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1783.8s	1783.8	 The only reason why debt service payments aren't crowding out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1786.6s	1786.6	 the entire federal budget is because we've had interest rates at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1790.5s	1790.5	 or really abnormal lows, zeros, basically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1793.2s	1793.2	 So how exactly is the Fed going to fight inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1796.1s	1796.1	 if they jack up interest rates to where they should be, say, four point nine percent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1801.0s	1801.0	 then the entire federal budget will be going against themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1804.3s	1804.3	 Right. It's like you're the bank and taking the loan at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1807.4s	1807.4	 This is like somebody who gets a variable interest mortgage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1810.8s	1810.8	 and they get five, ten years into their mortgage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1812.9s	1812.9	 And then all of a sudden they go from interest only and some low interest rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1816.5s	1816.5	 And then they have to pay market rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1818.4s	1818.4	 And they realize they can't afford the home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1819.7s	1819.7	 We might not be able to afford the budget we're putting out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1822.0s	1822.0	 There is what you're saying, Sax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1823.5s	1823.5	 Well, I'm saying the Fed may not have the tools.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1825.4s	1825.4	 All the tools they want to fight inflation if it comes back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1827.6s	1827.6	 Or, I mean, it's going to be politically very unpopular.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1829.8s	1829.8	 I mean, can you imagine the pressure the Fed will be under not to raise rates?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1833.5s	1833.5	 If it means that all of these discretionary programs basically have to be cut,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1837.2s	1837.2	 that we have an austerity mode in the federal budget.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1839.7s	1839.7	 How are we going to pay for all this debt service?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1842.3s	1842.3	 Yeah. And then the first thing to think about is, hey, maybe we should cut
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1846.0s	1846.0	 military spending since it's the largest at the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1849.5s	1849.5	 when China is doing sorties
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1853.3s	1853.3	 in and around Taiwan and the South China Sea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1855.8s	1855.8	 And we've got, you know, six, you know, navies doing coordinated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1860.4s	1860.4	 sailing there, which I think is a adjacent issue here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1863.7s	1863.7	 So historically, historically, great powers that want to remain great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1866.6s	1866.6	 don't owe over 100 percent of their economy, especially, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1870.3s	1870.3	 when a lot of it's held by foreign powers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1872.4s	1872.4	 I mean, that is a situation that makes us fragile, not anti-fragile.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1877.4s	1877.4	 Right. Because if we hit a crisis, if there is, you know, some unforeseen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1882.2s	1882.2	 military conflict, what what glass do we break now in case of emergency?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1886.4s	1886.4	 We've already spent we already at we're in peacetime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1889.3s	1889.3	 and we have wartime levels of debt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1891.8s	1891.8	 And now inflation is making a return and the Fed is going to make some really tough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1895.2s	1895.2	 choices about whether to control inflation and essentially impose austerity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1899.8s	1899.8	 on the on government spending or whether they monetize the debt,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1903.9s	1903.9	 which will lead to a runaway depreciation of the dollar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1907.2s	1907.2	 Neither one of those things is a good situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1909.0s	1909.0	 How would we have reduced austerity?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1911.6s	1911.6	 Well, they can't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1912.4s	1912.4	 But but again, if debt service rises to 30 percent of the federal budget,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1916.2s	1916.2	 where's that money going to come from?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1918.4s	1918.4	 You have to raise taxes and cut spending.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1920.6s	1920.6	 You have to do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1921.5s	1921.5	 And I think this is Joe Manchin's point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1923.2s	1923.2	 And, you know, if you've been listening to Joe Manchin talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1925.4s	1925.4	 the current reconciliation bill and he says, look, three point five trillion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1928.7s	1928.7	 Doesn't make sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1929.4s	1929.4	 We don't know what what situation we're going to confront in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1933.6s	1933.6	 We don't know what crises are coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1935.8s	1935.8	 We're going to reduce our ability to tackle all those future problems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1938.6s	1938.6	 by overspending right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1940.2s	1940.2	 That's been Joe Manchin's argument.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1941.5s	1941.5	 And looking at this risk of stagflation in the forms of the supply chain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1946.2s	1946.2	 shortage and this five point one percent interest rate number, you'd have to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1950.1s	1950.1	 that if we want to preserve any flexibility next year to raise interest rates,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1954.6s	1954.6	 you better be really careful about how much debt you incur now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1958.1s	1958.1	 Jamal, agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1960.6s	1960.6	 Yeah, look, when when when truck said that the 10 year break even was sort of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1965.2s	1965.2	 you know, at a five year high at the time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1968.3s	1968.3	 we're back there now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1971.7s	1971.7	 Look, I'm just going to I said this on CNBC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1974.3s	1974.3	 I'll just say it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1976.3s	1976.3	 I think it's coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1978.3s	1978.3	 I don't think it's a short term blip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1981.8s	1981.8	 And I think that we are in a period that will resemble the late 70s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1988.2s	1988.2	 And I think that, you know, you kind of want to be risk off and not own risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1993.0s	1993.0	 assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1994.8s	1994.8	 And by the way, it is hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=1996.4s	1996.4	 OK, because like we are all all of us, all four of us, both risk all we're both
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2001.4s	2001.4	 risk on and all we own our risk assets that are, you know, it's one thing to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2006.6s	2006.6	 let's take risk, but you could take risk and like lower of all things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2010.2s	2010.2	 This is this is like taking risk in the most risky thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2014.1s	2014.1	 That's what we all do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2015.7s	2015.7	 And at a time when people have run up the valuations of private market companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2019.5s	2019.5	 to a level that just nobody can understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2022.2s	2022.2	 I mean, look, I think you got to go to 18 months to kind of calculate the risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2026.1s	2026.1	 to kind of clean this stuff up, meaning like as market participants, we can, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2030.5s	2030.5	 know, we can shuck and jive and get everything into a decent place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2032.9s	2032.9	 But it's coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2034.7s	2034.7	 And I hope I'm wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2035.9s	2035.9	 But I think we'll look back on this and we'll say we said it probably eight to 12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2041.5s	2041.5	 months before it really reared its ugly head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2043.3s	2043.3	 But it's coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2045.4s	2045.4	 Freeburg, any thoughts on what's happening in Taiwan and what, you know, even a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2050.2s	2050.2	 modest conflict there would do to markets, given how to Sachs's point, this is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2055.9s	2055.9	 opposite of anti fragile.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2057.0s	2057.0	 We are in like full fragility here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2059.1s	2059.1	 I mean, this is like, you know, a tray full of champagne glasses on a boat in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2063.8s	2063.8	 rough seas. At any point, we could trip and everything comes crashing down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2067.0s	2067.0	 Does it feel like that to you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2068.5s	2068.5	 Freeburg, or do you feel like we're going to be able to navigate this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2073.4s	2073.4	 I mean, I don't know about Taiwan, but I think we're just going to keep inflating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2076.9s	2076.9	 our way out of this mess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2079.5s	2079.5	 Remember, like that's what we did last year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2082.5s	2082.5	 And it's what we'll do again this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2085.4s	2085.4	 The biggest losers in that equation are the middle class, because, you know, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2094.3s	2094.3	 middle class actually owns assets that are now going to be worth less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2099.2s	2099.2	 Folks who are not in the middle class that are below middle class don't own assets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2102.4s	2102.4	 so it doesn't really affect them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2103.6s	2103.6	 They just make higher wages, but stuff costs more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2106.5s	2106.5	 So they'll be fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2108.2s	2108.2	 And then, you know, wealthy individuals will end up getting taxed away to fund
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2113.7s	2113.7	 some of this. And I think that's the inevitable kind of way that the equation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2116.6s	2116.6	 balances.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2117.9s	2117.9	 Right. I mean, think about how much tax rates are about to go up right now in this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2121.4s	2121.4	 reconciliation bill. We haven't even gotten to like any of these crises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2125.3s	2125.3	 By the way, we don't know for sure if they're going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2127.0s	2127.0	 I think we could describe these things as storm clouds right now that are very much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2130.7s	2130.7	 on the horizon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2131.7s	2131.7	 Multiple storm clouds, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2133.2s	2133.2	 It's sort of like they're converging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2135.1s	2135.1	 Right. And if they do materialize in the way that we're talking about, what weapons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2138.9s	2138.9	 do we have left in order to fight them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2140.6s	2140.6	 What weapons of fiscal policy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2142.0s	2142.0	 What weapons of monetary policy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2143.6s	2143.6	 We're already going to have taxes on the all time high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2145.9s	2145.9	 Yeah, well, we're going to have taxes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2147.2s	2147.2	 Money. No, we're going to print money and we're going to pay ourselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2149.9s	2149.9	 We're going to go to the central bank.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2151.6s	2151.6	 It's what you said. We're going to monetize our debt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2154.2s	2154.2	 And that is a go up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2155.3s	2155.3	 That is a disaster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2156.4s	2156.4	 Remember, the top marginal tax rate was what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2159.9s	2159.9	 70 80 percent in the 60s and 70s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2163.2s	2163.2	 I mean, you know, that's likely where we're going to go back to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2165.9s	2165.9	 Well, I think we're already going to be back there as a result of the reconciliation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2169.6s	2169.6	 We're spending we've already done. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2172.0s	2172.0	 We've already broken the glass in case of emergency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2174.0s	2174.0	 We already got one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2175.3s	2175.3	 You're going to you're going to see some of these wealth taxes get chased down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2178.2s	2178.2	 You're going to see the top marginal tax rate go up 70 80 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2181.0s	2181.0	 You know, I mean, I think that's the way the equation balances.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2183.3s	2183.3	 It's not like the world's going to end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2184.3s	2184.3	 We're going to solve it by taking assets away from some.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2187.1s	2187.1	 And we're going to inflate all the assets like that sounds pretty bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2190.2s	2190.2	 Yeah. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2192.3s	2192.3	 I mean, 70, if you buy the way it's not going to affect me, it's not going to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2195.6s	2195.6	 So we're going to most of the situation for you, Burke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2198.4s	2198.4	 It will affect most people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2199.7s	2199.7	 It will affect most people, even though they don't think it will,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2202.3s	2202.3	 because it's going to affect the quality of our economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2204.2s	2204.2	 I'm just trying to predict what's going to happen, Sax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2206.0s	2206.0	 I'm not saying this is the solution to our problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2208.0s	2208.0	 I mean, I think the solution to our problem is technology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2210.2s	2210.2	 But, you know, the question is, does that come to market faster?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2213.0s	2213.0	 Say more about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2214.7s	2214.7	 I feel like we need a deflationary set of technologies that can, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2218.3s	2218.3	 mitigate all of these effects. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2219.9s	2219.9	 So we're automation, self-driving trucks, things that take the labor force,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2225.5s	2225.5	 because people don't want to work low income jobs factually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2229.3s	2229.3	 And, you know, now that there's a world, now that there's in America,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2232.5s	2232.5	 now that there's a world where people don't have where people have other options
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2235.5s	2235.5	 because other jobs have been created because we pump so much money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2238.1s	2238.1	 into these other industries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2239.8s	2239.8	 We're seeing people migrate away from low income jobs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2242.4s	2242.4	 like driving a truck for $10 an hour or working at McDonald's for $8 an hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2247.5s	2247.5	 And so to fill that gap and avoid the economic collapse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2250.3s	2250.3	 that will occur in those sectors of the economy, you need to automate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2253.5s	2253.5	 and you need to find solutions that can replace the labor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2256.8s	2256.8	 with some alternative technology solution that actually allows the product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2260.4s	2260.4	 to be fulfilled to the consumers that demand it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2263.2s	2263.2	 Or you're going to see rates go up, like you're going to be paying $12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2265.9s	2265.9	 for a hamburger because you're going to have to pay everyone $25.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2268.5s	2268.5	 Would an easy or a trauma or sex, either you can take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2271.2s	2271.2	 I'm sure you're both going to have opinions here, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2273.9s	2273.9	 we've been battling over immigration and nobody seems to understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2277.8s	2277.8	 how many people are coming into the country or under what system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2280.7s	2280.7	 Should we not tie the number of jobs available,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2284.3s	2284.3	 you know, over the trailing X number of months, years, quarters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2287.4s	2287.4	 to how many people are bringing to the country?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2289.1s	2289.1	 And couldn't we solve this by allowing five million people, a million people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2292.2s	2292.2	 whatever it is per year, a half million people in to take those low income jobs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2295.8s	2295.8	 and utilize that group of people to, you know, get businesses back on track?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2301.4s	2301.4	 I think it's too convenient to say that these are all low income jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2304.8s	2304.8	 I don't think that's necessarily true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2307.6s	2307.6	 And I think that it then starts to introduce a whole bunch of other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2310.5s	2310.5	 constraints to the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2311.6s	2311.6	 These are folks that then need health care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2313.7s	2313.7	 These are folks that need child care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2315.4s	2315.4	 These are folks that need, you know, that they are also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2319.0s	2319.0	 a tax on resources as well, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2321.0s	2321.0	 We are all tax on the natural resources and the infrastructure of our country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2325.4s	2325.4	 And so, you know, I don't think that that's the solution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2328.6s	2328.6	 necessarily to that specific problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2330.6s	2330.6	 What if the jobs that were coming in?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2334.3s	2334.3	 We have enough people here to do the work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2336.6s	2336.6	 But then we don't what we don't have is a market clearing price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2339.1s	2339.1	 for that work to get done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2340.9s	2340.9	 And so what I'm just trying to say is I think that the simpler
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2344.0s	2344.0	 and more obvious solution is to raise salaries until you get people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2348.7s	2348.7	 to fill these jobs. And I think that it's happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2350.8s	2350.8	 And so I do think that over the next year or two or three,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2354.0s	2354.0	 you're going to see, you know, labor rates basically go back up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2357.1s	2357.1	 and employment rates go back down and salaries go back up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2360.7s	2360.7	 and inflation go back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2362.5s	2362.5	 All of these things are going to happen together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2364.6s	2364.6	 That's the solution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2365.8s	2365.8	 I think immigration is a is a solution to a completely different problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2370.5s	2370.5	 Which is which is that we're not competitive, like I've, I really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2375.2s	2375.2	 see you're talking about bringing an elite, highly educated technical people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2378.5s	2378.5	 I really think that running a country should really be like running a sports team.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2383.8s	2383.8	 You know, and recruit the best talent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2386.1s	2386.1	 And you should really be recruiting the best talent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2388.2s	2388.2	 You should be looking at game film.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2390.0s	2390.0	 You should be coming up with plays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2391.4s	2391.4	 You should be running and testing those plays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2393.5s	2393.5	 You know, you should have different plays that you run in the first quarter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2396.3s	2396.3	 versus the fourth quarter, different plays when you're on the goal line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2399.1s	2399.1	 Sure. You know, and and I think that like when you look at professional sports,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2403.0s	2403.0	 one thing is that they don't see color, gender, sexual orientation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2407.1s	2407.1	 They see ability to be performant statistics,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2409.9s	2409.9	 add a task and statistical excellence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2412.5s	2412.5	 Yeah. And then they go seek statistical excellence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2414.7s	2414.7	 And and and if you translate that to a country,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2417.8s	2417.8	 my simple rubric on immigration is every year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2421.9s	2421.9	 there's a draft and America is the free place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2426.2s	2426.2	 Every free agent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2427.2s	2427.2	 We're the Yankees. Yeah, we're the Warriors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2429.3s	2429.3	 I fucked the Yankees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2431.0s	2431.0	 We're like the Warriors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2432.8s	2432.8	 Yankees are trash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2434.1s	2434.1	 Jesus Christ.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2434.8s	2434.8	 I'm just going to historically has won the most.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2437.3s	2437.3	 We're the New England Patriots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2438.8s	2438.8	 OK, cheater. We're the Chicago Bulls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2440.6s	2440.6	 We're the you know, we are the team that everybody would want to play for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2445.0s	2445.0	 It's up to us to have a good GM and a good president of the team
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2448.6s	2448.6	 and a good front office that just picks off all these smart geniuses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2452.1s	2452.1	 This should be I think your great point here, Chumak, as you're saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2454.7s	2454.7	 let's take the emotion out of this immigration and let's make it a point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2458.0s	2458.0	 based system, which, by the way, the point based system is what Australia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2461.8s	2461.8	 New Zealand, the UK, Canada all do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2463.8s	2463.8	 And Americans don't even know what the point based system is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2466.3s	2466.3	 Sax, what are your views as somebody who I've heard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2471.4s	2471.4	 leans a little bit to the right on opening up immigration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2475.2s	2475.2	 or maybe sweeping all this amazing talent globally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2478.5s	2478.5	 who have the highest statistics go?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2480.5s	2480.5	 I like Chumas sports team analogy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2482.8s	2482.8	 We want to get the biggest stars from all over the world to come to the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2488.0s	2488.0	 I mean, I think that makes sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2489.6s	2489.6	 I think, you know, this so-called immigration issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2491.7s	2491.7	 gets so confused with so many different things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2493.5s	2493.5	 I mean, first of all, there's immigration and then there's border security.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2496.9s	2496.9	 Right. And immigration are just having a border period.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2499.8s	2499.8	 And so many people think that if you're pro immigration,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2503.4s	2503.4	 you basically can't have a border.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2505.0s	2505.0	 I mean, that makes no sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2507.1s	2507.1	 You know, we need to have a border and we need to have actual
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2510.8s	2510.8	 like have an actual immigration policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2512.6s	2512.6	 Shouldn't just get be like, OK, you make it across.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2516.3s	2516.3	 I like you were saying, or if your guy, Ron DeSantis becomes president,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2520.4s	2520.4	 which it is, what will you tell Ron?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2522.4s	2522.4	 I like what you're saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2523.8s	2523.8	 I like what you're saying with the point system, having it be skills based.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2526.6s	2526.6	 I mean, that makes sense. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2527.7s	2527.7	 When the Republicans do that, they've been so emotionally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2530.6s	2530.6	 tied to this issue because of Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2532.8s	2532.8	 Can they actually, you know, tie themselves to something performance based
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2538.1s	2538.1	 and be not emotional about it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2539.6s	2539.6	 Can they change their position?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2541.4s	2541.4	 I think Trump actually did endorse like a more skills based immigration system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2546.3s	2546.3	 I think that I don't know that Republicans are the ones being emotional about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2549.3s	2549.3	 I mean, the people who are here are clearly, yeah, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2552.3s	2552.3	 the side that I think is like insane are the people who don't think we need a border.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2556.0s	2556.0	 I mean, you clearly have to have a border. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2558.3s	2558.3	 And even Obama came out recently and made a statement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2560.5s	2560.5	 that you have to have a border because the the the progressive left had gone so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2566.1s	2566.1	 It's almost like they wanted to be whatever Trump was doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2569.8s	2569.8	 They wanted to do the opposite of, you know, it's like pull the 180.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2573.1s	2573.1	 And so it's almost like the Biden administration policy became to stop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2577.2s	2577.2	 doing whatever it was that Trump was doing, including finishing the wall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2580.7s	2580.7	 I don't I don't really understand why that was like such a problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2584.3s	2584.3	 Yeah. Building a wall also seemed like ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2586.8s	2586.8	 We could just it's just one piece.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2588.2s	2588.2	 It's just one piece of the solution, but to stop it amid construction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2591.2s	2591.2	 Let me ask you a question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2592.5s	2592.5	 Yeah, it broke this week that you're hosting a fundraiser for Ron DeSantis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2597.4s	2597.4	 You got a little bit of blowback from that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2599.7s	2599.7	 From the woke, you know, in the San Francisco crowd.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2602.8s	2602.8	 But in terms of your influence with somebody like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2605.2s	2605.2	 do you think you can actually influence them to get Ron DeSantis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2608.5s	2608.5	 to listen to this episode and maybe talk about the point based system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2611.1s	2611.1	 and change the framing of that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2612.3s	2612.3	 Do you think you have enough influence to do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2615.0s	2615.0	 I don't know. I mean, I don't know exactly what his position on immigration is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2617.8s	2617.8	 That's not that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2618.8s	2618.8	 That's not like the set of issues that's that I respect him for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2622.1s	2622.1	 I mean, the reason why I wanted to support DeSantis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2625.4s	2625.4	 is that he was the first governor to end these insane lockdowns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2629.4s	2629.4	 And I mean, this is back in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2631.8s	2631.8	 It should have been obvious to everybody by May of 2020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2634.8s	2634.8	 that the lockdowns didn't work and he was the first one to roll them back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2639.2s	2639.2	 And and Florida did very well, especially considering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2642.4s	2642.4	 that they have so many old people in Florida.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2644.3s	2644.3	 So, you know, on the whole, not what I have done,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2646.6s	2646.6	 everything exactly the way he did it now, you know, nobody did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2649.6s	2649.6	 Perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2650.0s	2650.0	 No, but is he is he a Trump supporter and a Trump acolyte
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2654.2s	2654.2	 or is he distancing himself from?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2657.1s	2657.1	 I think, honestly, I think that point of view is coming from the point of view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2661.6s	2661.6	 of somebody who's not in the Republican Party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2663.7s	2663.7	 It doesn't have to deal with the dynamics of winning support in the Republican Party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2667.7s	2667.7	 That's what I'm saying. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2668.5s	2668.5	 So you have to basically toe the line with Trump to get the nomination.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2672.3s	2672.3	 I don't I don't see it as towing the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2674.1s	2674.1	 I just think, look, I think he's his own person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2676.2s	2676.2	 He's the governor of Florida.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2677.4s	2677.4	 He's setting policy over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2679.7s	2679.7	 He can be supported or not based on what he's doing in Florida.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2683.3s	2683.3	 I think like Trump is the issue that everybody on the other side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2687.4s	2687.4	 will want to talk about, but I don't think it's relevant to what he's doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2691.4s	2691.4	 It's not relevant to what he's doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2693.2s	2693.2	 Is there a civil war inside of the Republican Party over this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2695.1s	2695.1	 And should we support Trump?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2696.9s	2696.9	 I wouldn't say I wouldn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2698.5s	2698.5	 I wouldn't say it's a civil war, but there definitely is some some conflict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2702.6s	2702.6	 And yeah, I mean, what's wrong?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2705.7s	2705.7	 I hope it resolves in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2707.5s	2707.5	 Oh, look, I think elections are always about the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2709.4s	2709.4	 I don't think people want to relitigate the past.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2712.0s	2712.0	 And I think that and I think that the Republican Party be wise,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2716.5s	2716.5	 I think, to find a candidate of the future and not try to rehash or relitigate the past.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2722.2s	2722.2	 Another good reason for me to support DeSantis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2724.2s	2724.2	 I think he is a future looking, future oriented candidate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2729.3s	2729.3	 I do think that, look, I'll say it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2731.1s	2731.1	 The stuff I hear Trump doing now in these speeches where he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2734.2s	2734.2	 relitigating what happened last year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2738.1s	2738.1	 and attacking other Republicans like McConnell,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2741.3s	2741.3	 because he doesn't because they failed his personal loyalty test.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2745.0s	2745.0	 It's a little bit like what he did, frankly, in Georgia with the runoffs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2749.0s	2749.0	 where he sowed so much chaos that the Republicans lost a seat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2754.5s	2754.5	 the Purdue seat that they had won on election night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2757.6s	2757.6	 And they had that runoff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2758.9s	2758.9	 And you have to say that a huge part of the reason for that was the was Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2763.0s	2763.0	 attacking Raffles, Berger and all the Georgia GOP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2766.8s	2766.8	 because he thought they were insufficiently loyal to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2769.0s	2769.0	 And then, you know, you got the whole the tape come out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2771.4s	2771.4	 can you just find 11000 votes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2773.4s	2773.4	 I mean, I think voters in Georgia punished the Republican Party for that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2778.4s	2778.4	 by by giving that seat to the Democrats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2780.8s	2780.8	 That is the that that margin created the Democratic majority,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2784.9s	2784.9	 which will now give us probably an incremental four to six trillion of spending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2789.4s	2789.4	 and tax increases that we wouldn't otherwise have had.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2791.8s	2791.8	 So I do think these elections are very important and it would behoove the Republicans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2796.0s	2796.0	 Look, I'm not I'm not like one of these never Trump or people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2799.0s	2799.0	 Who I'm just obsessed with Trump, period.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2801.1s	2801.1	 I just think the Republicans need to run a future looking candidate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2804.8s	2804.8	 not a backwards looking candidate in 2024.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2807.2s	2807.2	 And I think DeSantis could be that guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2809.0s	2809.0	 It's very, very early to say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2810.6s	2810.6	 I mean, the first thing he has to do is run for governor for reelection in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2815.4s	2815.4	 which I think is next year is 2022.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2817.6s	2817.6	 So I will support him for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2819.4s	2819.4	 All right, you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2820.1s	2820.1	 Anybody read the Ted Sarandos memo?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2823.1s	2823.1	 Yeah, this is great. They should definitely jump into this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2825.2s	2825.2	 We talked about the Chappelle performance,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2827.8s	2827.8	 a sax and free bird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2829.3s	2829.3	 You haven't seen it. Did you watch it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2830.6s	2830.6	 Did you watch it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2832.2s	2832.2	 Oh, God, what nerd you haven't watched yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2834.3s	2834.3	 Oh, my God. You guys are culturally bankrupt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2837.0s	2837.0	 What were you guys doing this week, like fucking beakers and like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2840.6s	2840.6	 Jesus, you were just like, you like in like some laboratory doing like sass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2845.6s	2845.6	 They were doing their.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2846.2s	2846.2	 I haven't watched it yet, but I don't need to watch it to know I support it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2850.8s	2850.8	 Freedom is just yeah, it doesn't have to click on the link.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2854.6s	2854.6	 All right. So just almost nothing Chappelle could say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2857.3s	2857.3	 to make me want to cancel him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2860.0s	2860.0	 I mean, and by the way, I've seen a lot of Chappelle and I love Chappelle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2863.2s	2863.2	 So I think I understand that just what he was doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2866.2s	2866.2	 But I do need to see it still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2867.9s	2867.9	 All right. He should not be canceled. It's ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2871.1s	2871.1	 I don't think he is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2873.1s	2873.1	 He's going to survive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2874.3s	2874.3	 Of course, he goes beyond this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2876.8s	2876.8	 Let me read you from it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2878.1s	2878.1	 So everybody knows that the name of the special he did was a closer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2882.0s	2882.0	 It was released on October 5th.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2883.9s	2883.9	 A lot of outcry from GLAAD and advocacy groups and actually people inside of Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2891.1s	2891.1	 There's been some resignations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2892.5s	2892.5	 There have been some people who contribute content to Netflix who are now saying they'll not work with the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2898.5s	2898.5	 And the really interesting Ted Sorrento sent a memo to the entire company on Monday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2903.8s	2903.8	 And he's this is the second one he sent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2906.1s	2906.1	 And he says, We know that a number of you have been left angry, disappointed and hurt by our decision to put Dave Chappelle's latest special on Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2914.0s	2914.0	 Very interesting opening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2915.5s	2915.5	 He's he's addressing their feelings just this is a masterclass in a memo, because in that first part, he just addresses I understand you feel that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2923.1s	2923.1	 With the closer, we understand that the concern is not about offensive to some content, but titles which could increase real world harm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2931.3s	2931.3	 So now he's framing their argument as it's not because it's offensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2935.2s	2935.2	 It's because of real world harm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2936.4s	2936.4	 You brought this up before, Sachs, the real world harm concept with Apple and Antonio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2942.5s	2942.5	 While some employees disagree, we have a strong belief that content on screen does not directly translate to real world harm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2948.4s	2948.4	 It's not exactly true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2949.8s	2949.8	 We'll get into that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2950.8s	2950.8	 The strongest evidence to support this is that violence on screens has grown hugely over the last 30 years, especially with first party shooter games.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2958.0s	2958.0	 And yet violent crime has fallen significantly in many countries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2962.1s	2962.1	 And so he goes above and beyond just talking about offensive material.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2966.2s	2966.2	 Adults can watch violence, assault and abuse, or enjoy shocking stand up comedy without it causing them to harm other stand up comedians often expose issues that are uncomfortable, because the art by nature is highly provocative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2981.7s	2981.7	 As a leadership team, we do not believe that the closer is intended to incite hatred or violence against anyone poor sensitive content guidelines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2988.9s	2988.9	 So basically, he says, you know, if you don't like it, change the channel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2993.4s	2993.4	 If you're a customer, you can cancel your subscription.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2995.3s	2995.3	 Or if you work here, and you don't like it, you don't need to work here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=2998.1s	2998.1	 But is this the end of cancel culture?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3000.1s	3000.1	 This combined with Brian Armstrong's positioning?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3002.5s	3002.5	 Sachs, this is your I don't I don't think it's the end of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3005.2s	3005.2	 For the simple reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3006.9s	3006.9	 Let's assume that this comic had not signed $60 million deal with with Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3011.7s	3011.7	 Let's say he had signed a $60,000 deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3014.2s	3014.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3015.4s	3015.4	 Or six million, whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3016.5s	3016.5	 And and and he didn't have the legions of fans that that Dave Chappelle had.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3021.2s	3021.2	 Do you think that Sarandos would make making the same decision?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3024.4s	3024.4	 I mean, I think that special by, you know, by a Netflix comedy by Dave Smith would be swept under the rug right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3032.4s	3032.4	 We that would never see the light of day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3034.6s	3034.6	 I think the same thing was true with Joe Rogan and Spotify.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3036.8s	3036.8	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3037.1s	3037.1	 I mean, Spotify made a $60 million deal with Rogan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3041.9s	3041.9	 The 100 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3043.5s	3043.5	 The employees all protested and Spotify stood tall for Rogan, but they had every economic incentive to do so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3050.3s	3050.3	 I don't completely trust these companies that if it wasn't massively in their bottom line interest, that they would have stood up for free speech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3057.0s	3057.0	 I suspect that if it was, you know, it would not have they would not have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3060.8s	3060.8	 I think we all know that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3061.7s	3061.7	 No, he said in the email sticks and stones is one of the most watched, you know, piece of content we have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3067.0s	3067.0	 And this the closer was like top four or five in America over like the last few weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3072.6s	3072.6	 So there is a huge economic incentive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3075.2s	3075.2	 And and Reed Hastings said the same thing when he posted the other co CEO into a group forum, which said, listen, our job is to please our customers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3085.0s	3085.0	 And all this data says is that we've pleased our customer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3089.4s	3089.4	 Right. And I think in the case of that, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3092.8s	3092.8	 And I think to me, that's him putting his foot down and saying we're going to make the content we want to make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3097.4s	3097.4	 I don't I don't think it's a principle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3099.3s	3099.3	 I don't think it's a super.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3100.3s	3100.3	 Look, I don't want to I don't want to look past it because I think that it's so rare to get a memo like Sarandos wrote where he's defending artistic freedom or freedom of speech or what have you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3112.3s	3112.3	 I mean, it's so rare to ever see that that I don't want to gainsay it too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3116.8s	3116.8	 But I also do believe that this sort of special treatment is really reserved for the for the artists, the creators, like a Chappelle, like a Rogan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3127.0s	3127.0	 They're basically too big to cancel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3128.5s	3128.5	 I mean, these companies have spent too much money on their programs to just summarily cancel them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3134.1s	3134.1	 They also, again, like I said, have legions of fans who would rise up and protest if they were canceled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3138.6s	3138.6	 But I don't think but I don't think these companies would make the same decision for the the middle, the mid-level creator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3144.6s	3144.6	 And in a sense, Rogan and Chappelle, they're post economic, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3148.1s	3148.1	 I mean, they've made so much money that they're free to do what they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3151.6s	3151.6	 And they've got a big enough audience to protect themselves from these companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3155.0s	3155.0	 But it's the little creator who's still on their way up who can never take the kinds of creative risks that Chappelle is taking or that Rogan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3161.7s	3161.7	 Well, they can take it. They just can't do it on Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3163.8s	3163.8	 But I the tone of this to me sound sounded like a manifesto and the end of the discussion from dad like we're doing this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3172.8s	3172.8	 If you don't like it, get off the ship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3174.3s	3174.3	 But this is the way the ship is going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3176.2s	3176.2	 That's the way I read it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3177.0s	3177.0	 And I think Spotify did a similar thing with Joe Rogan, to your point, which was, hey, listen, there are some content out there from like Alex,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3184.7s	3184.7	 Jones, or some people who are just conspiracy theorists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3187.6s	3187.6	 They took down those episodes and Joe Rogan was like, I don't care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3189.9s	3189.9	 I got paid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3191.4s	3191.4	 But yeah, it does feel to me like this is a tipping point when you put Brian Armstrong, Joe Rogan, and Chappelle together that corporations are going to say, you know what, the mob is fine, you can have your opinion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3201.9s	3201.9	 But your opinion stops where we have to run a business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3204.3s	3204.3	 Freeberg, what are your thoughts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3206.1s	3206.1	 I think Netflix has an appreciation for artistry, certainly evident by the money they've spent and the product they put out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3214.9s	3214.9	 And I think good artists and good artistry is, you know, can be provocative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3222.2s	3222.2	 It's designed to make you change your opinion, look at things differently, think about things differently, and be challenged in the norms of, you know, your everyday life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3231.9s	3231.9	 And I think that's important in art in all forms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3238.0s	3238.0	 And that means seeing and being exposed to and being engaged by things that you don't normally get exposed to and engaged by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3244.6s	3244.6	 And I think that's what Chappelle is fantastic at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3247.2s	3247.2	 And I think that's what other great art is great at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3249.3s	3249.3	 And I think that as long as Netflix maintains that ethos, that artistry does that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3254.0s	3254.0	 And the good thing is, people appreciate it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3256.3s	3256.3	 And they appreciate that form.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3258.8s	3258.8	 And they appreciate being challenged in that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3260.6s	3260.6	 And I think that as a result, the market will, as Reed Hastings identified, continue to demand it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3266.8s	3266.8	 And as much as some people might be offended, it's the fact that it is offensive that I think makes it good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3272.6s	3272.6	 So let me ask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3273.3s	3273.3	 And I think that they appreciate that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3274.5s	3274.5	
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3274.5s	3274.5	 Let me frame it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3275.5s	3275.5	 Chappelle, I hope you're right about what this means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3277.5s	3277.5	 I mean, let me be really clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3279.0s	3279.0	 I mean, I hope it goes down exactly the way that you're saying, because that is what I want to believe is happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3284.8s	3284.8	 I'm a little bit skeptical that this is a little bit more of a bottom line motive because they got so much money at stake that they can't afford to cancel Chappelle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3292.6s	3292.6	 But I hope you're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3293.6s	3293.6	 I hope you're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3294.6s	3294.6	 That is a statement of principle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3296.1s	3296.1	 And they will apply that principle to lesser known artists who can't protect themselves as much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3302.0s	3302.0	 And hopefully this is kind of like what it reminds me of is the John Stewart lab, the Wuhan Lab leak moment where you had John Stewart go on Colbert show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3314.8s	3314.8	 And he all of a sudden he made it OK to talk about the lab leak theory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3318.6s	3318.6	 It was like you couldn't talk about it before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3320.7s	3320.7	 He cracked the Overton window.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3321.8s	3321.8	 Yes, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3323.0s	3323.0	 And so hopefully Chappelle will do that for this like woke cancellation mob is to finally get everybody to realize, oh, like we can stand up to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3332.2s	3332.2	 Chamath is the Overton window on a go forward basis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3336.1s	3336.1	 Do you see it closing more staying where it is or perhaps even opening?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3341.0s	3341.0	 There's a there's a really great philosopher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3343.7s	3343.7	 This is this is my maybe my one and only grand tribute to Peter Thiel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3350.5s	3350.5	 But he he is he's a huge supporter of a philosopher named René Girard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3357.2s	3357.2	 And I agree with a lot of a lot of that, a lot of René Girard's philosophies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3364.5s	3364.5	 And basically, it's called mimetic theory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3366.9s	3366.9	 And the idea is you're born without preferences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3370.0s	3370.0	 And then you kind of just copy what's around you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3372.4s	3372.4	 And so what the other person wants is what you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3374.6s	3374.6	 And that's what ultimately leads to a lot of conflict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3377.6s	3377.6	 And the only way to resolve conflict is with a huge grand sacrifice of some kind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3382.6s	3382.6	 OK. And if you think about it here, if you're going to really put, you know, cancel culture, if you're going to kill it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3392.0s	3392.0	 There needs to be some just massive escalation and conflict around this idea that allows us to resolve it in one way or the other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3401.5s	3401.5	 In one direction or the other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3403.9s	3403.9	 And I don't think this is it. I think it's not big enough, quite honestly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3406.9s	3406.9	 I think it's a little bit sort of like, you know, there's folks like us that love comedy and we're willing to keep it in a very strict box, which is let people say what they're going to say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3416.4s	3416.4	 Be shocked with it and don't take it onto yourself and don't, you know, and go and reflect it into the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3422.0s	3422.0	 It's entertainment and you can you know, it's like I choose not to watch violent stuff because I don't like it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3428.7s	3428.7	 I find it I find it very offensive or, you know, I don't play first person shooters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3432.7s	3432.7	 I find it really unsettling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3434.6s	3434.6	 You know, Grand Theft Auto, I found it really outrageous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3438.7s	3438.7	 And other people will feel like that about Chappelle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3442.7s	3442.7	 My whole thing is we should all be allowed to make those judgments because I think we're all still pretty rational people at the end of the day and do the right thing in the normal world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3450.2s	3450.2	 But this isn't the thing that's going to get this issue to be resolved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3453.4s	3453.4	 So I don't know how it comes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3455.1s	3455.1	 There needs to be some huge escalation around this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3458.4s	3458.4	 I suspect what happens is it actually just dissipates and goes away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3464.4s	3464.4	 And the reason is because everybody who's much younger than us has such a huge digital footprint that they've created for their whole lives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3473.1s	3473.1	 There is so much shit that's out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3475.5s	3475.5	 God, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3476.3s	3476.3	 That they just have no choice but to let everybody else off the hook.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3480.6s	3480.6	 We we are in a very different situation because we were doing some fucking shady stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3486.8s	3486.8	 Always on the down low.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3488.2s	3488.2	 Well, he's hidden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3489.4s	3489.4	 Whoa, easy there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3490.9s	3490.9	 But that's how it was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3492.0s	3492.0	 We were in our our child.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3493.2s	3493.2	 We're largely anonymous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3494.3s	3494.3	 You would you would roll deep and you would just you would pretend you would not you know, and now the culture is very different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3500.2s	3500.2	 And I think with that comes a lot of acceptance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3502.6s	3502.6	 Every you know, every kid at some point may or may not be on Tinder, Bumble, Ria, you know, Grindr, whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3510.3s	3510.3	 So there's going to be a body of that content that's up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3513.3s	3513.3	 Every kid will have said something crazy, you know, on TikTok.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3517.4s	3517.4	 And all of this stuff will be there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3518.7s	3518.7	 And so you'll have a choice, which is if you're going to hold me accountable, I'm going to hold you accountable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3522.2s	3522.2	 And so it's mutually assured destruction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3524.2s	3524.2	 And I think that's what causes cancel culture to go away in time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3527.8s	3527.8	 It's the last vestige of very guilty people of our generation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3532.8s	3532.8	 Fascinating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3533.8s	3533.8	 What do you think, Fieberg?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3534.7s	3534.7	 Is the overton window opening, closing or about the same?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3537.3s	3537.3	 I think I think what Timotha is saying is right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3539.8s	3539.8	 I I think I've referred to this book called The Light of Other Days before when we talked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3544.8s	3544.8	 I think so, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3545.8s	3545.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3546.8s	3546.8	 The book is like all about this notion of all information is available to everyone everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3551.6s	3551.6	 And societal norms completely change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3553.8s	3553.8	 People no longer find things offensive and they no longer and everyone basically shifts to a mode of much more kind of open dialogue because, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3561.4s	3561.4	 keeping things behind closed doors and then positioning one person against the other completely changes when you can see everyone's cards all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3569.6s	3569.6	 And so I think, yeah, generally we're headed that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3571.6s	3571.6	 I don't think we're going to information wants to be free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3574.4s	3574.4	 More information is being generated about each of us all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3577.3s	3577.3	 I don't think that we're headed in the opposite direction, kind of back to a Victorian era.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3580.6s	3580.6	 I think we're going in the other way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3581.9s	3581.9	 So there's going to be blips and starts that'll kind of, you know, be setbacks on that general trajectory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3589.0s	3589.0	 So, yeah, I do think it's a moment, you know, it's a moment in time right now where this is happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3595.5s	3595.5	 I mean, Saxon, look at the two examples we've discussed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3598.7s	3598.7	 Brian Armstrong and Coinbase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3601.8s	3601.8	 That was about essentially Black Lives Matters and talking about social justice at work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3606.5s	3606.5	 And this one is about trans and trans rights.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3610.3s	3610.3	 And essentially, I don't want to say poking fun at or, you know, discussing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3617.0s	3617.0	 I mean, he basically says in it that he's Team Turf.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3621.6s	3621.6	 If you were to take two organizations that standing up against would be the most challenging and difficult.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3626.4s	3626.4	 I think those are the top two. No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3629.4s	3629.4	 I guess so. I mean, that's why I think this is the most telling is that you have two different organizations saying, hey, we're going to put our foot down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3635.6s	3635.6	 Just for background, Netflix had a very strange.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3639.0s	3639.0	 I didn't see the actual film, so I won't make judgment on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3642.0s	3642.0	 But it was a very strange trailer for a film called Cuties, which was really over sexualizing young girls like eight, nine, ten year old girls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3650.4s	3650.4	 And they didn't take it down in the United States, Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3654.6s	3654.6	 But they did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3655.5s	3655.5	 It was in France. It was in France.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3657.7s	3657.7	 It was a French movie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3658.8s	3658.8	 Yes. And they have a different view of kids and sexuality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3662.6s	3662.6	 And, yeah, I think people found it a little dark here in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3667.0s	3667.0	 But they survived that one as well, or they weathered that one as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3670.6s	3670.6	 So I think what people are finding is if you put your foot down at a certain point, I think what's access says is right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3675.7s	3675.7	 Then these guys have realized that if we have this very specific message around artistic freedom and we never violate it, because that's one of those things where if you take that hill, you have to be there forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3688.6s	3688.6	 Right. You can't have asterisks around that idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3691.8s	3691.8	 But by doing that, they basically dominate the content production game in Hollywood, which then allows them to feel the most content at the cheapest average price, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3700.5s	3700.5	 then makes churn less and customer acquisition higher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3704.8s	3704.8	 And they're already the largest media company in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3707.0s	3707.0	 And they're only going to get bigger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3708.4s	3708.4	 You know, they're a Netflix has about 200 million subscribers, they're going to get to a billion subscribers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3713.3s	3713.3	 It's just inevitable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3714.3s	3714.3	 And so for them, I do think it's a very rational business position to take, which is that I have to appeal to a billion people over the next, you know, seven or eight years, you don't have to watch everything on Netflix, you do not have to listen to every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3728.0s	3728.0	 Netflix is a fucking mess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3729.3s	3729.3	 I mean, they should spend 10 minutes and improve the UI actually find something my god, it's so bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3736.4s	3736.4	 I you know, he he basically Sarandos made the point that, you know, along with Chappelle show, they're funding a ton of content by people of color, probably more than anybody and trans people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3745.8s	3745.8	 It's a big focus of what they're doing at Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3748.2s	3748.2	 And it's, you know, essentially, to saxes point more speech is better than less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3753.4s	3753.4	 All right, do we want to go tether FDA chaos?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3757.0s	3757.0	 Why don't you take? Why don't you do your reverse victory lap? Because after all your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3761.8s	3761.8	 lap for me, bro, it was the exact opposite. It is not a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3767.2s	3767.2	 fucking fraud. Come on, please guys saying that apparently the CFTC went in did the work and is actually now refuting what you thought was the case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3776.6s	3776.6	 Okay, why don't you just how about I read you the quote from at least June 1 2016 to February 25 2019.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3781.6s	3781.6	 When they're misrepresented to customers, and the market that tether maintain sufficient US dollar reserves to back every USDT in circulation with the equivalent equivalent amount of corresponding fiat currency held by tether and safely deposit in tether bank accounts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3796.9s	3796.9	 In other words, they told everybody they were one for one, they were not they lied to the public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3802.6s	3802.6	 They're getting a $41 million. That's why they're banned from New York. And that's why they're banned from trading in Canada. I think and they're supposedly a Department of Justice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3814.0s	3814.0	 These guys are shady as a shady.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3818.6s	3818.6	 Do you have an economic interest in tether?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3821.2s	3821.2	 No, in crypto. He does. No, no, no, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3823.2s	3823.2	 can't even have an economic interest in tether. All it is a one for one tokenized dollar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3827.1s	3827.1	 Well, no, it's not. That's what they claim it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3829.8s	3829.8	 I know you're right that it should be and we need an audit to establish that it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3834.5s	3834.5	 and they won't audit they'll do an attestation. And when they did their attestation, all they have to do is show a document that says there's money in an account. They don't have to show how long that's been in the account.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3843.0s	3843.0	 Certainly, this certainly feels like a security to me. And I would think the SEC should get involved in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3849.5s	3849.5	 stable coins are the number one thing on Gensler and the SEC is mind right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3854.0s	3854.0	 I mean, they make a claim of a secured interest in something unlike
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3857.1s	3857.1	 this is like crypto. This is the easiest part of the regulation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3861.3s	3861.3	 Why is it? Why? Because because you audit it, you're done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3865.0s	3865.0	 It's a tokenized dollar. That's it. It is not actually my insurance security.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3869.3s	3869.3	 It basically is a digital representation of a dollar that you're seeing in a bank account somewhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3872.9s	3872.9	 It's a money market. It's a money market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3874.5s	3874.5	 Funds are securities and they're regulated as security.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3877.1s	3877.1	 OK, fine. But my point is, you know, there are complicated securities and there's securities that aren't complicated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3882.1s	3882.1	 This is definitely the least complicated that this company only has to their own attestations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3889.1s	3889.1	 like six percent, three to six percent in cash in a bank account.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3892.5s	3892.5	 And the rest is in highly volatile corporate paper.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3897.3s	3897.3	 Here's the point that I was trying to make to you in the group chat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3899.9s	3899.9	 When a company who's got billions and billions and billions of dollars of some stable coin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3905.3s	3905.3	 or something that you think is zero, OK, it's a multi multi billion dollar market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3910.5s	3910.5	 Tens of billions. Oh, sorry. Tens of millions of dollars billion in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3915.1s	3915.1	 And could you imagine if they like let's just say there were 70 billion of tether and like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3919.7s	3919.7	 one billion of securities, that would be a fraud of gargantuan proportions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3925.1s	3925.1	 We would be talking if they siphon the money out for their own use.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3928.7s	3928.7	 That would be beyond talking about fines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3930.9s	3930.9	 What I found comical, Jason, is your claims make it seem like Bernie made off Enron level
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3936.5s	3936.5	 corruption craziness. Hold on. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3938.7s	3938.7	 And the fine was 42 million, which is like who fucking cares? 42 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3943.1s	3943.1	 And it was between them and another firm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3945.3s	3945.3	 So either the CFTC completely got the fine wrong and they missed a zero or two zeros.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3950.9s	3950.9	 Or this was not nearly as big as you thought it was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3953.5s	3953.5	 I'm shocked, shocked that Jaycock got overly excited about some perceived hopes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3960.5s	3960.5	 Here we go. Another conspiracy theorist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3963.1s	3963.1	 I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I was right about Theranos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3966.3s	3966.3	 Yeah, Jason didn't fully understand something and got very emotional about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3969.7s	3969.7	 Look, here's why. That's it. I'm off. That's it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3972.3s	3972.3	 I got here. So here's the best case scenario for making sense of J.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3976.0s	3976.0	 Cal's points, which is it's possible that tether the company behind tether has all the money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3981.5s	3981.5	 They've just not chosen to keep it in dollar reserves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3985.7s	3985.7	 And so they put it in corporate bonds and a whole mishmash of different things to get the float,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3990.7s	3990.7	 to get the money. So they're so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3994.7s	3994.7	 I don't. My guess is that tether is solvent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3997.9s	3997.9	 I don't think it's it lacks solvency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=3999.8s	3999.8	 But but I personally would feel better about any stable coin if it was a hundred percent dollar backed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4004.9s	4004.9	 I think it should be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4006.1s	4006.1	 Which is what Jeremy Lair is doing at USTC and Circle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4009.7s	4009.7	 I had him on the pod this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4011.2s	4011.2	 I hope they bought the GitLab IPO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4015.3s	4015.3	 Well, I mean, the issue here is they also commingled funds, which is what got Fulton in trouble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4021.5s	4021.5	 The user's accounts with their money in it was mixed with the operating capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4026.3s	4026.3	 So they were using the deposits to operate the business, which is the biggest no no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4031.7s	4031.7	 They were commingling the funds that people bought were backed and Bitfinex and tether were the same company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4040.1s	4040.1	 That's why they both got the fines at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4042.1s	4042.1	 They've also been banned from doing any having any customers in New York and they've been banned in Canada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4046.9s	4046.9	 And there's apparently a DOJ wire for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4048.9s	4048.9	 So I think this is the beginning of the end, not the end of the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4053.9s	4053.9	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4054.5s	4054.5	 I was just wanting to get your reaction to what seemed like a really pathetic fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4060.1s	4060.1	 I mean, 70 billion dollar fraud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4063.1s	4063.1	 I mean, Facebook got a series of speeding tickets to I mean, I think that that's I mean, that's a big issue for our government is that these companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4071.9s	4071.9	 What's that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4072.5s	4072.5	 It paid like five billion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4074.9s	4074.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4075.2s	4075.2	 And there are trillion dollar company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4076.9s	4076.9	 I mean, it's not five billion is a big number.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4079.7s	4079.7	 That's not in relation to their market cap and how much cash they throw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4083.3s	4083.3	 What are you 42 million?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4084.6s	4084.6	 I mean, that's a tax payment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4085.7s	4085.7	 It's a quarterly tax pay for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4088.0s	4088.0	 Tremont for us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4091.0s	4091.0	 Or maybe for sex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4092.2s	4092.2	 He's doing pretty well to yum yum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4093.7s	4093.7	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4094.3s	4094.3	 Do we want we promised we do some questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4096.1s	4096.1	 Should we do a couple of questions?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4097.9s	4097.9	 Sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4099.9s	4099.9	 I mean, we could also talk about the FDA and oh my god, the FDA my gosh free bird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4104.4s	4104.4	 You want to leave this free bird?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4105.9s	4105.9	 Tell us about the chaos at the FDA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4107.2s	4107.2	 Well, I don't think it's chaotic like you guys think it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4110.0s	4110.0	 I'll make a counter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4111.6s	4111.6	 Why don't you why don't you make your chaos point first and then I'll make that's not my kind of the what people yeah, people are perceiving this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4118.2s	4118.2	 So like, you know, there've been a couple of these changes in recommendations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4122.2s	4122.2	 Now all of these recommendations that and you know, the these statements and approvals that have come out of the FDA are predicated on these independent advisory panels that are put together to look at research data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4135.4s	4135.4	 Assess the research data and make a recommendation what they think is appropriate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4138.1s	4138.1	 So we saw this happen with the Pfizer booster shot a few weeks ago where initially the advisory panel, which again is made up of independent doctors and scientists who generally don't have any sort of economic interest in the outcome here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4150.3s	4150.3	 They voted 16 to 2 against everyone getting a booster shot and then they voted 18 to 0 in favor of everyone 65 and over and those at risk of getting a booster shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4158.7s	4158.7	 And then recently there was, you know, similar sort of consternation around the Moderna and they ended up looking at data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4164.2s	4164.2	 That indicated that maybe a half dose, which is 50 micrograms instead of a hundred micrograms would have a reasonable amount of efficacy relative to the side effect risk for people over 65 and therefore they made a recommendation to approve that as a booster, which the FDA is now approving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4179.6s	4179.6	 And so again, the way this process is run and I think it's a good process is independent advisors of doctors and scientists come together and the one that recently came together was around this generalized use of aspirin as a heart attack deterrent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4193.9s	4193.9	 Because it thins the blood and limits the risk of people getting heart attacks, but it turns out that such a large percentage of the population or large enough percentage of the population were having bleeding issues where your stomach bleeds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4204.4s	4204.4	 I don't know if you guys have this, but you know, you take ibuprofen or NSAIDs your stomach can bleed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4209.2s	4209.2	 That was causing more of a problem for people than they were seeing in the data in terms of a reduction in heart attack effects for people that were not highly at risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4218.2s	4218.2	 And so they revised the recommendation and said, hey, let's give people that are only at risk and over a certain age aspirin, not just like it give it to everyone over 40 or 50.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4226.8s	4226.8	 And so it took in account new data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4228.9s	4228.9	 And I think this is an important point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4230.8s	4230.8	 Science is messy, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4232.0s	4232.0	 By definition, science is about gathering data, forming a hypothesis, testing again, iterating, restating your hypothesis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4238.6s	4238.6	 And it's designed to be circular.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4240.5s	4240.5	 It's designed to be a learning system, not designed to be a system that defines absolute truth and absolute fact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4246.0s	4246.0	 And it's good to see the FDA doing this work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4247.9s	4247.9	 And it's good to see scientists reviewing new data and changing their recommendations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4251.6s	4251.6	 And we've seen this in health.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4253.9s	4253.9	 We've seen this in the food system and the USDA changing their diet guidelines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4257.8s	4257.8	 And people used to be told, don't eat dietary cholesterol.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4259.9s	4259.9	 It turns out saturated fat is what causes cholesterol in your blood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4262.6s	4262.6	 So there were a lot of changes that kind of emerged as new data was gathered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4266.4s	4266.4	 And I see a lot of carbs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4268.7s	4268.7	 Remember the all carb diets?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4270.3s	4270.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4271.1s	4271.1	 And then they learned and they made a change in those days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4273.5s	4273.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4274.3s	4274.3	 Wait, wait, can we bring that back?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4276.0s	4276.0	 I'm starving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4276.7s	4276.7	 I used to eat pasta every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4278.5s	4278.5	 First it was rice in my 10s and 20s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4281.2s	4281.2	 Oh, I've seen you eat rice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4282.4s	4282.4	 It is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4283.4s	4283.4	 Oh, the shoveling of rice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4285.2s	4285.2	 My Lord.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4285.9s	4285.9	 So Freeberg, I mean, if we're going to be just intellectually eating pizza, if we're going to be intellectually honest about this, the fact that, you know, official health officials can be wrong about positions they've maintained with, I guess, seemingly total certainty for decades.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4301.0s	4301.0	 And now they can revise those positions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4303.0s	4303.0	 I mean, doesn't that lend some credence to some of these like anti-vax arguments when they say, well gee, I'm skeptical about injecting our mRNA into myself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4313.0s	4313.0	 I think it's a totally you just got the episode banned on YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4316.0s	4316.0	 We just got a warning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4317.5s	4317.5	 I'm glad I got the vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4319.0s	4319.0	 I got the Pfizer vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4321.0s	4321.0	 And I think look, it could have saved my life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4322.7s	4322.7	 I mean, I had a very mild case of Delta.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4325.9s	4325.9	 Yeah, I had one of the first breakthroughs because it's so but but it was very mild.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4329.2s	4329.2	 And I think that was because I got Pfizer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4331.6s	4331.6	 I think the risk return was completely worth it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4334.5s	4334.5	 And but but I can also see why people with like five year old like kindergarten age, you know, want to get in might not want to get it for their kids when the upside is absolutely, you know, tiny given that it doesn't really affect five year olds very much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4350.2s	4350.2	 And the downside is not my there's no proven.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4354.0s	4354.0	 How is that any different than the aspirin thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4356.0s	4356.0	 Wait, am I don't know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4356.8s	4356.8	 I don't wish you had gotten really sick with Delta.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4359.7s	4359.7	 Yes, you are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4360.3s	4360.3	 No, but it's not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4361.0s	4361.0	 There's a bunch of people on the left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4362.6s	4362.6	 I don't I don't I don't disagree with the framing that that here's what typically happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4368.6s	4368.6	 The scientists or the FDA panel will say based on the data that we have, this is our recommendation on what should happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4373.9s	4373.9	 And then the framing that people then assume is, oh, this is what they believe to be absolute truth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4378.7s	4378.7	 And with absolute certainty, this is what we have to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4381.1s	4381.1	 And I think the translation layer to the general population is such that this is the Ten Commandments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4385.9s	4385.9	 I came down from Mount Sinai and this is what I'm saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4387.9s	4387.9	 It has to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4388.9s	4388.9	 And the reality is it is based on data and that data changes over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4393.2s	4393.2	 And I think that your point is right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4394.7s	4394.7	 There is no absolute certainty that the Pfizer vaccine is going to be absolutely perfect for everyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4399.7s	4399.7	 And it's going to absolutely reduce the risk more than it increases the risk for people five years old and younger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4406.9s	4406.9	 And it's a it's a very fair point that like but the problem as we've seen on all sides is that the framing is that these things are binary and they're not right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4415.7s	4415.7	 There is a probability distribution of which is defined as the risk and the things that might go wrong and the probability distribution of the benefits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4423.5s	4423.5	 And then people assume that it's just binary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4425.4s	4425.4	 You know, I think you're making an excellent point there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4427.7s	4427.7	 I just want to underscore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4428.7s	4428.7	 Let me kind of translate what you're saying is that the people at the FDA are in these positions who actually understand the science make a cost benefit analysis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4437.0s	4437.0	 And what they're saying in approving it is that the costs outweigh the risks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4440.9s	4440.9	 Sorry, the benefits outweigh the risks of the broad population population.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4444.5s	4444.5	 Okay, by the way, that's why I got the vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4446.9s	4446.9	 I don't know for sure that there's no downsides in 10 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4450.8s	4450.8	 All I know is there's an upside immediately and I benefited from that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4453.9s	4453.9	 So I was very happy to take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4456.2s	4456.2	 But in any event, instead of this complicated cost benefit analysis, the media translates that into good bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4462.5s	4462.5	 It's almost like a moral case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4464.9s	4464.9	 And then the politicians translate that into laws and rules.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4468.4s	4468.4	 And if you question the rules, you're now a bad person because you've opposed the quote unquote good side of the argument.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4475.4s	4475.4	 I mean, for example, Gavin Newsom just signed a bill in California saying that if you are a public school child elementary school, kindergarten, you have to get vaccinated in order to go to a public school, even though the vaccine doesn't even exist for them yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4491.7s	4491.7	 I mean, you could be pro vax, which I guess I would consider myself to be clearly pro vax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4496.3s	4496.3	 I mean, I got my 13 year old got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4498.7s	4498.7	 I support it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4499.4s	4499.4	 I think it's a smart decision to make but to require a five year old to get it in order to go to public schools in California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4505.8s	4505.8	 Wait until we get the FDA data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4507.2s	4507.2	 Here's a question for you, Friedberg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4510.0s	4510.0	 You know, having this one of the complaints has been the FDA restricts progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4515.6s	4515.6	 I mean, I think actually Peter Thiel have this position for a while that we should, you know, just get rid of it and disband it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4521.3s	4521.3	 What do we think about having the FDA being framed as these are recommendations, and then each state gets to make a decision with their local FDA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4530.7s	4530.7	 So then if Colorado or Texas or Florida had a difference of opinion about psychedelics about vaccines, they could run.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4540.6s	4540.6	 It's a really important matter of ethics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4543.0s	4543.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4543.4s	4543.4	 What are your ethics that you believe, you know, should be the guiding principles for how the government plays a role in individuals making choice about their health and their body?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4554.9s	4554.9	 And so if you believe that the government and this is there's no right or wrong here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4558.8s	4558.8	 It's simply a framing of what you believe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4561.0s	4561.0	 If you believe that it's appropriate for the government to make the decision about what's safe and not safe for you as an individual to do, then the FDA should stay in place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4570.3s	4570.3	 and they should have their criteria of when they're ready to make a recommendation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4573.9s	4573.9	 There's enough data to find the benefit and the cost of a particular thing that you might put in your body and then telling you yes, you should or shouldn't do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4582.6s	4582.6	 If you and if not, they're going to take their time and figure that out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4585.6s	4585.6	 Now, if you don't believe that then yes, the FDA should be disbanded and drug companies will go around and they will tell people take this drug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4592.0s	4592.0	 It will save your life and people will take it and there will be there will be people that will suffer from that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4596.4s	4596.4	 There will be people that will have or maybe something in between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4598.9s	4598.9	 There will be people that will die from that federal and remember like the criteria for the FDA is do no harm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4604.6s	4604.6	 So, you know that that is the criteria for a doctor in general.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4607.4s	4607.4	 It is a very difficult criteria to meet when there are costs to a drug or cost to a therapy or treatment when people get chemotherapy for cancer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4615.2s	4615.2	 There are awful deleterious side effects to their body, but the benefit of saving their life and getting rid of the cancer having at least a shot at doing that is great enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4622.9s	4622.9	 The FDA has made a judgment call that that cost and that benefit kind of create an equation that says this is an approved drug now and that's really their goal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4630.6s	4630.6	 And if they don't have enough data and they haven't taken enough time to figure that out, they don't feel comfortable approving a drug and making that recommendation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4636.4s	4636.4	 But then if you let them get out of the way and you let individuals make choice, you could see this being a disgusting free for all where drug companies will hawk snake oil on people and a lot of harm will be caused.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4645.9s	4645.9	 And that's that's the counter argument.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4647.4s	4647.4	 And I'm not saying one is right or one is why I was thinking there might be something that really comes down to what is the role that you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4652.4s	4652.4	 I mean, it's really that what is the role that you want any government, whether it's states or the federal government to play in deciding what you can and can't do with your body and what you can and can't put in your body and ultimately what companies that are making products for you can and can't say to you about the benefit and the cost of that product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4667.6s	4667.6	 And there's no simple solution, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4669.2s	4669.2	 I mean, like I look at Kyrie Irving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4671.4s	4671.4	 I mean, he's basically is not everyone is 200 million dollar by the way, not every individual is equipped to look at the data and make a judgment call on their own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4680.6s	4680.6	 And so the question then is what authority will they look to?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4683.5s	4683.5	 And if the alternative authority that they will look to is not as good as a research team of 18 scientists, then they're probably going to end up getting bad advice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4692.0s	4692.0	 You think you're on the entire area?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4693.6s	4693.6	 What do you think the algebra Kyrie retires?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4695.9s	4695.9	 I think it's 60 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4698.2s	4698.2	 I think he's giving up 200 million dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4700.2s	4700.2	 So he has a 200 million dollar extension.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4702.2s	4702.2	 He gets paid like 30 or 40 million dollars a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4704.5s	4704.5	 He refuses to get the vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4706.0s	4706.0	 He said the reason he's not getting the vaccine is because of all the people who don't have a choice, the pilots who are being forced to get it or not go to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4714.3s	4714.3	 So he is a privilege.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4715.7s	4715.7	 He says, and he wants to make this decision for everybody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4719.1s	4719.1	 He also believes that the earth is flat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4722.2s	4722.2	 Stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4722.7s	4722.7	 That was a joke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4723.7s	4723.7	 He said, I don't think it was a joke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4726.0s	4726.0	 Are you going to from J.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4726.9s	4726.9	 Go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4728.4s	4728.4	 Typing Kyrie Irving flat earth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4729.7s	4729.7	 He talked about how do we know the earth is actually round and basically was a distortion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4734.5s	4734.5	 Yeah, two days later he came out and he was like, you guys miss the trip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4737.4s	4737.4	 Anyways, that's that's not the error there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4739.1s	4739.1	 He's he's what he's unique and wacky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4742.2s	4742.2	 He sounded so I would I would make that decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4745.1s	4745.1	 Why so pejorative?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4746.1s	4746.1	 Like I know I know because it's infuriating that someone disagrees with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4750.2s	4750.2	 You say no because he wanted to come to the next.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4753.4s	4753.4	 These are Taylor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4754.4s	4754.4	 You want to come to the next and Kyrie convinced him to go to Brooklyn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4757.2s	4757.2	 That's the reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4758.0s	4758.0	 Jake out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4758.5s	4758.5	 You're still a member of the media.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4760.1s	4760.1	 You have like a vestigial tail here is that you just bought in to the framework that free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4764.8s	4764.8	 bird laid out, which is the media tastes complicated issues, cost benefit analysis and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4769.6s	4769.6	 turns them into right or wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4771.3s	4771.3	 He didn't come to the next.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4772.9s	4772.9	 He didn't come to the next.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4773.7s	4773.7	 He's bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4774.5s	4774.5	 He now he's bad for not coming to the next.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4776.9s	4776.9	 He sounds to me like a man of conscience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4780.2s	4780.2	 No man of conscience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4781.4s	4781.4	 Who's willing to stand up on principle turned out 200 million dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4784.4s	4784.4	 I got the vaccine for free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4785.8s	4785.8	 I sure as hell wouldn't turn away 200 million dollars not to get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4789.1s	4789.1	 So I mean, 200 million to not take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4792.6s	4792.6	 Would you have taken you have taken it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4794.9s	4794.9	 Maybe I think I'm not taking it for 200 million there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4799.1s	4799.1	 There was a I heard a great story yesterday at the poker table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4802.0s	4802.0	 One of the guys was telling me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4804.9s	4804.9	 It's his backgammon teacher and he says his backgammon teacher or is it in, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4809.7s	4809.7	 good backgammon teacher and a magician blah blah blah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4812.9s	4812.9	 He was asked to get female breast implants for a year for $100,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4823.0s	4823.0	 He did it and he kept them for 20 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4827.3s	4827.3	 That's quite a free roll.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4829.0s	4829.0	 So, you know, the bar for people to do the power for people to do things is really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4833.3s	4833.3	 not that high is really what I took away from that story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4836.9s	4836.9	 And what I think of it from this story is so let's go around the horn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4839.6s	4839.6	 No, but Kyrie is willing to draw the line on something that he believes in and it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4843.7s	4843.7	 going to cost him 200 million dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4845.1s	4845.1	 There's a lot of things that come with all of that noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4849.3s	4849.3	 He should be allowed to make that decision in my opinion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4853.3s	4853.3	 And I don't I don't like the way that he's characterized because I think this is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4856.3s	4856.3	 good human being.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4857.3s	4857.3	 He's a phenomenal basketball player.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4860.0s	4860.0	 Could you imagine how strongly he feels about this if he's willing to walk away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4864.0s	4864.0	 from the game that he loves and that's, you know, been an enormous part of his life?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4868.3s	4868.3	 What is so important to foist on Kyrie Irving the need to get vaccinated?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4873.1s	4873.1	 I mean, it's because in New York City in indoors, you have to there's a vaccine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4877.1s	4877.1	 requirement and he can't play at home games.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4879.2s	4879.2	 He could play in Texas or Houston.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4881.5s	4881.5	 So they've talked about trading him to Houston.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4883.1s	4883.1	 But then when he went to New York and you also can't practice with the team in New
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4886.6s	4886.6	 York, New Jersey, I guess Massachusetts is a bunch of states where you can't go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4890.7s	4890.7	 indoors without a vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4892.2s	4892.2	 They're in close proximity to each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4893.6s	4893.6	 You get the idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4894.2s	4894.2	 I just think we're turning a good thing into which is the vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4898.3s	4898.3	 I genuinely think it's a it's a great thing that I got done so quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4901.3s	4901.3	 It's a miracle of science.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4902.7s	4902.7	 And I think it's helped a lot of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4905.0s	4905.0	 I mean all of us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4905.9s	4905.9	 I mean, it's the thing that's going to end the pandemic largely already has but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4910.4s	4910.4	 we're turning into a bad thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4911.2s	4911.2	 But why were we demanding that these holdouts like every last person must get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4916.6s	4916.6	 vaccinated?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4917.4s	4917.4	 What about what about a flight attendant should a flight attendant before us if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4920.5s	4920.5	 they're on a tiny?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4922.8s	4922.8	 Or should they be work somewhere at you get so much protection by being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4927.1s	4927.1	 vaccinated yourself that I don't think you don't believe in mandates now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4932.4s	4932.4	 Well, I think private companies have the right to to to the NBA is a private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4936.7s	4936.7	 company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4936.9s	4936.9	 I know I get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4937.8s	4937.8	 So but I'm just I'm just starting to really question here whether it's truly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4941.6s	4941.6	 necessary to get every single one of these last holdouts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4944.4s	4944.4	 I just there's something un-American about imposing on free people this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4950.0s	4950.0	 decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=4950.6s	4950.6	 They can't just make up their own mind you in a previous episode said you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=5079.9s	5079.9	 creating the framework for it is that we can use quantum computers to simulate the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=5090.3s	5090.3	 And as a result you could kind of see us creating simulations that resolve certain

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=5112.9s	5112.9	 that if they compressed atmospheric air to 200 times atmospheric pressure and ran it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=5130.4s	5130.4	 And so this was like this amazing invention and it saved the world and fed the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=5133.6s	5133.6	 It's a great book called The Alchemy of Air if anyone's interested in hearing about

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0rCYoD_2E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=84&t=5140.7s	5140.7	 we figured this out.
