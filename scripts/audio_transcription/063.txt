https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=0.0s	0.0	 Look at Freberg. He's like, this is so awkward. I can't wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4.8s	4.8	 He's got literally brought popcorn.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=8.5s	8.5	 You brought popcorn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=9.8s	9.8	 He's like, I want to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=11.2s	11.2	 I have nothing to say today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=12.2s	12.2	 I'm just going to sit here and watch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=13.6s	13.6	 I brought popcorn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=14.6s	14.6	 I got my chili roasted pistachio nuts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=18.2s	18.2	 I'm going to sit back and enjoy the J.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=21.0s	21.0	 Cal Sac.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=30.8s	30.8	 And it said we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=34.6s	34.6	 Love you, besties.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=35.6s	35.6	 Queen of Kin Wands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=39.0s	39.0	 Are we really going to do this as the top story?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=41.3s	41.3	 I mean, this is the third time we've tried to do this story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=45.4s	45.4	 Do we give the background sacks or no?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=47.0s	47.0	 We wouldn't have had to do it over and over again if you didn't act so hysterical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=50.7s	50.7	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=51.5s	51.5	 The first one you killed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=53.4s	53.4	 No, you killed it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=54.6s	54.6	 No, the first one you killed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=56.2s	56.2	 Yeah, because it wasn't even on the docket and it wasn't it wasn't even newsworthy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=60.3s	60.3	 OK, and the second one I killed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=62.3s	62.3	 Because you came across like a stark raving lunatic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=65.6s	65.6	 I spiked it the second time because I was so infuriated by your cavalier attitude towards it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=71.0s	71.0	 What are you worried about my attitude for?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=72.6s	72.6	 Why don't you just focus on making your own good points?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=75.5s	75.5	 Here's the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=76.9s	76.9	 I was so correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=79.0s	79.0	 I was so correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=80.2s	80.2	 The two of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=81.1s	81.1	 Let him go, Tomas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=82.2s	82.2	 Let him go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=83.5s	83.5	 You guys got popcorn?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=84.2s	84.2	 Let's hear this idiot try to blame his own hysteria on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=88.0s	88.0	 You said that January 6 was overblown and of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=92.6s	92.6	 No, I said it was a disgrace.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=94.6s	94.6	 I said it was an embarrassment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=96.3s	96.3	 It was an embarrassment to the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=97.6s	97.6	 I said it was wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=99.0s	99.0	 But you want to inflate it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=100.4s	100.4	 You're you're engaging in classic Washington threat inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=104.3s	104.3	 Nope.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=104.8s	104.8	 And and there's two problems with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=107.2s	107.2	 One is you're going to take your eye off the ball of the real issues facing the country,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=112.1s	112.1	 like inflation, the economy and economic anxiety, like COVID, like crime, like schools.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=119.6s	119.6	 I mean, these are the issues that Americans care about, not, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=123.2s	123.2	 a riot that happened over a year ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=125.3s	125.3	 And if you and the Democrats keep talking about this and focus on it, on MSNBC,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=130.2s	130.2	 to the exclusion of the issues that really matter, I'll see you in November
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=133.6s	133.6	 because you're going to get slaughtered in this midterm election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=136.0s	136.0	 It's going to be a landslide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=137.3s	137.3	 But the other problem with it is with this threat inflation is that it justifies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=141.6s	141.6	 the expansion of surveillance powers and prosecutorial powers by the Justice Department,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=146.6s	146.6	 by the, you know, by the by the Justice Department and other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=150.6s	150.6	 branches of our government who want to basically go after, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=153.7s	153.7	 this the so-called domestic terrorism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=156.6s	156.6	 That will lead to an infringement on civil liberties, just like the expansion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=160.6s	160.6	 of those agencies did after 9-11.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=163.5s	163.5	 And so I think we should all be concerned about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=165.6s	165.6	 Now, look, are these oath keepers a bunch of idiots?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=168.2s	168.2	 Yeah, there were 11 oath keepers at that rally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=171.0s	171.0	 They broke into the Capitol.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=172.2s	172.2	 Wait a minute, wait a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=172.8s	172.8	 You're saying?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=173.2s	173.2	 They should be prosecuted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=174.2s	174.2	 Wait, wait, wait a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=175.0s	175.0	 You're saying an old fat guy with an eye patch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=180.0s	180.0	 and a hat that says oath keeper lifetime member is not credible to you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=184.5s	184.5	 Exactly. I mean, look, this is these guys are they're not unlike the Antifa,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=191.3s	191.3	 you know, people in Portland who are trying to burn down buildings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=194.9s	194.9	 or or Chase Abudin's parents who are domestic terrorists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=198.6s	198.6	 I mean, yeah, this is a small number of knuckleheads who broke into the Capitol.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=202.7s	202.7	 They should be prosecuted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=204.7s	204.7	 They're they're guilty of saying this leader is saying intemperate things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=209.0s	209.0	 But was this going to be a coup to take over the Capitol?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=212.2s	212.2	 I don't I don't think so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=213.4s	213.4	 OK, let me cut the story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=214.0s	214.0	 If you want to focus on that, the exclusion of the real issues facing the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=217.7s	217.7	 Like I said, this landslide in November, this red wave is going to be even bigger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=221.1s	221.1	 Just to your point about my focus every week here on the number one tech podcast in the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=226.6s	226.6	 and on the number six tech podcast in the world this week in startups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=229.6s	229.6	 I focus on all of those issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=231.5s	231.5	 But let's read because we can chew gum and walk at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=235.1s	235.1	 Let's read what happened on Thursday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=237.2s	237.2	 The FBI arrested 11 members of the Oath Keepers on sedition charges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=241.2s	241.2	 And the House Committee subpoenaed Facebook, Google, Reddit and Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=244.2s	244.2	 after insufficient responses to the January 6 riots or insurrection,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=247.8s	247.8	 whichever term you prefer the leader of the Oath Keepers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=253.0s	253.0	 which is an organization that claims over 30,000 members primarily in the military and police.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=258.8s	258.8	 OK, well, hold on a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=259.8s	259.8	 If this was their big moment to stage a coup and take over the government,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=263.1s	263.1	 why were only 11 of the 30,000 there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=265.7s	265.7	 The 11 were indicted, David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=267.4s	267.4	 There were.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=267.9s	267.9	 How many were there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=269.2s	269.2	 Well, we don't know yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=270.1s	270.1	 But last week, you said last week, you said there was no coordinated attack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=274.7s	274.7	 And now we have proof.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=275.7s	275.7	 No, no, no, that's not what I said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=277.7s	277.7	 Look, you can't veto the segment from last week and then try to claim that I said certain things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=283.9s	283.9	 Let me just fit it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=284.5s	284.5	 Can I get through the story or keep interrupting?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=286.6s	286.6	 My God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=287.3s	287.3	 OK, from the end, you're complaining about interruption.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=289.8s	289.8	 OK, that's another interruption.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=291.5s	291.5	 May I finish it without before interruption or would you like to just keep monologuing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=295.0s	295.0	 What are you reading?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=296.2s	296.2	 Why don't you just give us the link so that the audience can just go get the actual story?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=300.2s	300.2	 That's what I'm trying to do, but you keep interrupting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=301.6s	301.6	 So here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=302.1s	302.1	 While certain Oath Keeper members and affiliates inside Washington, D.C.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=304.6s	304.6	 breached the Capitol grounds and buildings, others remain stationed just outside the city in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=309.4s	309.4	 QRF teams.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=311.0s	311.0	 These are quick response teams that had weapons and they transported firearms into Washington,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=317.6s	317.6	 D.C. And these in support operations were aimed at using force to stop the law,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=323.0s	323.0	 full transfer of presidential power, according to our Department of Justice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=327.0s	327.0	 which is a majority Republican, obviously, law enforcement skews, Republican.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=331.4s	331.4	 Yes, it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=332.5s	332.5	 A portion of the Oath Keepers communication occurred on Signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=335.3s	335.3	 You think the FBI is pro-Republican?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=336.1s	336.1	 Are you going to keep interrupting me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=337.4s	337.4	 Oh my God, can I just read two sentences, Dave?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=339.2s	339.2	 Get a taste of your own medicine, pal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=340.6s	340.6	 OK, fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=341.2s	341.2	 Signal is an encrypted chat app that's not supposed to have any back doors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=344.2s	344.2	 but obviously there are some plant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=345.9s	345.9	 Here are some of Rhodes's comments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=347.8s	347.8	 We aren't getting through this without a civil war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=350.6s	350.6	 Too late for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=351.4s	351.4	 Prepare your mind, body and spirit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=352.8s	352.8	 It will be a bloody and desperate fight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=355.0s	355.0	 We're going to have to fight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=356.1s	356.1	 This cannot be avoided.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=358.0s	358.0	 If we want to make the January 6th stuff relevant, first of all, let me just say I see that primarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=361.9s	361.9	 as a media story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=362.9s	362.9	 What happened happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=364.2s	364.2	 Obviously, it was a disgrace and embarrassment of Black Eye for the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=367.9s	367.9	 I'm not supporting or defending anyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=371.1s	371.1	 I tend to think these Oath Keepers, it was not like a super organized concerted effort
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=376.9s	376.9	 to take over the government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=379.6s	379.6	 It's basically a bunch of loud mouths who engage in a riot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=383.4s	383.4	 Maybe there was more planning and preparation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=385.0s	385.0	 Fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=385.5s	385.5	 The court case will bear it out and if they can prove that it was what you said, it was great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=390.3s	390.3	 Let them go to jail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=391.0s	391.0	 I have no desire to defend them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=392.6s	392.6	 But I also think that in the grand scheme of things, this whole thing has been blown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=396.0s	396.0	 completely out of proportion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=397.1s	397.1	 If you watch MSNBC, it's all January 6th all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=402.9s	402.9	 If Democrats are going to focus on this issue for the next 10 months and who Roger Stone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=407.4s	407.4	 was photographed on a sidewalk with, which was the big story the other day, this red
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=411.5s	411.5	 wave in November is going to be an even bigger wave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=413.5s	413.5	 I'm just telling you right now because it's not what the average voter in the country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=416.9s	416.9	 cares about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=417.7s	417.7	 I think you're right about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=418.9s	418.9	 I think you're right about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=419.7s	419.7	 I'll agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=420.6s	420.6	 I think MSNBC is focused on this and Fox is focused on fake voter fraud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=425.5s	425.5	 And we've been pretty clear here that none of us agree with either of the extremes of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=430.3s	430.3	 media coverage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=432.0s	432.0	 I do think this is an issue worth resolving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=434.1s	434.1	 What fake voter fraud are you talking about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=436.2s	436.2	 The guy who's obsessed right now with voter fraud is Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=439.0s	439.0	 He just gave a speech, a very intemperate speech saying that if you don't support his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=443.7s	443.7	 new voting rights acts, that you're on the side of Bull Connor and Jefferson Davis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=448.4s	448.4	 There were some political calculus there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=450.0s	450.0	 He had to do that because he was also trying to basically bolster the ability to get this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=454.8s	454.8	 filibuster thing passed in the Senate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=456.6s	456.6	 So he basically had to play a relatively weak hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=460.5s	460.5	 And again, what happened again legislatively is that his own party said no, enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=466.6s	466.6	 In this case, it was Kristin Sinema who basically said no, none of this is going forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=469.4s	469.4	
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=469.4s	469.4	 Well, Sinema I mentioned won't support amending the filibuster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=472.0s	472.0	 So this thing was DOA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=473.9s	473.9	 We said it was DOA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=475.5s	475.5	 When the bill back better, bill collapsed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=477.4s	477.4	 We said they were going to try and pivot to voting rights to change the subject even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=480.5s	480.5	 though it was DOA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=481.5s	481.5	 But there is something that Biden could do or could have done that I think would be a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=486.5s	486.5	 bipartisan reform, which is to reform the Electoral Count Act.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=489.4s	489.4	 I mean, what happened in November, if you're concerned about Trump and the potential to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=495.7s	495.7	 subvert the election and the way he tried to influence Pence to stop the counting of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=500.1s	500.1	 the electors, if you're concerned about all of that, there is a fix for that, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=504.2s	504.2	 the Electoral Count Act of 1887.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=507.0s	507.0	 It's completely antiquated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=508.3s	508.3	 Obviously, it's been around for over 100 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=510.5s	510.5	 There is bipartisan support for fixing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=512.3s	512.3	 The Wall Street Journal editorial page has come out for months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=515.1s	515.1	 Explain what that is to the audience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=516.4s	516.4	 Well, it's just a law that governs how these electors in the electoral college get counted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=523.4s	523.4	 up and certified so that the election gets certified.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=526.7s	526.7	 So David Brooks had that piece that Trimosh shared in the New York Times, which is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=531.0s	531.0	 problem we have right now is not in the actual voting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=534.2s	534.2	 It's in the...if you're worried about what happened in this past November, it's in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=539.0s	539.0	 certification not the voting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=541.4s	541.4	 And what Brooks was writing about is there's a lot of social science saying that a lot of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=547.3s	547.3	 rules that Democrats and Republicans are really focused on around the convenience of the election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=553.2s	553.2	 don't really influence the number of people who vote.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=555.7s	555.7	 People who vote want...people who want to vote, vote.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=557.8s	557.8	 People who don't, don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=559.7s	559.7	 We're getting hung up on the wrong thing, which is these voter ID laws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=563.0s	563.0	 What really matters is the certification of the electoral college.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=567.4s	567.4	 And you could find...Biden could find...I think there's a number of Republicans who would support
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=573.0s	573.0	 a clarification of that law and updating of it so that what potentially could have happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=579.0s	579.0	 in January, if Pence had gone along with this plan to basically reject the accounting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=583.4s	583.4	 of the electors...I mean, everyone understood that that was just ceremonial, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=587.2s	587.2	 Well, yeah. What do you think of that plan?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=588.7s	588.7	 What did you think of Trump's plan?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=590.0s	590.0	 I think that Trump had a right to air his grievances in court.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=593.7s	593.7	 But once the court threw out his claims and rejected them, and once the Supreme Court
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=598.9s	598.9	 denied sociality, it was over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=601.5s	601.5	 It was over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=602.3s	602.3	 The Supreme Court has the final word in our democracy about legal matters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=607.0s	607.0	 And so, no, Pence never had the authority or the ability under the Electoral Count Act to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=613.3s	613.3	 reject the counting of the electors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=614.6s	614.6	 That whole process is ceremonial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=617.8s	617.8	 But the mere fact that this isn't even an issue suggests that we should fix it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=621.9s	621.9	 We should go back and fix the Electoral Count Act of 1887.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=625.6s	625.6	 So, and look, Biden could have gotten 60 votes for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=630.0s	630.0	 I think that was very doable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=631.2s	631.2	 He can get votes for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=632.6s	632.6	 He can also get votes to stop the insider trading of members of Congress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=639.1s	639.1	 He could get that done too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=640.2s	640.2	 So why isn't he focused on things where he can actually get a bipartisan majority?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=644.6s	644.6	 His one big legislative success as president has been the infrastructure bill, where he got a bunch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=649.9s	649.9	 of Republican support.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=650.8s	650.8	 Which is a pretty big win, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=652.4s	652.4	 Those are the types of issues he should be focused on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=654.8s	654.8	 And instead, he's giving these speeches saying that anyone who disagrees with the progressive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=659.9s	659.9	 agenda on voting rights is basically George Wallace or Bull Connor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=663.3s	663.3	 Did you guys hear his speech the other day on CNBC about COVID?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=667.8s	667.8	 I mean, he was so incoherent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=669.7s	669.7	 It was kind of scary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=671.8s	671.8	 It feels like he's in cognitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=673.3s	673.3	 The cognitive decline is, you know, I voted for the guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=676.6s	676.6	 And he needed to get Trump out of office.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=677.8s	677.8	 I thought that was an existential risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=679.0s	679.0	 But man, he is cognitively declining quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=681.5s	681.5	 I mean, I think the craziest thing about COVID was this Rachel Walensky interview.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=685.0s	685.0	 I mean, like, why does it take two years into a pandemic to tell us what we kind of anecdotally knew?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=691.0s	691.0	 But if we had known upfront or sooner, we would have completely...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=694.8s	694.8	 Rachel Walensky does an interview.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=696.1s	696.1	 She's the head of the CDC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=697.2s	697.2	 And she said, well, it turns out that 75% of all the deaths because of COVID were people that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=702.9s	702.9	 suffered from at least four comorbidities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=706.6s	706.6	 At least four.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=707.4s	707.4	 I saw that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=707.9s	707.9	 I was fell out of my chair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=709.2s	709.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=710.0s	710.0	 It wasn't all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=710.7s	710.7	 It was, I think it was a subset defined by, it might have been like vaccinated deaths or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=714.5s	714.5	 something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=715.2s	715.2	 It was one study.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=716.6s	716.6	 But yes, that was basically the conclusion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=719.1s	719.1	 Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=719.9s	719.9	 It's significant comorbidities among people who died.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=722.2s	722.2	 And so if we had known that, don't you think, I mean, Friedberg, you tell me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=725.9s	725.9	 but wouldn't we have just changed our response to just mask and just kind of like start living
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=730.2s	730.2	 our normal lives and people with four comorbidities or people at a certain age or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=733.6s	733.6	 immunocompromised should have stayed home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=735.4s	735.4	 And we would be in a very different situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=737.5s	737.5	 So, I mean, I understand, Jason, that Biden didn't...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=741.4s	741.4	 The last few speeches have been a little tight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=745.2s	745.2	 I think, look, the Quinnipac poll, Nick, you can post it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=749.4s	749.4	 I mean, look, his ratings are just...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=751.8s	751.8	 Plummeting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=752.5s	752.5	 Plummeting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=753.3s	753.3	 I mean, it's down to Trump levels, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=754.7s	754.7	 Every week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=755.3s	755.3	 And so he is definitely searching for a handful of wins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=759.1s	759.1	 I don't think he strategically found the right ones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=762.6s	762.6	 He could have done something on certifying the electoral college.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=766.2s	766.2	 He could certainly do something right now on insider trading laws for members of Congress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=773.2s	773.2	 But instead, we're focusing on all these random things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=775.3s	775.3	 But anyway, sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=776.1s	776.1	 He can't get the insider trading thing past Pelosi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=778.7s	778.7	 But yeah, I think it is something that would get a huge bipartisan majority.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=783.0s	783.0	 Look, she's going to lose anyway, so he might as well just throw under the bus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=787.1s	787.1	 You're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=787.8s	787.8	 This is about his political salvation over hers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=789.8s	789.8	 By the way, you guys saw this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=791.4s	791.4	 I mentioned this in the group chat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=793.4s	793.4	 Someone floated the trial balloon of dumping Kamala Harris and replacing her with Liz Cheney.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=798.0s	798.0	 This is how bad things have gotten for the Democrats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=800.6s	800.6	 Wow, I mean, we were having a...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=801.9s	801.9	 They floated a trial balloon of Biden Cheney in 2014.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=806.2s	806.2	 A crossover ticket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=807.4s	807.4	 I...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=807.9s	807.9	 We talked about this for a couple of years in private and poker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=811.4s	811.4	 I think a crossover ticket is what the country needs to kind of get back to center.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=815.7s	815.7	 And I know it's a crazy concept and it's a 1% chance, but I kind of like the crossover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=819.8s	819.8	 But things have gotten so bad for the Democrats now that...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=824.3s	824.3	 I sort of said, Sachs floated this or pre-floated it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=827.3s	827.3	 We had a little debate on the Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=828.8s	828.8	 But I don't know if you remember two or three episodes ago, Sachs said, hey, listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=832.0s	832.0	 there's going to be a new appreciation for Clinton.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=834.9s	834.9	 And not 10 days later, the Wall Street Journal and a bunch of people are floating Hillary coming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=839.7s	839.7	 back to run.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=840.3s	840.3	 Wow, I said Bill Clinton.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=842.5s	842.5	 I didn't mention Hillary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=843.4s	843.4	 I know that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=843.9s	843.9	 But I think either you are in your star chamber and doing a pre-float on all ends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=849.9s	849.9	 So then the backups can then pump Hillary as that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=855.1s	855.1	 Or it's just people are listening to you and you're that influential.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=857.6s	857.6	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=858.2s	858.2	 What I'm proposing is that Biden engage in Clintonian, by which I mean Bill Clintonian,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=863.5s	863.5	 triangulation, which is he does not have the votes in Congress to enact a progressive agenda.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=869.2s	869.2	 He should be looking for bipartisan wins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=871.2s	871.2	 He did with the infrastructure bill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=872.6s	872.6	 He could do it with this insider trading thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=874.4s	874.4	 He could do it on the Electoral Count Act.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=876.3s	876.3	 These are things that would be progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=880.5s	880.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=880.8s	880.8	 China policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=881.5s	881.5	 And importantly, momentum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=882.9s	882.9	 Momentum going into 2024.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=885.4s	885.4	 And maybe good for Americans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=887.5s	887.5	 His China policy, the fact that he came out with a statement on the Uyghurs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=891.0s	891.0	 I thought was very strong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=893.1s	893.1	 It's one of the stronger things he did, but it's not coming up in the polls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=896.0s	896.0	 And I think that whole Republicans interested in Hillary to run again is a sad news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=900.2s	900.2	 Nobody cares about what's happening to the Uyghurs, okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=902.6s	902.6	 You bring it up because you really care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=904.1s	904.1	 And I think that's nice that you care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=905.9s	905.9	 The rest of us don't care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=907.2s	907.2	 I'm just very hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=909.2s	909.2	 You're saying you personally don't care?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=910.6s	910.6	 I'm telling you a very hard, ugly truth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=912.4s	912.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=912.7s	912.7	 Of all the things that I care about, yes, it is below my line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=916.4s	916.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=916.7s	916.7	 Of all the things that I care about, it is below my line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=920.0s	920.0	 Disappointing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=920.6s	920.6	 Well, I think people, if you explain to them what's happening to the Uyghurs in China,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=923.9s	923.9	 they care, but it's not top of mind for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=926.5s	926.5	 That's not caring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=927.4s	927.4	 Right now, as they go to the grocery store and the shelves are empty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=930.4s	930.4	 Sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=930.8s	930.8	 That I care about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=932.0s	932.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=932.6s	932.6	 I care about the fact that our economy could turn on a dime if China invades Taiwan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=937.1s	937.1	 I care about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=938.2s	938.2	 I care about climate change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=940.2s	940.2	 I care about America's crippling and decrepit healthcare infrastructure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=946.1s	946.1	 But if you're asking me, do I care about a segment of a class of people in another country,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=950.3s	950.3	 not until we can take care of ourselves, will I prioritize them over us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=954.8s	954.8	 And I think a lot of people believe that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=956.8s	956.8	 And I'm sorry if that's a hard truth to hear, but every time I say that I care about the Uyghurs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=961.9s	961.9	 I'm really just lying if I don't really care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=964.2s	964.2	 And so I'd rather not lie to you and tell you the truth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=966.0s	966.0	 It's not a priority for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=967.2s	967.2	 And my response to that is I think it's a sad state of affairs when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=970.5s	970.5	 human rights as a concept globally, you know, falls beneath, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=976.5s	976.5	 tactical and strategic issues that we have to have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=978.8s	978.8	 We need to have a high watermark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=980.7s	980.7	 That's another luxury belief.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=982.1s	982.1	 I don't believe believing in the human declaration of human rights that Eleanor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=985.6s	985.6	 Roosevelt created with the United Nations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=987.2s	987.2	 I don't think it's a luxury belief to believe that all humans should have a basic set of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=990.2s	990.2	 human rights.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=990.8s	990.8	 I think it's a luxury belief.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=992.3s	992.3	 Far from it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=992.6s	992.6	 The reason I think it's a luxury belief is we don't do enough domestically to actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=996.1s	996.1	 express that view in real tangible ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=998.5s	998.5	 So until we actually clean up our own house, the idea that we step outside of our borders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1003.5s	1003.5	 with, you know, with us sort of like morally virtue signaling about somebody else's human
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1009.7s	1009.7	 rights track record is deplorable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1011.4s	1011.4	 Look at the number of black and brown men that are far from deplorable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1014.8s	1014.8	 Look at the number of black and brown men that are incarcerated for absolutely ridiculous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1019.0s	1019.0	 crimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1019.6s	1019.6	 I don't know if you saw this past week, but there is a person that was released from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1023.4s	1023.4	 jail because he couldn't even be protected in jail because in some of these cells, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1027.4s	1027.4	 run these fight clubs inside of Rikers Island that are basically tacitly endorsed by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1032.3s	1032.3	 corrections officers that don't do anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1034.1s	1034.1	 And the difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1034.8s	1034.8	 So hold on, Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1035.9s	1035.9	 So if you want to talk about the human rights of people, I think we have a responsibility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1041.8s	1041.8	 to take care of our own backyard first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1044.9s	1044.9	 First.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1046.1s	1046.1	 And then we can go and basically morally tell other people how they should be running
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1051.0s	1051.0	 their own countries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1052.1s	1052.1	 The difference is Chamath, saying what you just said in China or Saudi Arabia would put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1056.9s	1056.9	 you in jail and get you 100 lashes and you would be tortured for a decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1061.0s	1061.0	 We here in the United States are far from perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1062.7s	1062.7	 We still have the death penalty, which is against the United Declaration of Human Rights,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1065.6s	1065.6	 which we signed, which Eleanor Roosevelt created in the UN.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1068.6s	1068.6	 And we propagated as Americans around the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1071.8s	1071.8	 We started that Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1074.0s	1074.0	 And we can have these discussions about being better in this country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1077.8s	1077.8	 And the what about ism that you're proposing is so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1083.9s	1083.9	 disproportional to the equivalent of the Holocaust going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1088.0s	1088.0	 We're talking about a million Uighurs in concentration camps right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1091.0s	1091.0	 To talk about what we have here that we need to fix and compare it to that or to Saudi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1095.9s	1095.9	 Arabia whipping bloggers and throwing gay people off roofs for being gay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1100.4s	1100.4	 These two things are not morally comparable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1102.7s	1102.7	 They are very far and we need to have open discussions and talk about human rights all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1107.0s	1107.0	 the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1108.2s	1108.2	 Because if we do not talk about it all the time, then your position, which is I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1112.8s	1112.8	 have time for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1113.4s	1113.4	 I want to solve my problems then gives the green light to dictators everywhere that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1118.2s	1118.2	 nobody's watching vigilance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1120.5s	1120.5	 And that's what I find.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1121.6s	1121.6	 And I think we need to hold on a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1123.3s	1123.3	 Your position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1123.9s	1123.9	 That's not what I said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1124.8s	1124.8	 And that's not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1125.9s	1125.9	 You said you can't get up for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1127.3s	1127.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1127.9s	1127.9	 So tell me how are you saying that the situation with the Uighurs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1133.0s	1133.0	 Is the same as the Holocaust?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1134.4s	1134.4	 People who are Jewish are making that comparison.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1136.9s	1136.9	 You never know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1137.5s	1137.5	 I'm asking you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1139.0s	1139.0	 I think it is comparable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1140.3s	1140.3	 There are upwards of a million people in a concentration camp right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1143.9s	1143.9	 This is getting to numbers that are actually comparable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1147.0s	1147.0	 It is actually a valid comparison.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1148.5s	1148.5	 You're saying there are a million people in a concentration camp?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1152.0s	1152.0	 That is the numbers that human rights organizations are saying between 300,000 and a million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1156.8s	1156.8	 people are incarcerated right now being tortured, raped and in doing forced sterilization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1162.6s	1162.6	 reeducation and when they're released are being tracked in ghettos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1166.7s	1166.7	 And so are you saying the entire world is basically decided that that doesn't matter?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1174.8s	1174.8	 You just said you can't get up for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1176.1s	1176.1	 I'm talking about you specifically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1178.6s	1178.6	 Who is getting up for it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1179.5s	1179.5	 I am very up on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1180.5s	1180.5	 I talk about it all the time every week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1182.0s	1182.0	 What about the US government?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1183.0s	1183.0	 What are they doing about it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1184.9s	1184.9	 Biden just said we are going to do a ban and we are going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1189.3s	1189.3	 sanction companies that do business in that region.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1191.8s	1191.8	 So Apple and Tesla?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1194.4s	1194.4	 I think there will be increased pressure on all companies that are engaging in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1199.3s	1199.3	 Well, it's goods that are sourced from those areas, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1202.6s	1202.6	 Correct. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1203.6s	1203.6	 It's not doing business there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1205.4s	1205.4	 It's if your supply chain comes from that area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1208.2s	1208.2	 Correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1208.4s	1208.4	 And it's a first step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1210.0s	1210.0	 We won't buy Nazi goods but we'll sell our iPhones into Nazi Germany.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1215.3s	1215.3	 Well, if you want to have a discussion about this, it's how do we disengage from China?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1219.8s	1219.8	 We've had this discussion here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1222.0s	1222.0	 What amount of time will it take to disengage from countries that have brutal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1226.6s	1226.6	 dictatorships that are committing human rights atrocities?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1228.9s	1228.9	 But again, look, I think I'm spending a lot of time and money actually trying to fortify
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1234.6s	1234.6	 America's supply chain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1235.8s	1235.8	 You guys know about some of the things that I'm doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1237.4s	1237.4	 Absolutely. It's fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1238.3s	1238.3	 I'm not doing that from a moral perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1240.9s	1240.9	 I'm doing that from a practical capitalist perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1243.4s	1243.4	 I think the jobs are better served for Americans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1245.9s	1245.9	 And I think that we should have the ability to build our own businesses,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1248.6s	1248.6	 just like China has the right to do for themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1251.4s	1251.4	 Without the risk of these things being undercut by policies that we don't understand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1255.4s	1255.4	 which is effectively what you do when you outsource your supply chain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1258.9s	1258.9	 to countries where you're not 100% aligned with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1261.3s	1261.3	 Yeah, and they're dictatorships.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1263.6s	1263.6	 So again, I'm not even sure that China is a dictatorship the way that you want to call it that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1270.8s	1270.8	 Again, I think-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1271.4s	1271.4	 Communist country that's in the name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1273.0s	1273.0	 Look, you have to understand, Jason, there are a set of checks and balances here on China that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1278.5s	1278.5	 at the end of the day, I don't think that I have the moral absolutism to judge China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1283.2s	1283.2	 And I would say that when NATO is silent, the United Nations is silent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1287.0s	1287.0	 all of Western Europe is silent, and America is effectively silent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1290.3s	1290.3	 that this issue may be small data points being extrapolated in a way to create a narrative that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1295.4s	1295.4	 may be not be true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1296.3s	1296.3	 And if it is true, Jason, there is a responsibility for those body politics to do something because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1301.1s	1301.1	 that is the early warning signal that the rest of the world uses to say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1305.0s	1305.0	 okay, hold on, let me reprioritize my list of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1308.7s	1308.7	 So I guess what I'm saying is I am not going to be an armchair journalist on this topic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1313.0s	1313.0	 nor am I going to be the armchair human rights advocate for the world,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1316.2s	1316.2	 because I just don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1317.5s	1317.5	 I can focus on the things that I know about, build the things that I know about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1321.0s	1321.0	 And if something really does get red light status, then other parties will do something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1326.4s	1326.4	 And again, I just want to be clear, NATO is silent, United Nations is silent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1331.6s	1331.6	 America is silent, a press release doesn't change the actual technical posture on these topics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1336.6s	1336.6	 Okay, if that if your position is that human rights matters to you, if government,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1341.0s	1341.0	 large government organizations or politicians give you the green light to care about it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1345.5s	1345.5	 that's fine. I care about it intrinsically every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1348.2s	1348.2	 Great. I'm fine with you doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1349.6s	1349.6	 I thought there was a segue there talking about the Ray Dalio thing that Friedberg cares about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1353.3s	1353.3	 I mean, this is, I mean, this debate that you're having between kind of realism and idealism and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1359.6s	1359.6	 foreign policy is sort of what Dalio tackles, right, Friedberg?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1363.3s	1363.3	 Look, I mean, it sounds to me like there's, let's just say a red herring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1370.2s	1370.2	 There always needs to be, as Jamath points out, a narrative on framing our enemy when,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1376.2s	1376.2	 you know, you're running out of land.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1377.9s	1377.9	 I mean, you guys saw this, was it a journal article or New York Times article that came out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1382.0s	1382.0	 today that US intelligence revealed that Putin had actually put some actors into the Eastern Ukraine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1391.5s	1391.5	 to set up for a reason to have a response and therefore an excuse to invade the Ukraine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1397.1s	1397.1	 So he was trying to create a bit of a fireworks show to give him an excuse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1401.8s	1401.8	 We always need a narrative that we can sell to our, you know, our citizens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1409.4s	1409.4	 And so, you know, there's not going to be a lot of, you know, patting on the back of China right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1415.0s	1415.0	 As we've talked about, there is this, you know, overarching multi-hundred year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1419.4s	1419.4	 economic cycle, you know, call it geopolitical cycle that the United States and China are about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1424.6s	1424.6	 to clash on. And in order for them to clash effectively, we need to get the narrative right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1428.9s	1428.9	 which is to paint them as the bad guy and to make things evil.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1431.3s	1431.3	 And look, I mean, you may take your ethical framework and say that they are bad and you may
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1435.3s	1435.3	 be able to take other parts of your ethical framework and looking objectively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1438.6s	1438.6	 call some countries that you consider good, bad as well, depending on what story you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1443.4s	1443.4	 to tell yourself and what story you want to be told. And I think that's what's going on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1447.6s	1447.6	 and will continue to go on for a long period of time. And this weaker thing, as Chamath pointed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1451.9s	1451.9	 out, how do you measure on an absolute basis human rights? I don't think that there's a way to do so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1457.0s	1457.0	 Whether it's one person getting tortured publicly in a street or a hundred thousand people being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1462.4s	1462.4	 suppressed economically and not being able to get jobs, it's hard to say what is appropriate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1467.2s	1467.2	 what is not, what is evil, what is not. At the end of the day, we create narratives and that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1472.3s	1472.3	 narrative allows the bigger picture to kind of play itself out. And I think that's what's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1477.0s	1477.0	 on largely. And I don't think we're going to hear a lot of good news about China for the next decade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1483.1s	1483.1	 from any politician in the United States or anyone that wants to defend our political and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1487.9s	1487.9	 economic interests globally, which are certainly being challenged by China right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1491.9s	1491.9	 Yeah. I don't know. That's my diatribe about the Dalio. Look, Dalio obviously does a great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1498.3s	1498.3	 job of kind of simplifying and eloquently stating what's going on. But I think this is one of many,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1504.1s	1504.1	 many manifestations of it. You need only read what the UN Amnesty International,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1508.6s	1508.6	 Human Rights Watch, The Guardian, The New York Times, you know, this is not up for question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1513.5s	1513.5	 Why do you think you're so wound up about this and you're not wound up about what's going on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1517.3s	1517.3	 in Somalia? Oh, no. Or you're not wound up about what's going on in Saudi Arabia?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1521.6s	1521.6	 Or you're not wound up about what's going on in Eastern Ukraine?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1525.8s	1525.8	 Hold on a second. There are human rights violations all over the world. I commented on them and I have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1530.2s	1530.2	 commented on them for decades since I worked at Amnesty International, which is where I started
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1534.9s	1534.9	 my career. I've been passionate about this since the age of 18 or 19. When I worked at Amnesty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1539.2s	1539.2	 International, you said that you cannot grade these things, right? You just said like, it's hard to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1544.7s	1544.7	 compare these things. And this is a problem. Like, you can actually do that. There are human rights
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1550.1s	1550.1	 violations, like freedom of speech, which, you know, is a great aspiration. But we would say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1555.9s	1555.9	 torture, murder, systematic rape, and sterilization are more intense and horrific than just freedom of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1563.0s	1563.0	 speech. So if you look at Hong Kong, when they shut down Apple News, that's one level of human
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1567.7s	1567.7	 rights, right? People have lost their ability. But again, you're telling stories, hundreds of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1573.1s	1573.1	 these are not stories. These are facts. Apple News was shut down, you're telling a fact about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1578.0s	1578.0	 a particular a particular set of experiences that are particularly harming a set of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1583.0s	1583.0	 Let me give you another fact. In the United States, where we have a population of let's be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1587.7s	1587.7	 generous and say 400 million people, 2.3 million or 40 million, 340 million Americans, 2.3 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1595.6s	1595.6	 of whom are incarcerated. Absolutely. In China, with a population of 1.4 billion, 1.7 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1602.4s	1602.4	 Chinese are incarcerated. Absolutely something we have to do. Where is human rights being violated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1607.1s	1607.1	 on an absolute basis? It's a very difficult conversation to use facts and figures, because at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1613.0s	1613.0	 the end of the day, there's a lot of data that can be pointed the other way. And so it all comes down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1617.6s	1617.6	 to narrative. And that narrative always has an objective, which is what are you trying to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1621.5s	1621.5	 people to believe? And what are you trying to get them to get behind and get to do? Yes. And what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1625.4s	1625.4	 are you trying to justify? Yes. And the action... They don't have a drug problem over there because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1629.7s	1629.7	 they killed all the drug dealers, now put them up against the wall and shot them. So, you know...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1633.8s	1633.8	 They just send their fentanyl here. That's fair enough. But I'm just saying, look, and it's a very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1639.2s	1639.2	 good point, which is you can actually take the data and you can slice it and tell different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1642.5s	1642.5	 stories around it. But at the end of the day, it's very hard to say there's good and there's evil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1646.9s	1646.9	 that we have to go and attack. And that is what is going... Oh, I never said attack. I never said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1650.9s	1650.9	 attack. I didn't say invade China over this. And I didn't say invade Saudi Arabia. I think we should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1655.1s	1655.1	 talk about it. Increase the temperature. Raise the temperature. No, I did not say that either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1658.6s	1658.6	 If you want to know what I think should happen, you can ask me. Put political pressure on that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1661.8s	1661.8	 right? I think when people are involved in torture, murder, rape, and sterilizing people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1670.4s	1670.4	 that there should be economic and disengagement that occurs as a first step. And that is why when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1675.7s	1675.7	 people in our circles, in venture capital, take money from somebody who murdered a journalist,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1681.5s	1681.5	 Mohammed bin Salim, MBS from Saudi Arabia, we should disengage from a country like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1687.3s	1687.3	 I believe that that is what we should do. And I believe people like us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1690.6s	1690.6	 I believe people like us who are capital allocators and creators and who are influencers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1695.0s	1695.0	 should be talking about human rights all the time. And we should be familiar with the Universal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1700.1s	1700.1	 Declaration of Human Rights. And we should read what's in it. And we should aspire to hit those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1704.2s	1704.2	 notes in our country and everywhere else. And this me tooism, I'm sorry, this, you know, equivalency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1709.8s	1709.8	 problem that you guys keep bringing up. That is a trap. That is an intellectual trap. Because there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1715.7s	1715.7	 is no equivalency from putting a detaining a million people putting hundreds of thousands of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1721.3s	1721.3	 them and torturing them to what's happening in the United States, where we wrote the Universal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1725.3s	1725.3	 Declaration of Human Rights, and where we can have conversations about it. If you try to have the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1730.6s	1730.6	 conversation we are having here, we would all be tortured in Saudi Arabia, we would all be tortured
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1735.8s	1735.8	 and detained inside of China. I just think that there's a very dangerous thing that you're doing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1740.5s	1740.5	 which is you are ranking and which is essentially assigning some sort of let's just call it economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1746.6s	1746.6	 value to those things that you just just described torture, rape for sterilization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1753.0s	1753.0	 But I think then you're ignoring how do you actually economically rank systemic racism in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1759.2s	1759.2	 the United States? What happens in our inner school system, inner city school system? What happens to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1763.9s	1763.9	 black and brown men? What happens to the families of those people? What happens to how the lobbies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1769.4s	1769.4	 basically break down the healthcare system? All I'm saying is, Jason, if you take your argument
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1774.1s	1774.1	 to the extreme, you start to get into all these areas of gray, where it's impossible to assign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1779.8s	1779.8	 economic realities to those things so that you can actually rank and rate. That's why I do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1786.2s	1786.2	 Yeah, because we're talking about your numerically, these things, I never use a numeric.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1791.5s	1791.5	 I'm saying one is proportionally different. Sure. I'm not putting economic I never use a term
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1795.8s	1795.8	 proportion. If those really bad things happen 10 times, and these kind of bad things happen 10,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1800.9s	1800.9	 10,000 times, which one's worse? I think if you asked anybody who is in a Uyghur
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1806.2s	1806.2	 prison being sterilized, torched, and raped, if they would rather be yes, I mean, you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1810.5s	1810.5	 do this test. Jason, I'm asking you a question. If 10 people 10 Uyghurs were raped or forced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1816.1s	1816.1	 sterilized, yes versus 10 million black men falsely incarcerated, which one is worse?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1821.5s	1821.5	 Yeah, this is not the way to do the calculus. You could do it on an individual basis. You can look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1826.5s	1826.5	 at an individual inside of a prison being tortured and an individual living in the United States,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1831.4s	1831.4	 every single person who is inside of that torture chamber, being raped, being sterilized would say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1836.6s	1836.6	 I would absolutely love to come to America. That's why everybody wants to come to this country and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1840.4s	1840.4	 live in a free democracy, where they can speak freely, they can practice whatever religion they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1845.0s	1845.0	 want to not be tortured. And what you're doing by adding up all the tiny pain and suffering that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1849.4s	1849.4	 we have here in America, and then, you know, trying to conflate that with these horrific acts,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1855.7s	1855.7	 you have to look at exactly how horrific these are on an individual basis, just like we did with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1860.6s	1860.6	 George Floyd, we see George Floyd happen. That is something that is absolutely worth being outraged
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1866.1s	1866.1	 about at a higher level, right? You have to stop for a second and say, Oh, my God, this has to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1870.3s	1870.3	 resolved. We can do these two things at the same time, we can refine our education system,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1875.8s	1875.8	 George Floyd, George Floyd, actually, the Uyghurs being sterilized, I think George Floyd
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1880.3s	1880.3	 proves my point, because there's been a numeral number of black men that have been murdered with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1884.6s	1884.6	 nary a thing that's ever happened in the United States, but had happened in an exact moment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1890.2s	1890.2	 where the sum of all of these other things that happened before, had just compounded to a point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1895.5s	1895.5	 where the whole thing spilled over and enough people decided to basically say the sum total
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1899.9s	1899.9	 of this damage. Yeah. Now is the equivalent of a very meaningful human rights violation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1905.3s	1905.3	 you can work on both these things at the same time is my point. And this and this you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1909.4s	1909.4	 basically giving a pass by by kind of conflating these two things in my mind, you can work on both
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1914.7s	1914.7	 these issues, you could want to stop abhorrent torture, and murder and rape, while wanting to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1920.0s	1920.0	 make our justice system better while wanting to make our education system better. You don't have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1923.8s	1923.8	 to pick one chamoff. I think you do actually. No, you do not. We could absolutely create nothing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1930.4s	1930.4	 I can do about the Uyghurs in China. Absolutely. There is you could not capital allocate to regions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1934.8s	1934.8	 or to companies that are engaging. I don't I don't have any shing shanis. Okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1939.4s	1939.4	 perfect. And if you do see one, you could do that. And you could also speak up because they can't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1943.1s	1943.1	 get out of China. What are you talking about? Do you take money from Saudi Arabia? No, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1949.5s	1949.5	 did you make a moral decision about that? No. Okay, if you did get offered a billion dollars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1954.0s	1954.0	 would you take it from them? And by the way, to be honest, there's a bunch of my companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1957.6s	1957.6	 that have been supported by folks who have taken money from them. And I know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1961.4s	1961.4	 it's a problem when I look what? Well, what's the bigger problem? Is it that the solution that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1965.8s	1965.8	 these guys are that they're designing for mental health or diabetes or, you know, housing or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1971.4s	1971.4	 whatever it is this startup does when they take money from SoftBank or whoever, all of a sudden,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1975.4s	1975.4	 they should be canceled and not be able to do that. I didn't say cancel just take the money from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1978.3s	1978.3	 somebody different. Nobody said canceled. Where? I don't know, Co to pick another firm Goldman,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1983.9s	1983.9	 I don't know who doesn't take Saudi should the United States create a program where whenever you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1987.8s	1987.8	 get a way you ever get a term sheet from SoftBank or anybody with money from didn't say that if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1992.6s	1992.6	 should just be able to go and redeem it for some somebody else's money. I never said that either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=1996.2s	1996.2	 I think each individual, a capital allocated like yourself and a CEO should make what they believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2001.1s	2001.1	 is a morally right decision. Well, they voted and they don't care about this issue. They're voting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2006.2s	2006.2	 with their dollars every day that people should care about human rights and they should care about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2009.4s	2009.4	 who they make money for. I know I'm a lone voice. I know I'm a lone voice. But I believe you should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2014.2s	2014.2	 care about. I'm not saying Jason, I'm just saying something very subtle. I'm not saying that what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2019.4s	2019.4	 you believe is wrong. In fact, I think it's beautiful and wholeheartedly right. What I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2023.7s	2023.7	 saying is when everybody else tries to nod their head and agree with you in the moment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2027.6s	2027.6	 they're just moral leave virtue signaling in a luxury belief that they themselves don't exhibit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2033.3s	2033.3	 they don't make any changes towards and it's largely because they don't believe that this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2037.2s	2037.2	 is an issue and I'm just putting it on the table as it just is true based on everybody's behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2042.2s	2042.2	 maybe other than you. I agree with you. But everybody else is voting. I would like to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2046.6s	2046.6	 change everybody's behavior. And I think you can offer your opinion and maybe you will change some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2049.8s	2049.8	 people's minds. I'm sure there are some people listening here and I know there are some founders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2053.0s	2053.0	 who would not take money from SoftBank and would not take money from Saudi Arabia. And I know there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2056.6s	2056.6	 are some capital allocators who will not take money from dictatorships. I think that you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2061.0s	2061.0	 also forgetting that there's there has been as it seems again, from very, very far away looking in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2068.4s	2068.4	 a lot of things that they have been able to do that is really constructive, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2071.8s	2071.8	 they've actually created some pretty decent ties to Israel. They've actually started to create a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2078.2s	2078.2	 path to normalize relations in the Middle East. You know, they've organized against what could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2083.4s	2083.4	 be the real threat there, which is, you know, a nuclear empowered Iran. So just to put things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2089.9s	2089.9	 in perspective, Jason, it's kind of like you have to look at the totality of the situation again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2094.2s	2094.2	 in the United States today, if you just looked at that one simple thing, you can cherry pick all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2098.6s	2098.6	 kinds of reasons why many other companies shouldn't expect shouldn't accept American
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2103.1s	2103.1	 capital. Because you know, we don't really exactly have our shit together either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2106.3s	2106.3	 Proportion of these issues is the I think I think what what your mouth is saying is the world the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2110.1s	2110.1	 world is complicated. I mean, we had so under the previous president, they said there could never be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2115.6s	2115.6	 like a peace in the Middle East or a deal between Israel and Arab powers. And there was the Doha
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2121.8s	2121.8	 agreement where you had three Arab states signing peace treaties with Israel, and Saudi Arabia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2127.0s	2127.0	 allowing flights between Saudi Arabia and Israel for the first time. And that's all because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2131.9s	2131.9	 of MBS. And there was an article in the Wall Street Journal talking about how King Salman actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2137.4s	2137.4	 was holding MBS back on this because, you know, he's part of the previous generation, who is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2143.2s	2143.2	 backing the Palestinians, and MBS just wants to move forward and actually get a deal done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2148.2s	2148.2	 with Israel. And if the Palestinians won't make it, then he's willing to move forward without them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2152.2s	2152.2	 And this is not me saying this is the Wall Street Journal. Yeah, we need to dig up that piece. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2156.3s	2156.3	 all I'm saying, look, what happened with that journalist was absolutely wrong. But clearly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2161.5s	2161.5	 like, foreign relations is very complicated, especially in the Middle East. And it's not

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2172.5s	2172.5	 country engages in extra judicial killings, they just got caught. Right? Because I don't think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2177.4s	2177.4	 it's fair to say that also torch, they also killed a journalist, I think that Americans have done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2181.7s	2181.7	 that. Okay, we've done that as well as well. Absolutely. I don't think you actually have any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2186.8s	2186.8	 idea the extent of what we have done during the course of these wars in all of these countries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2191.5s	2191.5	 I don't think you know. Well, I don't think I know. So by saying, and I think you're basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2196.5s	2196.5	 nobody knows if we chopped up a journalist who criticized the president. Who is an Al Grabe,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2201.5s	2201.5	 Abu Grabe? Do you really know? Do you know of all the other the worst, one of the worst things we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2205.8s	2205.8	 ever did. And one of the things we need to aspire to do better to it. We've gone blunder around the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2210.7s	2210.7	 Middle East for 20 years now in Afghanistan. We supported warlords in Afghanistan who we were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2216.5s	2216.5	 allies with, who were raping young boys. I mean, this was like a giant series of articles in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2222.0s	2222.0	 New York Times, all of Iran contra. I mean, we've been doing this since the 80s. More recently,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2227.4s	2227.4	 in Libya, we basically got rid of a good offie and plunged that whole country into civil war,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2232.6s	2232.6	 and it's never recovered from it. So look, I actually, Jason, I'm somewhere in between,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2236.8s	2236.8	 I actually agree with your idealism. My mind's still blown that you actually work for MC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2241.4s	2241.4	 International. But I just think that the world is more complicated than that. And sometimes we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2245.6s	2245.6	 to make choices. And the thing that concerns me is that that idealism that you're citing has become
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2252.9s	2252.9	 a prelude and a pretext for war in the over the last 20 years. And we can't be clear, I'm not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2258.9s	2258.9	 advocating we go around the globe getting into these conflicts, Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2265.6s	2265.6	 what good has that done us? Yeah, you know, I'm anti war, you know, I'm anti war. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2269.8s	2269.8	 I'm not advocating for invading places. I'm advocating that we speak up when we see Saudi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2275.6s	2275.6	 Arabia take a blogger, Rafi Badawai. Everybody did. I mean, that was universally condemned. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2282.2s	2282.2	 the question is, at the end of the day, for writing blog posts, what's the alternative in Saudi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2287.8s	2287.8	 Arabia? Who's our alternative there? We don't get to pick and choose who the leaders of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2293.0s	2293.0	 countries are. Does it mean that doesn't I'm talking specifically about entrepreneurs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2296.6s	2296.6	 capital allocators, that doesn't mean we need to engage in business and building their chip stack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2300.6s	2300.6	 If you want the sternly worded press release, you just got it from Biden to hopefully it's

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2310.2s	2310.2	 us talking about actually, if you want to know what I want, I want to see the three of you speak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2313.2s	2313.2	 up for human rights. That's what I would like to say. I think that human rights in the United
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2317.8s	2317.8	 States is way more important to me than human rights anywhere else in the globe. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2322.0s	2322.0	 that we have an abysmal track record of taking care of colored men and women in this country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2328.5s	2328.5	 And I don't disagree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2329.8s	2329.8	 And so I have zero patience and tolerance for white men blathering on about shit that happens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2335.4s	2335.4	 outside your own backyard. Fix your own inside backyard, because you guys are the ones that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2342.2s	2342.2	 are getting to diminish me for being white. No, I understand. But I'm saying that you are uniquely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2345.6s	2345.6	 in a position of power in a way that the rest of us are not. And so when you guys clean up the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2350.5s	2350.5	 inside, then we can go and fix the outside. Yeah, I believe we can do both. I believe we can do the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2356.5s	2356.5	 same thing. At the same time, we can speak about human rights here. We can speak about in Saudi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2361.8s	2361.8	 Arabia, we can speak about in China. And we can talk about the same thing. We can talk about all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2366.1s	2366.1	 the human rights issues from freedom to murder. I do I do constantly. If you care so much about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2371.8s	2371.8	 journalists, why haven't you spoken up in favor of Sonja Assange the way that Glenn Greenwald has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2375.6s	2375.6	 of Julian Assange Assange and Snowden read Glenn Greenwald's reporting on these topics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2379.8s	2379.8	 that we need to get to the bottom of both of those. In either case, we don't know the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2383.8s	2383.8	 bottom of it. You've acted with complete certainty on Twitter saying that these guys are traitors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2388.1s	2388.1	 and should be locked up in US prisons. No, no, I think we don't know. I don't think we know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2393.5s	2393.5	 who they're working for. Why haven't you spent the time to learn? No, well, I mean, it is a black box
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2398.3s	2398.3	 in that case. We don't know. In both of those cases, what the backstory is, I do think I do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2403.0s	2403.0	 have a new one. You know about what's going on with the Uyghurs because you read a New York Times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2407.6s	2407.6	 article. It's it's it's a New York Times article about Snowden. We have had people who have we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2414.2s	2414.2	 we have people who have defected and been on 60 minutes who were in those prisons. You believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2419.9s	2419.9	 what you want to believe? No, you literally can believe somebody who escaped from the prison.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2425.0s	2425.0	 You can believe them. Yes. With it when it comes to Julian Assange, I don't know what to believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2430.3s	2430.3	 exactly because he released all those data dumps. And he didn't do it properly like a journalist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2435.4s	2435.4	 where he vetted the information with Snowden. I'm more inclined to think that he was a good actor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2439.9s	2439.9	 And I think it's a very nuanced position. So if you want to try to paint me as like not knowing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2445.2s	2445.2	 everything about every human rights violation in the world, every nuanced position of a leaker,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2450.5s	2450.5	 that's correct. I don't know everything about everybody. But I'm going to take that position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2453.7s	2453.7	 I don't know anything about any of these things, which is why I chose to focus on the things that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2457.4s	2457.4	 I can control. And I want to believe that I want to improve my own backyard, which I think is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2462.9s	2462.9	 absolutely great. And I think you can add an end there, which is you should be talking about human
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2467.4s	2467.4	 rights in Hong Kong should be talking about it. And should be talking about it. Okay, not my problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2472.6s	2472.6	 is the problem. Not my problem. I believe that's part of the problem right now. You said it. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2477.8s	2477.8	 said it perfectly, Jamath. People don't care about human rights anymore. There's a larger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2481.4s	2481.4	 people I agree with you who do not care about human rights the way I think they care about the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2485.8s	2485.8	 local version of human rights. Fine. Yeah. And I think you need to care about all of them and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2490.9s	2490.9	 talk about all of them at the same time. International Adventurism around human rights,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2494.5s	2494.5	 I don't support in the least. And I do feel that a lot of this stuff is like the tip of the spear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2499.4s	2499.4	 of people who then get morally absolute and say we have to fix this. And the only solution is to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2505.0s	2505.0	 invade these countries. And instead, I would just rather them if they really care about it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2509.4s	2509.4	 let them stand up and do what they need to do. I think we need to fix our own backyard. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2513.5s	2513.5	 look, not to kind of bolster Jamath's point, but there is a blind eye turned to that which we don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2520.6s	2520.6	 want to believe or that narrative which we don't want to sell. And then we point towards the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2524.7s	2524.7	 narrative that we do. And we see this all the time where the focal point of where should we be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2529.8s	2529.8	 addressing human rights issues is where we have economic and geopolitical interest. No one seems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2534.7s	2534.7	 to be solving the problem in Somalia. No one's getting on stage talking about the issues that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2539.1s	2539.1	 people are facing in countries outside of where we have deep rooted trade partnerships and serious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2545.3s	2545.3	 economic interest. And so, you know, like we can tell ourselves all day long that we need to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2550.5s	2550.5	 absolutists and absolutely take care of the world because we're the beacon for human rights. But the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2556.9s	2556.9	 challenge is we end up being forced to choose where we want to spend our time and our resources.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2561.4s	2561.4	 And our resources go to where those resources flow back to us. And that's often where we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2566.2s	2566.2	 a geopolitical and economic interest. Now, Jason, I'll say one more thing. Like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2570.3s	2570.3	 just because it's important, Jay, Kyle, because you called us all out. I am an absolute human
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2577.0s	2577.0	 rightist in the sense that I believe every human on earth should have a right to do whatever they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2581.9s	2581.9	 want within their own sphere of influence, provided their sphere of influence does not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2585.4s	2585.4	 intersect with the sphere of influence of others. End of story. And I don't see that happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2590.3s	2590.3	 anywhere on earth. And this ends up being a trade off. You always end up trading off your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2595.1s	2595.1	 sphere of influence for that of the greater good or someone else because power allocates and power
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2601.0s	2601.0	 aggregates to specific places, often to government, sometimes to organize societal decisions that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2606.2s	2606.2	 say we're going to trade off our individual rights and freedoms for that of the greater collective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2610.6s	2610.6	 And it is that judgment and it is that gray area where all of these issues that we individually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2615.3s	2615.3	 choose to address and spend our time on arise. And so I have, you know, just to point out like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2621.3s	2621.3	 a very absolute point of view on this. But to me, the challenge is how do you make a discernment?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2626.3s	2626.3	 How do you make a determination that imprisonment of brown and black people in the United States
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2632.2s	2632.2	 versus the treatment of people by militia in Somalia versus the treatment of the Uyghurs in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2640.5s	2640.5	 China versus, you know, and you go on and on and on. It's a very difficult moral judgment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2645.8s	2645.8	 Or you could just say they're all wrong. They are all wrong. They are all wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2649.6s	2649.6	 But I don't care about the other time we're going to talk about see, but you work on all of them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2653.6s	2653.6	 you work on none of them. And I would rather see innovation enable more people to have access
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2658.8s	2658.8	 to more free speech, to have more resources, to have more of an ability to climb and have the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2664.1s	2664.1	 freedom to do the things they want to do with their life. I think that innovation and technology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2668.4s	2668.4	 can bring all of these old school ways of thinking and behaving out of the medieval ages and the dark
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2673.8s	2673.8	 ages. And so that's where I choose to spend my time. You know, how can we unleash people's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2678.4s	2678.4	 freedom? We got to make things more available. We got to make things more accessible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2682.2s	2682.2	 I just want to make two points and then maybe we can move on on this topic. Point number one is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2686.0s	2686.0	 when you're an immigrant, part of what you're doing is you're actually voting against the place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2691.0s	2691.0	 that you leave to embrace the place that you come to. And Jason, you know, of all the four of us on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2696.6s	2696.6	 this pod, you're the only natural born American, right? You started here, you've lived your entire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2702.0s	2702.0	 life here. And that's an incredible blessing that you were given. And the three of us weren't. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2709.9s	2709.9	 you know, in my case, I had to go through an even more circuitous path. I didn't even come to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2714.6s	2714.6	 United States first, I had to go through Canada. But implicitly, you know, when I look at the places
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2719.3s	2719.3	 that I left, and specifically, you know, when I look at Sri Lanka, who, you know, has a very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2724.0s	2724.0	 checkered human rights record, in fact, terrible in some ways, and the way that they ended the war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2728.6s	2728.6	 against the Tamils atrocious, I have to make a decision, right? I have to make a decision about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2735.1s	2735.1	 is this something that I'm going to wade into or not. And what I realized through my own life's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2739.6s	2739.6	 journey is these are not my battles. And in many ways, I abdicated my responsibility to vote on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2745.4s	2745.4	 that issue when I left. And instead, I stay here and I focus on the things that I can control here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2751.5s	2751.5	 And I think that I do have a responsibility to fix the issues of the country that adopted me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2757.8s	2757.8	 And so that's where some of my framework comes from. Separately, I do want to give all three of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2762.8s	2762.8	 us a shout out because I do think that there is an enormous human rights issue that I do think we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2768.2s	2768.2	 did bring up and in the last few weeks has become a real groundswell. And it started on the,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2774.1s	2774.1	 you know, year and recap pod where we talked about what's happened to our kids.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2778.0s	2778.0	 And I just want to call out that in the last few weeks, the amount of press attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2782.5s	2782.5	 that this issue has gotten, which I do think is a human rights level issue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2787.0s	2787.0	 which is a cognitive impairment of our children has really come front and center.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2791.4s	2791.4	 And I think that it's really, really incredible all the way to like even nature now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2796.5s	2796.5	 publishing these, you know, and maybe the timing is just coincidental. But these big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2800.9s	2800.9	 longitudinal studies that really show that, you know, we have driven a level of retardation in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2808.1s	2808.1	 our children, we have held them back from a level of learning and development that we now have thrown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2814.9s	2814.9	 our arms up in the air, we don't know what the real long term impact is. That I think is a human
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2819.6s	2819.6	 rights level issue. And domestically in the United States, I think we're in a position to fix it if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2823.9s	2823.9	 we decide to take care of it. So, you know, again, I don't mean to offend you when I say that in my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2828.5s	2828.5	 prioritization list, it's below the line. But there are different human rights issues that I care about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2832.8s	2832.8	 And I think to just to be clear, you know, when you said I called everybody out here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2836.9s	2836.9	 I'm trying to have a productive discussion. Freeberg, I'm not trying to put him in a spot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2840.3s	2840.3	 I don't get offended. I'm not. I'm trying to have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2842.7s	2842.7	 productive discourse. I don't get offended at anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2845.7s	2845.7	 But I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to call out besties here. I'm trying to have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2848.6s	2848.6	 productive dialogue. Prince Aloe, he's like one of the largest investors in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2854.0s	2854.0	 You know, I wouldn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2856.6s	2856.6	 Yeah, he's a he's a Saudi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2857.8s	2857.8	 So if they're just a citizen of Saudi Arabia, you wouldn't take money from them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2860.9s	2860.9	 If the money comes from a dictatorship, from authoritarian country, I would 100%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2865.2s	2865.2	 He was locked up. He was locked up at the Ritz and he was forced to give a bunch of his money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2869.2s	2869.2	 And so it wasn't clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2870.1s	2870.1	 Mostly live out of the country anyway. I mean, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2872.5s	2872.5	 again, if his money, if you're asking me, let's put it inside of a specific person,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2877.6s	2877.6	 I'll just tell you my my philosophy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2878.9s	2878.9	 He's a citizen or a former citizen of that country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2881.3s	2881.3	 He was born there, J. Cal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2882.7s	2882.7	 Yeah, I agree. Let me just tell you, I clearly I would never take money from an authoritarian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2888.9s	2888.9	 regime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2889.4s	2889.4	 Would you take money from a Chinese billionaire?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2891.8s	2891.8	 No, I would not take it from a Chinese. No, I would not take it from a Chinese.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2895.4s	2895.4	 If I if I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2896.2s	2896.2	 No, not an authoritarian regime. They they Chinese are not authoritarian.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2899.8s	2899.8	 No, we're talking about a Chinese billionaire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2902.0s	2902.0	 If the Chinese billionaire was outspoken about human, I would tell you it's a great thought
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2906.0s	2906.0	 question. And I'm just ripping here. It's a great thought experiment. If a Chinese billionaire had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2910.9s	2910.9	 left China and was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2913.9s	2913.9	 Would you take Chamath's money?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2915.4s	2915.4	 Because Chamath has violated your human rights at the poker table many times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2918.5s	2918.5	 That's true. He has turned over to seven going all in. When I have two pair and I'm like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2924.2s	2924.2	 I guess he's got a set. And he just absolutely tortures me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2928.6s	2928.6	 So but no, I would not I would if the person was a reformer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2932.5s	2932.5	 Yes, I would consider it. I would consider it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2935.2s	2935.2	 Jason, but Jason, I guess what you're saying is like you and this is your decision to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2939.4s	2939.4	 My decision. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2940.2s	2940.2	 It's it's important for you that you understand what people's personal belief systems are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2946.4s	2946.4	 When you take money from them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2948.2s	2948.2	 No, human rights is important to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2950.4s	2950.4	 But there's some saying like their personal belief system like you know, you you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2953.5s	2953.5	 know, it's more specific if they were an illicit drug user, right for somebody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2957.8s	2957.8	 So for example, I'll give you an example. So I did take money from a Chinese billionaire when I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2961.8s	2961.8	 when I first started. I'm not going to say who it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2964.2s	2964.2	 No, no need.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2965.3s	2965.3	 But there was a morality clause. And there were certain things that were incredibly important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2971.0s	2971.0	 to this person. And they were very easy for me to reflect because they were nothing that I cared
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2975.2s	2975.2	 about. But you know, they explicitly didn't want certain kinds of investments in gambling,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2981.0s	2981.0	 cannabis, sex, porn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2983.5s	2983.5	 For me, yeah, this was gambling, alcohol, can anyone My point is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2988.9s	2988.9	 you're fine signing up to those moral judgments from an investor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2993.6s	2993.6	 Am I?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2993.9s	2993.9	 But not necessarily, you know, silence on I'm asking you the question, you would be fine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=2998.1s	2998.1	 signing up for those moral obligations for moral delineation of what you can and can't do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3002.1s	3002.1	 even if it's not against what you believe. But you have a different issue when it comes to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3005.9s	3005.9	 silence on these other topics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3007.3s	3007.3	 Yeah, I would. Here's here's how I'll answer the question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3010.2s	3010.2	 I if I'm taking other people's money to invest it, and they don't want to invest in the adult,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3014.4s	3014.4	 I don't have a problem with cannabis as an example, I don't have a problem with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3018.3s	3018.3	 wagering and gambling. But if I'm building a fund to invest in businesses, those are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3024.0s	3024.0	 that's not an important issue for me. And I don't know, that's a great venture investment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3027.2s	3027.2	 And I can also invest outside of it my own money. So it's a more nuanced issue there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3031.4s	3031.4	 like I have invested in wagering apps, and I'm thinking about creating a syndicate specifically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3036.1s	3036.1	 for gambling and wagering. And yes, there are LPs who I currently have in my previous fund,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3040.9s	3040.9	 the active fund that do not I do not invest in wagering because of that. So yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3045.4s	3045.4	 And it's because they just want clarity in some cases on not getting sued for investing in a in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3051.7s	3051.7	 wagering companies where we don't have a federal mandate yet. So, you know, I think comparing it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3056.7s	3056.7	 these are great thought experiments. I was fine signing up everything for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3061.4s	3061.4	 I was fine signing up for no alcohol because my father was an alcoholic. And so it was it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3066.1s	3066.1	 more aligned. And there was a certain investor who at one point tried to be an LP very well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3075.1s	3075.1	 known person who was convicted of domestic abuse. And I didn't take that money because I was I had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3083.4s	3083.4	 been the victim of domestic abuse as my as my as my mom. Yeah. And so that was a moral issue for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3089.7s	3089.7	 The point I'm trying to make to Jason is that it's very nuanced. Everybody can be on a bunch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3093.3s	3093.3	 of different sides of this thing. And I tend to think the most consistent reliable thing is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3098.0s	3098.0	 these are very local beliefs that when they touch you, you have a point of view on them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3103.1s	3103.1	 And I think that, you know, it's much more practical, and maybe this is just being too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3108.9s	3108.9	 practical to see a world where people want to fix their own backyard first. And the and I think a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3117.8s	3117.8	 lot of why you may be disappointed that a lot of people don't have a stronger view on things like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3122.3s	3122.3	 China is people are a little exhausted with having moral views about things that are so far away,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3128.3s	3128.3	 when things in their own backyard are so broken. Yeah. And I can understand that exhaustion and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3133.0s	3133.0	 to be clear, I just feel like human rights is such an obvious and easy one to get behind for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3138.0s	3138.0	 all humans. And that really was what and that's what the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3143.2s	3143.2	 was about was we were hoping that all countries in the United Nations or Eleanor Roosevelt was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3147.4s	3147.4	 that we could all just agree that torture was immoral. And when the United States water board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3152.6s	3152.6	 of people and the United States can't even agree whether the death penalty is immoral. So right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3156.6s	3156.6	 And you know, that's something that you know, is our great failing riddled with hypocrisy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3161.2s	3161.2	 the Declaration of Human Rights here is is an ideal. It's a goal. It's something to strive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3165.8s	3165.8	 towards. And each country has places where they succeed and fail. And you can actually measure it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3171.4s	3171.4	 And we do measure it. Actually, we do measure which countries have the worst record on human
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3175.6s	3175.6	 rights violations, and which ones have the best. I think these quantifiable scores are crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3180.3s	3180.3	 No, no, they're not. You can literally talk look at how many women are raped in prison in one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3183.9s	3183.9	 country versus another. My point is, when you put a score to that or count it, you're not counting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3189.0s	3189.0	 a bunch of other things that are really bad as well. The scoring system could be refined. Sure,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3193.3s	3193.3	 I will give you that. And I think this is the debate we had today, which was an unexpected
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3198.4s	3198.4	 debate. And I didn't think we would go this deeper, I think is such an important debate for us to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3203.0s	3203.0	 as humans and as a civilization, because we are getting in the weeds on so many other issues,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3207.4s	3207.4	 whether it's inflation, or, you know, innovation or politics, that human rights, I feel is something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3214.6s	3214.6	 we should all be able to agree on that all people should be able to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3219.2s	3219.2	 J Cal, everyone says yes, the definition and the prioritization is where all the noises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3225.8s	3225.8	 Yeah, that's that's everything. And how do we deal with violence? No one on earth that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3229.2s	3229.2	 gonna say I don't believe in human rights. Well, no, we all agree with the ideals. Everyone agrees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3235.4s	3235.4	 with the ideals. The question is how you implement them. Implementation, prioritization,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3240.2s	3240.2	 definitions. For example, I think it's a legitimate position for you to say that you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3244.7s	3244.7	 not going to take money from dictators, but to then say that any family office from any individual
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3251.4s	3251.4	 who was born in that country, you're not going to take their money either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3255.1s	3255.1	 I would have to think about it. I didn't say that. Unless they're willing to risk their lives by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3259.5s	3259.5	 denouncing their own government. I don't know that they have to do it. I don't know they have to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3263.2s	3263.2	 it publicly. I mean, if I talk to this hypothetical Chinese or Saudi person, and they said, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3268.4s	3268.4	 agree with this, I'm working against, I'm a reformer, I guess I would have to consider it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3272.2s	3272.2	 because you would want to make money for the reformer. But Jason, what if they said, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3276.2s	3276.2	 have a point of view, then I would go with people who would you morally disqualify them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3281.8s	3281.8	 You disqualify them on moral ground. That's not the way to make allies, J. Cal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3286.1s	3286.1	 which is important. You're not. So look, look, hold on, I need to answer it. If you're both
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3290.2s	3290.2	 going to ask me this question and accuse me of you know, this, I would have to make a nuanced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3295.1s	3295.1	 decision on an individual basis. I would not make a blanket decision. That's my position on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3300.0s	3300.0	 hypothetical situation, where somebody is a Saudi citizen has a family office, I would have to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3304.4s	3304.4	 a very nuanced decision like you did Chamath, where you didn't take the domestic abusers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3308.5s	3308.5	 And you did take the person that was an American, but I took the Chinese. Okay, yeah, but it's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3311.9s	3311.9	 same thing. It's a human rights violation. It's a horrible thing that occurred, and you had to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3315.4s	3315.4	 a nuanced decision. And, you know, that's what I'm hoping to promote here, is that we have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3321.0s	3321.0	 dialogue about human rights again, because when I was growing up in the 80s, this was something that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3325.6s	3325.6	 the world was getting consensus on, and the West had consensus on and I think the West is very weak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3331.1s	3331.1	 now. And the fact that the NBA, that, you know, Apple, whatever companies, I don't want to call
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3338.0s	3338.0	 out individuals, because it's not productive, especially if it gets re aggregated. And, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3343.0s	3343.0	 know, I happen to know some of them. It's, it's something that the West has to contend with of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3348.6s	3348.6	 what is our strategy here with human rights violators? Do we engage them? Do we admonish them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3354.5s	3354.5	 or somewhere in between? Do we disengage, engage, or, you know, make our feelings heard and try to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3359.8s	3359.8	 shape their behavior to bend towards human rights? It's a very complicated, nuanced discussion. I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3365.3s	3365.3	 glad we had it here today. The time period you're talking about where we supposedly had consensus on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3369.1s	3369.1	 this during the, you said the 1980s during the Cold War. I was talking about in America. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3373.4s	3373.4	 Okay, well. We talked about it a lot in America is my point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3377.5s	3377.5	 Yeah. Well, I think, actually, I think Ronald Reagan did an earlier job with this. He denounced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3382.6s	3382.6	 the evil empire, but said that we should be a shining city on a hill. And we did actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3387.4s	3387.4	 avoided a bunch of unnecessary foreign wars. 100%. So, look, I think the best way for us to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3395.4s	3395.4	 lead on this issue is just to be an example. We're not doing a very good job of that. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3398.9s	3398.9	 100% of your ideals are great, but the world doesn't neatly line up with those ideals and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3402.9s	3402.9	 presents us with choices that don't fit those ideals. I mean, during the Cold War, we had a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3407.3s	3407.3	 choice to support either communist regimes, or in a lot of cases, authoritarian regimes. And we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3412.7s	3412.7	 chose the lesser of two evils. I think today, we have choices between do we want to support Islamic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3417.9s	3417.9	 fundamentalist regimes, or we want to support authoritarian regimes who are resisting it. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3422.1s	3422.1	 mean, those are the types of tough choices the world actually presents to us. And I think that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3426.7s	3426.7	 what makes it hard to sort of to stick to these ideals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3431.3s	3431.3	 My enemy's enemy is my friend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3432.3s	3432.3	 It's a complicated chessboard. And you're better at chess than me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3435.1s	3435.1	 Zach. So I will give you that. And I think it's great that we had this discussion. I really do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3438.5s	3438.5	 appreciate that you guys were willing to talk about this for so long. It's an important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3442.3s	3442.3	 discussion. Because if we don't stand for human rights and basic human rights, what do we stand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3446.2s	3446.2	 for? You know, and I agree that domestic is important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3449.1s	3449.1	 I stand for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3451.4s	3451.4	 Yeah, we know that. We know that. Tell us about the sweater. Tell us about the sweater. No
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3455.7s	3455.7	 candle. This is you know, if you're concerned about the rise of authoritarianism, which actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3459.8s	3459.8	 this was my one of my big trends in the prediction episodes. I am concerned democracy is the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3465.3s	3465.3	 negative trend. But then I think you should be concerned about this like rising tide we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3469.4s	3469.4	 here of censorship, and the surveillance state. Yes, I'm in agreement and our federal law
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3474.5s	3474.5	 enforcement agencies demanding more and more power lockdowns and lockdowns. I'm in agreement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3480.0s	3480.0	 blowing this whole like January 16 out of proportion, you should be concerned about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3485.0s	3485.0	 their attempts to exploit and use that to demand more powers to surveil and prosecute American
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3490.7s	3490.7	 citizens. I do not believe in surveillance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3493.7s	3493.7	 You should understand that the hysteria created around that event is going to be used,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3498.4s	3498.4	 it's going to be exploited. Possibly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3499.9s	3499.9	 To demand these powers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3501.4s	3501.4	 Politicians are exploiting this on all sides of the aisle. I agree with you. The right and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3504.9s	3504.9	 left. The right is diminishing it. The left is exacerbating it. The truth in the middle is I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3509.8s	3509.8	 think we are in agreement, Sax. The overwhelming majority of people who went to the Capitol that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3513.8s	3513.8	 day were dipshits who just wanted to protest and they cared about Trump and they went there for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3518.9s	3518.9	 party of it all. And then there was a small cohort who intended harm and who are deranged and who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3524.4s	3524.4	 could potentially be dangerous in the way Chamath framed it lone wolves or small packs of wolves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3529.0s	3529.0	 like the Oklahoma City bombers who murdered a large number of people. And so we have to be very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3534.1s	3534.1	 careful in prosecuting one group one way and one the other way. And that's exactly what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3538.7s	3538.7	 Department of Justice has done in that case 700 people got pled deals or very minor sentences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3545.0s	3545.0	 And then these folks are going to have the book thrown at them and rightfully so because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3549.0s	3549.0	 they could have murdered Pence or they could have murdered Pelosi just like that woman got murdered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3553.6s	3553.6	 I'm sorry, the woman tragically got stopped and shot and died. Like that could have been a much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3558.9s	3558.9	 different day if dozens of people had died. And those cops had not shown restraint, we could be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3563.3s	3563.3	 sitting here having a much different discussion about the oath keepers. If the oath keepers had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3567.2s	3567.2	 done what the Oklahoma City bombers succeeded in doing, this would be a much different discussion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3571.9s	3571.9	 Right, they didn't, which is why it is a different discussion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3574.6s	3574.6	 Well, thank God for our police and, and for how brave they were in not unloading their pistols
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3580.3s	3580.3	 when any reasonable person who was being beaten by that crowd and crushed would have taken their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3586.0s	3586.0	 gun out and started firing. They didn't thank God those police did not look, I think the one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3590.3s	3590.3	 thing we can agree on is we don't want something like that to happen again. And there's two things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3593.8s	3593.8	 two simple things that would prevent it. One is reform of the electoral count act like we talked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3597.8s	3597.8	 about. That's what Biden should be going for, not making these speeches about Bull Connor and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3602.7s	3602.7	 George Wallace, he could actually get that done. And the other thing is if the Capitol police
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3606.8s	3606.8	 had just been a little bit more prepared and had barricades and screens of better security,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3610.2s	3610.2	 that also couldn't have, it couldn't happen again. That's all we have to do to solve that problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3614.2s	3614.2	 Oh no, the third thing we have to do is arrest these oath keepers and put them in jail for what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3617.8s	3617.8	 they did. That's happened. Well, it's no, they've been indicted. You tell me if they're going to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3623.0s	3623.0	 to jail, they'll convict them of something. Yeah. Well, and rightfully so it seems. Hopefully they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3627.6s	3627.6	 get their day in court. Maybe we can transition. I want to talk about the other side of the coin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3633.0s	3633.0	 on inflation, because I think that we have hammered the point for a long time now that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3639.8s	3639.8	 you know, the government was really sort of like off piste by printing and competent trillions and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3646.1s	3646.1	 trillions of dollars and injecting it into the economy. And what it's really created has been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3651.9s	3651.9	 this massive bout of inflation, which then could cause an ultimate recession because the Fed has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3656.6s	3656.6	 to react. All of those things I think are well documented. I just wanted to put on the record
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3661.4s	3661.4	 the little element of the counterfactual, which I think is really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3666.5s	3666.5	 And this is an article in the Wall Street Journal and Nick, you can post this if you can please, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3670.5s	3670.5	 I'm just going to read this. I'm just going to look down. The first two rounds of stimulus payments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3674.3s	3674.3	 lifted 11.7 million people in America out of poverty. According to the Census Bureau,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3680.9s	3680.9	 Americans build up $2.7 trillion in extra savings. And some expect that combined with rising wages
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3687.1s	3687.1	 to provide them with lasting stability, despite the return to more normal spending patterns and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3693.1s	3693.1	 rising inflation. So I just want to make sure that all of us have heard that because that's an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3698.5s	3698.5	 incredible thing to be able to say that 11.7 million Americans in poverty are no longer in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3702.9s	3702.9	 poverty because of the stimulus, which I think when you look at the right way of framing what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3708.2s	3708.2	 some of these progressives want to do, I think a lot of the good intentions comes from things like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3713.3s	3713.3	 this. And I just think it's important to acknowledge that that did happen. And that's something that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3717.5s	3717.5	 should really be proud of. And especially if those folks can actually stay in the lower middle and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3722.7s	3722.7	 then move up to the middle class. That's an incredible outcome. And we all supported that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3729.1s	3729.1	 I think genuinely. And I think that that's good. We knew it was scary and we needed to put something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3733.1s	3733.1	 into the economy to keep it from crashing. And it's very hard to know what the right amount was,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3737.8s	3737.8	 right? How do you know what the right amount of stimulus is in a pandemic that happens every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3742.6s	3742.6	 hundred years? And thank God it feels like Omicron is, you know, leading us out of this. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3748.1s	3748.1	 Yeah, there's some great examples, by the way, in this article, if you guys, if people want to take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3751.8s	3751.8	 the time to read it of some examples of people that have really done an incredible job in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3758.0s	3758.0	 in like completely changing their financial picture, which I mean, a lot of, a lot of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3762.1s	3762.1	 went into freelance, a lot of these young people realize, I don't know if you saw this headline,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3765.9s	3765.9	 a million less people started college this year and enrolled. And I think what's happening is so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3770.7s	3770.7	 many people who were going into college realize, I don't know if I should go into debt. I figured
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3774.4s	3774.4	 out a way to make money at home. I'm more financially literate. I'm going to make a better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3778.1s	3778.1	 decision about college and not go 100K into debt. Well, to be very specific, very resilient. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3782.8s	3782.8	 they're being better making better judgments about their own lives because they've been forced to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3786.8s	3786.8	 to be specific. I think you mean boys, because the other thing that's happening is in colleges. Now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3792.6s	3792.6	 it's becoming very tilted female versus male, especially in some colleges, in some colleges,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3797.8s	3797.8	 it's, you know, two thirds female, one male. So we were actually creating this weird launch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3803.0s	3803.0	 toodle pattern here where an entire gender is going to be very miseducated relative to another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3810.6s	3810.6	 one. And in fact, it'll be the exact opposite of what it was like in probably the fifties or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3815.1s	3815.1	 sixties where you had these large swaths of men that are educated women who typically stayed home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3819.4s	3819.4	 or were under educated relative to their ability. Here now it's the exact opposite where, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3824.6s	3824.6	 women are getting undergrads and graduate degrees and boys are learning how to play video games and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3829.7s	3829.7	 smoke pot incels a very strange time. I mean, that's what happens when you David's, what is that like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3835.0s	3835.0	 being an incel, tell us you were a pioneer in being an incel. We made it through the show. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3840.2s	3840.2	 it was so civil. Let's get the Friedberg ratio up. Let's talk about an exciting scientific paper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3845.9s	3845.9	 and the implications of it. Tell us about this new study from Harvard that revealed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3851.8s	3851.8	 Epstein-Barr virus could be associated with MS. I'll do a zoom out then a zoom in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3855.7s	3855.7	 Yes, bear with me for a moment. So, you know, there are over 80 what are called autoimmune diseases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3862.9s	3862.9	 These are diseases where your body, your immune system attacks your own tissue and causes real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3867.9s	3867.9	 problems. One in 20 people worldwide suffer from some sort of autoimmune condition. So disease,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3874.5s	3874.5	 lupus, which affects, you know, your whole system, rheumatoid arthritis, where your joints get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3880.1s	3880.1	 inflamed, Sjogren syndrome, where your eyes and your mouth get messed up and multiple sclerosis,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3885.5s	3885.5	 which we'll talk about here in a second. But these are all diseases that have a similar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3889.0s	3889.0	 ideology, which is that your immune system attacks some tissue in your body, it dysfunctions and it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3894.4s	3894.4	 attacks it. And there's always been this big question about kind of what causes autoimmune
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3898.2s	3898.2	 conditions and what causes immune system dysregulation like this. And there's all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3901.9s	3901.9	 sorts of different theories and studies and papers, many of which have been, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3905.7s	3905.7	 well documented genetic risk factors, environmental factors, age. And in particular, as you get older,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3911.4s	3911.4	 the thymus, which is supposed to create these helper cells that go out and keep cells in your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3917.2s	3917.2	 immune system from attacking your own body, your thymus kind of starts to fade away, or sorry,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3921.8s	3921.8	 your thymus starts to fade away and start to stop working. And so, you know, one theory that's been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3927.0s	3927.0	 talked about a lot is molecular mimicry, which means that there's some protein from a virus or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3932.7s	3932.7	 that enters your body or cancer. And that protein looks a lot like some other protein in your body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3938.5s	3938.5	 And so your immune system starts attacking that protein. And as a result, your immune system gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3942.4s	3942.4	 turned on to that protein. And it actually attacks a similar looking protein somewhere else in your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3947.4s	3947.4	 body. And that's a, you know, very kind of broad statement about, you know, some potential cause
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3953.3s	3953.3	 of autoimmune conditions. And you can find protein mimicry theories coming from the gut,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3958.4s	3958.4	 where, you know, microbes in the gut are triggering this, and then also viruses. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3962.3s	3962.3	 in particular, you know, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, which we're going to talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3966.4s	3966.4	 about here today. So multiple sclerosis is this disease, one of the autoimmune diseases,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3972.3s	3972.3	 where your immune system attacks and destroys myelin, which is, you know, found on your nerve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3978.9s	3978.9	 cells and in your brain. And it can actually cause, you know, when this happens, and your immune
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3984.8s	3984.8	 system starts to attack your brain, you end up with these lesions and really debilitating effects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3989.2s	3989.2	 over time. One in 300 people in the US have been diagnosed with MS. It is a brutal disease. It
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=3996.0s	3996.0	 lasts your whole life. And the treatment today, the primary treatment is this drug that destroys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4002.1s	4002.1	 B cells in your body. And your B cells make antibodies. And so by destroying the B cells,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4007.0s	4007.0	 it gets rid of the cells that are making the antibodies that are attacking your own brain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4013.1s	4013.1	 And this is a really effective treatment. It's been able to reduce the effects of MS significantly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4018.2s	4018.2	 but we still don't know what causes it and what triggers MS. And there's always been this theory,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4022.1s	4022.1	 going back to the mimicry question, that one of these viruses that everyone seems to get as they,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4027.6s	4027.6	 you know, age is causing it. And so Epstein-Barr virus has always been thought to be one of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4033.2s	4033.2	 viruses. It's one of the herpes viruses. Everyone knows it as mono. So, you know, you get mono and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4038.8s	4038.8	 you get swollen neck, a lot of people do. Most people that get this virus don't end up having
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4043.3s	4043.3	 any symptoms that are even though they have it. And here's a crazy statistic. 95% of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4048.6s	4048.6	 have Epstein-Barr virus. And it's known that Epstein-Barr virus does actually cause some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4053.7s	4053.7	 kinds of cancers and lymphoma and so on. So here's the paper that was published yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4061.0s	4061.0	 And again, if you know that Epstein-Barr virus, you know, is doing some other stuff in your body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4066.9s	4066.9	 that's negative, shouldn't this be a reason to look at it for MS? But how do you get the data to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4071.3s	4071.3	 it given that 95% of people already have Epstein-Barr virus? So here's what happened. These guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4077.9s	4077.9	 at Harvard went to the military, the US military, and the US military basically had 10 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4084.8s	4084.8	 members of the military take 62 million blood samples over a period of time from 1993 to 2013.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4091.3s	4091.3	 And when they take these blood samples, they run their typical checkup on these people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4095.8s	4095.8	 on the military members, but they save some of the blood sample in a freezer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4099.6s	4099.6	 And so they've got 62 million blood samples sitting in freezers, the US military does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4105.0s	4105.0	 And so these researchers were able to access those blood samples. And they then found 5% of the people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4111.6s	4111.6	 that don't have Epstein-Barr virus, because remember 95% of people have it. So they found the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4115.4s	4115.4	 5% that don't. And they went through and they found that during this period of time, that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4120.6s	4120.6	 have all this blood data for, they were able to identify 800 people that started out Epstein-Barr
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4127.1s	4127.1	 virus negative, and then got MS. 100% of the people that got MS were infected with Epstein-Barr virus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4134.3s	4134.3	 during this period of time. And for the group of people that didn't get MS, only about half of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4141.0s	4141.0	 got Epstein-Barr virus infection during this period of time. And then they looked at this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4144.6s	4144.6	 for about 20 other viruses, and basically showed absolutely no correlation or difference in risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4150.3s	4150.3	 between all the other viruses if you got MS or didn't get MS. And so it basically creates a 95%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4155.9s	4155.9	 probability that you're 32 times more likely to get MS from Epstein-Barr virus than from anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4162.1s	4162.1	 else. It is from a racially diverse pool, an age diverse pool, ethnically diverse pool. So a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4168.1s	4168.1	 other confounding factors like race or ethnicity or genetics, a lot of other factors like all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4173.6s	4173.6	 other viruses that might be causing MS have been excluded. And it shows that maybe Epstein-Barr
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4177.9s	4177.9	 virus is the primary cause of MS that triggers certain people's immune systems to go nuts and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4184.2s	4184.2	 attack the brain. And it's interesting because Epstein-Barr virus has a bunch of proteins in it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4188.7s	4188.7	 that look like other human proteins. So it makes sense why this might happen. MS costs 40 grand a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4194.8s	4194.8	 year. There's $30 billion a year spent in the US on MS care. So if we can go in and get Epstein-Barr
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4201.4s	4201.4	 virus eliminated from the human body, it would be an incredible cost saving and a therapeutic benefit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4207.3s	4207.3	 to people with MS. You should talk about the reason why we don't have a herpes vaccine though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4212.7s	4212.7	 So HSV 1, 2, 3, now 4. None of these things have reasonable vaccines. And it's for a very specific
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4220.8s	4220.8	 reason, which is that the herpes virus itself is incredibly, incredibly difficult to isolate and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4228.0s	4228.0	 find until it activates. And it hides itself and it nests itself inside these nerve cells. So you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4233.8s	4233.8	 may want to just talk about how complicated it is to produce a herpes vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4236.1s	4236.1	 I mean, the DNA disappears into these nerve cells. And so it's hard to get an immune
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4241.9s	4241.9	 system to go and clear them out permanently. The Epstein-Barr virus hides out in the B cells in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4247.9s	4247.9	 your body. And so it's floating around in your body forever. And as your B cells replicate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4253.0s	4253.0	 the virus replicates with them. And then when your immune system starts to get weak,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4256.0s	4256.0	 the virus pops out and starts attacking and inflaming your body again. So number one,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4260.9s	4260.9	 Epstein-Barr virus has never been a great therapeutic target because there's not much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4264.5s	4264.5	 money to be made because it's like, who the hell cares about mono? Once you get mono,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4267.1s	4267.1	 you get over it, you're fine. But if Epstein-Barr virus is in fact causing this problem with MS,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4273.4s	4273.4	 there's a reason to go after it, a lot of money to go after it. And there are several new technologies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4277.8s	4277.8	 and therapeutic strategies that are possible, one of which is Chimath sent out over a group
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4282.4s	4282.4	 tech company that's doing T cell therapies. We can actually program a T cell and the T cell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4287.4s	4287.4	 goes into the body and finds these B cells with Epstein-Barr virus and wipes them out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4293.2s	4293.2	 There's a steroid, a diuretic steroid that's used to treat high blood pressure, that's been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4298.6s	4298.6	 shown to stop Epstein-Barr virus from leaving cells. There's an antiviral drug made by Taquita
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4303.5s	4303.5	 called Maribivir, which has been shown to have high efficacy in eliminating Epstein-Barr virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4309.2s	4309.2	 So there are now therapeutic strategies that are being actively explored that could unlock the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4314.2s	4314.2	 potential of minimizing or eliminating Epstein-Barr virus for a broader population than we ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4319.9s	4319.9	 thought should be taking these therapies. Because the implications may be that if you can stop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4324.1s	4324.1	 Epstein-Barr virus from replicating or eliminating from your body, you can stop all these follow on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4328.6s	4328.6	 diseases that occur over time in your life that are super debilitating and costly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4332.8s	4332.8	 Yeah, lupus is another one that's tied to herpes simplex IV. I think the real problem is going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4339.5s	4339.5	 be that two-thirds of the adult population under the age of 55 have herpes simplex IV.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4346.2s	4346.2	 So you're literally talking about inoculating the entire world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4350.4s	4350.4	 When we start to think about that grand of a scale, there's a cost issue, there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4355.5s	4355.5	 manufacturability issue, and then there's an ROI issue that unfortunately will be adjudicated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4363.0s	4363.0	 That to me is what really stands out. That is just the healthcare economics of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4369.2s	4369.2	 Obviously, the science of it is still really complicated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4371.6s	4371.6	 Aren't we doing an mRNA vaccine for Epstein-Barr? How would that play into this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4378.2s	4378.2	 Absolutely. There's a lot of techniques. This is T-cell therapeutics, mRNA,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4383.3s	4383.3	 a chemotherapy-type drug, a steroid drug, an antiviral drug. Every modality for therapeutics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4392.0s	4392.0	 has some candidate or candidates for Epstein-Barr virus. There may be a bunch of ways that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4398.5s	4398.5	 start to identify risk factors and that you give someone one particular therapy that might be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4403.5s	4403.5	 really affordable. This antiviral may be super affordable. If we could make it for five cents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4407.4s	4407.4	 a pill, you could get it out to a lot of people prophylactically that are at high risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4414.2s	4414.2	 If there's a group that actually is active with MS, a good treatment may be to try and give them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4418.9s	4418.9	 the T-cell therapy and see if that helps. That's the clinical trials that will start now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4423.3s	4423.3	 because if you can give people a T-cell therapy and eliminate EBV and stop all future need for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4429.0s	4429.0	 MS treatment, that'll save 40 grand a year. It'll start to make sense to run clinical studies to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4433.4s	4433.4	 if that stuff's possible and is worth doing. It opens up a whole new area of interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4440.6s	4440.6	 By the way, this isn't novel. People have been talking about this for a long time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4442.8s	4442.8	 but this paper has such incredible data and such strong signal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4446.9s	4446.9	 that it's really going to catalyze investment. If we didn't have the big data based on this study,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4451.8s	4451.8	 we would not have gotten here. For once on the show, I will say thank God for the US government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4455.8s	4455.8	 and all of the data that they've collected, all of these blood samples that they kept in freezers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4461.0s	4461.0	 I want to get your read on the human transplant thing that we saw this week where a genetically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4465.4s	4465.4	 modified pig heart was implanted into a 57-year-old man. Jason, you want to read that out?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4471.0s	4471.0	 Oh, yeah. David Bennett, a 57-year-old man, requested special emergency authorization for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4474.6s	4474.6	 the experimental surgery from the FDA. He was dying and unable to receive a human heart transplant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4480.0s	4480.0	 The surgery was performed on January 7th in Baltimore. This happened as the US is facing a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4487.6s	4487.6	 major organ shortage. We have hundreds of thousands of people on organ donor registries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4495.4s	4495.4	 or needing a transplant. My father was on a kidney transplant registry for eight years until he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4501.4s	4501.4	 passed away. These things are just brutalizing for the individuals and the family around it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4507.4s	4507.4	 All of a sudden, if you can see a path where you can genetically modify other sources of organs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4514.3s	4514.3	 and implant them without organ rejection into the human body, that's mind-blowing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4521.3s	4521.3	 Here's what's really important. It's not just about the availability of these things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4525.0s	4525.0	 but it's about turning off one of the biggest... The big risk factor of organ transplant is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4530.7s	4530.7	 rejection, meaning you're putting all this foreign matter into your body.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4538.8s	4538.8	 your body goes haywire and tries to kill it. Imagine getting a billion viruses at once.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4545.1s	4545.1	 There are all these new proteins. One of the interesting things you can do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4550.4s	4550.4	 if you can grow these organs and alter the genetics of the cells that are being used to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4557.4s	4557.4	 grow the organs is you can get those cells to match your own or to basically down-regulate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4563.6s	4563.6	 all of the proteins that might be triggering immune rejection in your body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4568.2s	4568.2	 Theoretically, you could grow J-Cal's heart with tissue and cells that match your DNA potentially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4573.4s	4573.4	 and match your protein structure perfectly. If Sass had a heart, you could do it with him too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4578.5s	4578.5	 Right. There you go. Good transition. By the way, there may also be a path here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4586.1s	4586.1	 where we grow these organs with your DNA without even using the entire key of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4594.4s	4594.4	 rest of the animal to do so. There are a lot of really interesting breakthroughs that are possible,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4599.7s	4599.7	 but it's really great to see a highlighted non-transplanted organ from another body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4606.6s	4606.6	 into the human body because it just, again, it opens up what people have been talking about for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4610.7s	4610.7	 decades, which is the possibility of this now that we have gene editing and potentially have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4614.6s	4614.6	 the ability to grow biological matter in bioreactors. It's going to be tremendous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4620.2s	4620.2	 J-Cal, what do you think about the Democratic person in the SEC saying that they wanted to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4625.1s	4625.1	 basically make the accredited investor laws even stricter? That's incredibly infuriating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4631.7s	4631.7	 That was your big prediction. Yeah. I mean, we really have to get these laws. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4636.5s	4636.5	 I think this is like a Theranos or WeWork overreaction, which is like, oh my God,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4642.6s	4642.6	 there are some bad private companies. If you take the number of bad private companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4647.0s	4647.0	 and then look at what is happening in the country with people wagering on sports and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4651.1s	4651.1	 wagering on crypto slash investing, depending on how you look at it, we need to have one rule
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4657.7s	4657.7	 for the road, which is people take a test, they get accredited, and then they can do what they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4662.6s	4662.6	 want with their money. The equivalent of what I'm suggesting, people can only invest a fraction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4668.6s	4668.6	 of the money they have on their last two years tax returns. Let's pick a number 5% of their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4674.6s	4674.6	 two year average on their tax returns, 10%, whatever you want to pick, and they have to take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4678.3s	4678.3	 a test with the would be the equivalent of people having to take a three hour course and a, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4685.5s	4685.5	 I don't know, 50 question test to go to Vegas and play blackjack. And they could only put on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4690.6s	4690.6	 blackjack table 10% of their total average yearly income for their household in the past year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4698.1s	4698.1	 You think about how crazy that would be to tell an American, you got to take a blackjack course
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4703.4s	4703.4	 and pass a blackjack test and understand the odds of poker or whatever to play that game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4707.6s	4707.6	 And you can only put if you made $50,000 on hours last year, you can only bet 5000 in Vegas had any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4712.9s	4712.9	 one time that's the max chips you can buy in a year. Those are the two things I'm advocating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4716.6s	4716.6	 for in private company investing. And that's really if we want to have people move from,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4721.5s	4721.5	 you know, poor to middle class from middle class to affluent in this country, there has to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4726.6s	4726.6	 equity participation, and equity participation has to start early. Look at what happened with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4731.8s	4731.8	 all these young people betting on crypto, betting on stocks, or stonks, and, you know, doing puts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4738.7s	4738.7	 and calls and all kinds of crazy things. You know, in public markets, we would really rather see those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4744.6s	4744.6	 people, or at least in addition, be able to invest on LinkedIn if they were a recruiter in year two,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4753.6s	4753.6	 or they were an Uber driver be able to buy Uber shares, or if they were an Airbnb host be able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4758.6s	4758.6	 buy Airbnb shares as a private company will change the entire complexion of upward mobility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4765.0s	4765.0	 in the United States. And we really have to keep educating people not limiting their upside. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4770.9s	4770.9	 my personal belief. Personally, I asked you the question stop paying attention like five minutes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4774.5s	4774.5	 ago. Oh, because we're talking about science and hearts. No, I asked you a simple question,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4779.1s	4779.1	 like 15 minutes ago and like you just been that was a 90 second monologue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4784.8s	4784.8	 By the way, I got inside information on sacks. You know how sacks started like doing a little bit of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4792.4s	4792.4	 artistic direction. He's got that Scorsese and I'm having done the award winning film. Thank you for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbeHyN15HQE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=72&t=4797.0s	4797.0	 smoking and he he got Henry Bell cast around his team. You know, the tick tock guys, tick tock guys
