https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=0.0s	0.0	 So, Saks, are we going to talk with each other today or, you know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3.0s	3.0	 He's an ISO player. He turned into an ISO player.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4.9s	4.9	 He's like the Carmelo Anthony of this squad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=7.1s	7.1	 He's the Carmelo Anthony of the All-In Pug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=9.0s	9.0	 Saks, you want to pass the ball or you just want to clank it off the rim?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=13.0s	13.0	 Raymond, clank!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=14.2s	14.2	 I think we should have a focus on having a dialogue with each other today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=16.9s	16.9	 Several points in the thing, as opposed to all standing up, saying our piece and then hopping off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=20.2s	20.2	 Saks, we lost a little bit of the fiber of this team here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=22.9s	22.9	 There's three people playing as a team and then there's like...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=24.8s	24.8	 Saks, I would love to ask you questions and I would love for you to ask me questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=27.2s	27.2	 So, I'm going to pass the ball, J Cal. You're the f***ing guard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=30.0s	30.0	 You pass the ball. I'm supposed to score.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=31.8s	31.8	 Oh, really?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=32.6s	32.6	 Remember what Shaq used to say when he wasn't getting the ball?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=36.2s	36.2	 He gets really unhappy. He said, pass the ball to the big dog. You'll score.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=39.8s	39.8	 Yeah, I'm Shaq. You're not Kobe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=42.1s	42.1	 Who is the shitty little like...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=44.4s	44.4	 Derek Fisher?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=45.2s	45.2	 Yeah, you're Derek Fisher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=46.8s	46.8	 Make sure the big dog gets the ball. There won't be any problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=49.0s	49.0	 I'm Bob Cousy, OK?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=50.3s	50.3	 I'm Gary Payton in this f***ing anatomy gear, OK?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=57.1s	57.1	 Rain Man David Sa...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=69.8s	69.8	 Hey, everybody. Welcome to the All In Podcast,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=73.0s	73.0	 where three besties talk about a range of topics and one monologues about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=78.3s	78.3	 Biden Derangement Syndrome with you again this week, the Sultan of Science
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=83.0s	83.0	 and the dictator,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=84.5s	84.5	 Chamath Palihapitiya, David Friedberg, and playing ISO ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=88.6s	88.6	 Somewhere in the wing is your political commentator, Tucker Jr.,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=93.6s	93.6	 Rain Man David Saqs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=96.6s	96.6	 It's an active projection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=97.8s	97.8	 In our first story, which Saqs is going to lose his mind over,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=101.6s	101.6	 he's got two monologues prepared,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=103.8s	103.8	 Justin Trudeau has invoked an emergency order to freeze bank accounts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=108.1s	108.1	 linked to trucker protests in Canada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=111.6s	111.6	 On Monday, Trudeau invoked an emergency law that requires
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=114.6s	114.6	 financial institutions in Canada to examine customer records
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=118.6s	118.6	 and take action against people involved with or aiding in the protest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=122.6s	122.6	 Here's Trudeau's tweet from yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=124.7s	124.7	 If you're watching on the video streams, illegal blockades and occupations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=128.9s	128.9	 are not peaceful protests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=130.4s	130.4	 They're a threat to jobs and communities, and they cannot continue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=133.5s	133.5	 In the House of Commons earlier today, I joined members of the parliament
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=136.2s	136.2	 to speak about that and about the need to invoke the Emergencies Act.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=141.5s	141.5	 The counter signal, which is a right-leaning Canadian digital publication,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=144.5s	144.5	 reported that 34 different crypto wallets were also being targeted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=148.6s	148.6	 by Canadian officials.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=151.3s	151.3	 This law grants the government extraordinary powers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=154.6s	154.6	 like the right to ban public assembly in certain locations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=157.5s	157.5	 The Canadian Civil Liberties Association said it planned to challenge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=159.8s	159.8	 the government's decision in court.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=162.9s	162.9	 Remember, Saqs wrote a piece on financial deplatforming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=167.1s	167.1	 for Barry Weiss's Common Sense about a year ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=170.2s	170.2	 The piece was about the private sector financial platforms deplatforming folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=175.3s	175.3	 Your thoughts, Saqs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=176.6s	176.6	 You have 90 seconds on the uninterrupted clock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=178.9s	178.9	 On the shot clock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=181.0s	181.0	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=181.2s	181.2	 Thank you, Jay Kelly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=182.0s	182.0	 It's true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=182.8s	182.8	 Last summer, I wrote a piece for Barry Weiss's substack talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=188.0s	188.0	 how financial deplatforming would be the next wave of online censorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=191.7s	191.7	 Here we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=192.6s	192.6	 It's actually happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=193.7s	193.7	 What I could not have predicted is that it would occur
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=196.8s	196.8	 in our mild mannered neighbor to the north
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=199.7s	199.7	 and that the reprisals would be directed by the government itself,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=204.2s	204.2	 not just a consortium of private actors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=207.6s	207.6	 What Trudeau has done is he didn't just employ the Emergency Act
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=212.4s	212.4	 against the truckers so that he could basically arrest them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=215.5s	215.5	 and break up the protest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=217.0s	217.0	 They have now directed banks and any financial institution,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=221.3s	221.3	 even cryptocurrency wallets, to freeze the accounts,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=224.5s	224.5	 not just to the truckers, but to anybody who's contributed to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=227.8s	227.8	 Basically, anyone who's contributed $25 or more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=231.0s	231.0	 There were two crowdfunding sites that they raised money from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=233.8s	233.8	 All those people, the thousands of just ordinary Canadians
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=237.7s	237.7	 who did nothing more than contribute to an anti-government protest,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=241.6s	241.6	 they are now at risk of financial ruin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=244.3s	244.3	 because their bank accounts have been frozen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=246.8s	246.8	 You have to wonder, what is the end here that justifies the means?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=251.8s	251.8	 COVID, Omerkhan is on the wane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=254.1s	254.1	 It's on its way out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=255.2s	255.2	 At the same time that Trudeau was announcing these dictatorial measures,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=260.0s	260.0	 Ford, the guy who runs Ontario, the largest province,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=265.8s	265.8	 Ford was out there saying that COVID mandates were going to be over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=270.7s	270.7	 Why exactly are they doing this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=273.4s	273.4	 We're at the end of COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=274.6s	274.6	 Zach, let me ask you a question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=279.0s	279.0	 If there were people online making donations to the criminals who loot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=283.6s	283.6	 and kill people in San Francisco, which you've railed against,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=287.0s	287.0	 being criminals who are breaking the law and should all be put behind bars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=290.7s	290.7	 do you think that it would be appropriate in that context for the government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=293.9s	293.9	 to block their donations to supporting criminal activity in a criminal ring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=299.3s	299.3	 that I think we all agree shouldn't be transpiring?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=304.5s	304.5	 The implication there is that truckers are using violence or something like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=308.9s	308.9	 and they're not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=309.4s	309.4	 I mean, it's been largely a peaceful protest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=312.0s	312.0	 It's been very annoying to people who's...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=315.1s	315.1	 But isn't the case being made that they are actually breaking the law
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=317.9s	317.9	 by blocking streets and that's not...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=319.6s	319.6	 There's a peaceful protest where you can go and get a permit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=321.8s	321.8	 and actually go in a public zone and peacefully protest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=324.7s	324.7	 within the confines of the law and what's allowed in that jurisdiction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=328.2s	328.2	 Look...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=328.6s	328.6	 But what these folks are doing is civil disobedience,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=331.5s	331.5	 which is not a peaceful protest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=333.1s	333.1	 It is kind of breaking the law to make a point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=336.2s	336.2	 It is peaceful because there's been no violence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=338.5s	338.5	 If you look at actual videos...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=339.5s	339.5	 But they're breaking the law, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=342.1s	342.1	 Let me ask the question for Freeberg then, Sax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=345.4s	345.4	 If a group of truckers were shutting down the Bay Bridge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=350.2s	350.2	 with three lanes of traffic and then shut down the 280 and the 101,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=354.8s	354.8	 and it impacted this, if they in fact are shutting down roads...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=358.6s	358.6	 And picking up our families and our businesses and our emergency travel...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=361.2s	361.2	 And ambulances can't get through, would you want them to be towed?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=364.6s	364.6	 Would you want their cars to be towed?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=365.8s	365.8	 Listen, here's the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=367.5s	367.5	 The Ambassador Bridge, this vital choke point of commerce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=370.6s	370.6	 between the US and Canada, that was blocked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=372.7s	372.7	 and that was creating a serious problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=374.1s	374.1	 But it had already been cleared on Monday
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=376.8s	376.8	 by the time that Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=379.4s	379.4	 And then on Tuesday, he then invokes the Financial Act.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=382.9s	382.9	 Your opinion, Sax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=383.8s	383.8	 If they block roads and bridges, would you, if you were in charge...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=387.4s	387.4	 If they're breaking the law...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=388.6s	388.6	 Yeah, if they're breaking the law in that way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=390.3s	390.3	 it's not just one lane, it's all three lanes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=392.5s	392.5	 Damages society.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=393.4s	393.4	 I'm just trying to understand the standard here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=395.7s	395.7	 because just zooming out to last year and the year before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=399.4s	399.4	 there was a protest happening with BLM.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=401.9s	401.9	 And those BLM protests resulted in damage to private property,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=407.0s	407.0	 to burning cars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=408.9s	408.9	 There were protests at the Capitol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=411.0s	411.0	 that involved folks trespassing into federal land and federal buildings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=415.5s	415.5	 And now there's protests that are blocking vital trade routes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=420.6s	420.6	 and access to emergency vehicles and all this sort of stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=423.7s	423.7	 To me, and also people in San Francisco breaking the law
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=426.8s	426.8	 and not being put in jail,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=428.1s	428.1	 my personal opinion is anyone that's breaking the law,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=430.6s	430.6	 we should stop them from breaking the law.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=432.6s	432.6	 And anyone that wants to follow a peaceful protest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=435.6s	435.6	 or make a point should make the point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=437.9s	437.9	 But if the law is the law,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=439.0s	439.0	 shouldn't there be a universal standard to hold up the law?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=441.5s	441.5	 And if the cases people are giving money to aid in breaking the law,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=446.6s	446.6	 shouldn't we stop the transmission of that money?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=449.8s	449.8	 Hold on a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=450.8s	450.8	 Look, I think you're conflating a bunch of really important things there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=455.0s	455.0	 Aiding and abetting criminals is already illegal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=458.6s	458.6	 There are RICO statutes that allow the authorities to go after people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=463.8s	463.8	 that are aiding and abetting through monetary support criminal behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=469.9s	469.9	 Separately, there's a whole body of law at the federal, state, local level
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=474.7s	474.7	 that allows you to deal with protests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=476.9s	476.9	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=477.9s	477.9	 The real question is why did you have to go and invoke emergency powers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=482.3s	482.3	 at the tail end of a pandemic for what is effectively nonviolent protests?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=488.3s	488.3	 Again, that's the key question, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=490.4s	490.4	 So just to give you some Canadian history,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=493.4s	493.4	 as a Canadian citizen, what I can tell you is that we've invoked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=496.5s	496.5	 this Emergency Powers Act three times in the past.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=499.8s	499.8	 The first was for World War II.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=502.4s	502.4	 The second, sorry, World War I.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=504.3s	504.3	 The second was for World War II.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=505.8s	505.8	 And the third was the FLQ crisis, which was a domestic terrorist organization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=509.4s	509.4	 in Quebec that was fighting for a separate homeland.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=513.4s	513.4	 Those are the three other times in the past that a sitting prime minister
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=516.2s	516.2	 has invoked these broad sweeping emergency powers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=520.3s	520.3	 And they did it because you exhaust the natural body of law
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=523.5s	523.5	 and the Constitution and the Bill of, you know, the Charter of Rights
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=526.2s	526.2	 that governs the normal behavior of a democratic society.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=530.8s	530.8	 What this was is not any of those things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=533.0s	533.0	 I don't think anybody could claim that a bunch of nonviolent protests,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=536.5s	536.5	 yes, they were annoying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=537.9s	537.9	 Yes, they basically, you know, stop some commerce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=540.8s	540.8	 But I don't think it was on the order of World War I, World War II,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=544.2s	544.2	 or a domestic terrorism issue like the FLQ crisis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=547.5s	547.5	 So why invoke this basically get out of jail free card
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=551.0s	551.0	 where you can behave without any checks and balances?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=553.4s	553.4	 This is the confounding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=554.4s	554.4	 Hold on a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=555.2s	555.2	 Did we exhaust the current body of normal governing law?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=561.2s	561.2	 And if we didn't, why is this example okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=565.0s	565.0	 And the counterfactuals are so many.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=567.5s	567.5	 Imagine Trump invoked this thing during BLM.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=571.4s	571.4	 Imagine Biden did this right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=573.0s	573.0	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=573.6s	573.6	 You would be up in arms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=575.7s	575.7	 I think that's well said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=576.6s	576.6	 And it means that the Emergencies Act that Trudeau invoked requires
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=581.1s	581.1	 something like an act of espionage against the country or Syria,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=585.9s	585.9	 the word serious violence or in the law or the threat of serious violence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=590.4s	590.4	 Those conditions were simply not met.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=593.6s	593.6	 And then on top of that, to go after people who contribute as little as $25 to these truckers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=599.2s	599.2	 who are trying to support them because these guys are not making any money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=604.3s	604.3	 They're living under very harsh conditions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=606.2s	606.2	 So you make a small check.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=608.0s	608.0	 You write a small donation to support these people, to aid them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=611.0s	611.0	 They're simple working class people who are protesting for normalcy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=615.6s	615.6	 and to get their freedom back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=616.9s	616.9	 And now all of a sudden your bank account gets frozen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=619.3s	619.3	 It is basically creating a...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=622.5s	622.5	 It's going to have a chilling effect because it's essentially creating a cast of untouchables
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=626.7s	626.7	 because no one is going to want to associate with, transact with or donate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=630.6s	630.6	 to this group of people, these designated people now under the Emergencies Act
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=635.8s	635.8	 who your bank account can get frozen if you deal with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=638.3s	638.3	 I think it's going to have the opposite effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=639.7s	639.7	 I think there's going to blow up in Trudeau's face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=641.4s	641.4	 This is the worst decision making by any major political leader in a long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=646.2s	646.2	 To go after a group of people, as Chamath said, in the waning days of a pandemic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=650.7s	650.7	 what is the point?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=652.1s	652.1	 Why are we picking this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=653.1s	653.1	 Why is he picking this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=654.1s	654.1	 Why do you guys think...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=655.1s	655.1	 So why do you think he is?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=655.7s	655.7	 It makes no sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=656.5s	656.5	 But why is he doing it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=657.5s	657.5	 And Chamath, why did the police not break...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=660.3s	660.3	 So I totally hear your point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=662.0s	662.0	 Why did the police not break up these protests?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=664.2s	664.2	 Why did he need to invoke the emergency?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=665.4s	665.4	 No, they haven't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=666.6s	666.6	 Because look...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=667.4s	667.4	 It happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=668.6s	668.6	 I think that the police in some cases did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=671.2s	671.2	 In some cases didn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=672.6s	672.6	 There were probably a lot of police sympathizers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=675.0s	675.0	 There were probably a lot of sympathizers in general,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=677.5s	677.5	 as there were a lot of people who were detractors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=679.8s	679.8	 Are you saying there were police that were complicit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=683.0s	683.0	 It's the nature of a protest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=684.9s	684.9	 You have people for, you have people against.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=687.3s	687.3	 But the point is, I think what's really clear is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=690.2s	690.2	 Justin Trudeau first basically said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=694.7s	694.7	 these people are racists and misogynists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=697.6s	697.6	 Then he said, they just hold views that are just unacceptable to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=701.4s	701.4	 And then like a totalitarian dictator,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=703.7s	703.7	 invoked an emergency measures act that allows him to do what he wants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=708.1s	708.1	 That's the fact pattern.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=709.2s	709.2	 He painted himself into a political corner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=711.8s	711.8	 and then tried to give successfully,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=713.7s	713.7	 he gave himself absolute power for some period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=717.0s	717.0	 And the real question, I think, is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=718.6s	718.6	 why should this be allowed to happen in a democratic country,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=721.6s	721.6	 with democratic norms against people that haven't done,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=724.9s	724.9	 as far as I can tell, a shred of violent behavior?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=728.7s	728.7	 No, it hasn't been violent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=730.2s	730.2	 And where it's clear that the body of normal governing law hasn't been exhausted yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=735.8s	735.8	 Meaning, the minute that these people were asked to actually empty the Ambassador Bridge,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=742.2s	742.2	 they did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=743.0s	743.0	 Guys, we're Canadians.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=744.0s	744.0	 That's what we do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=744.9s	744.9	 Yes, we love to protest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=746.1s	746.1	 But if you just ask us, we're just going to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=748.3s	748.3	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=749.0s	749.0	 No, you're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=749.6s	749.6	 Trudeau never tried talking to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=751.2s	751.2	 I mean, why wouldn't he just try and negotiate with them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=754.8s	754.8	 Instead, he demonized them right off the bat as white supremacists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=758.6s	758.6	 and Nazis and even confederates, which I don't even understand in the context of Canada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=763.9s	763.9	 This is yet another example of the dying death right in front of us of the woke playbook.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=770.6s	770.6	 We talked about this last week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=772.3s	772.3	 I think it's related to the San Francisco Board of Ed recall that's now national
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=776.6s	776.6	 and probably even international news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=778.1s	778.1	 I'm excited about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=779.6s	779.6	 The reaction to Rogan, the reaction to Dave Chappelle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=784.0s	784.0	 it's all part and parcel of this thing where people up and down the spectrum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=788.6s	788.6	 have learned what the mechanism of action is of this cancel culture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=792.8s	792.8	 and they don't fall for it anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=794.2s	794.2	 Yeah, Trudeau did not get the memo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=796.1s	796.1	 There's a person that's able to escalate it because he's actually in a seat of power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=799.8s	799.8	 And that's what I think people should be debating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=801.9s	801.9	 You mean shutting down dissenting voices from a position of power?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=805.1s	805.1	 Just because and he went on the record.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=806.3s	806.3	 Unnecessarily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=807.4s	807.4	 He went on the record and he said, guys, these views are unacceptable to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=811.5s	811.5	 Well, in a democratic society, that's not how it works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=814.4s	814.4	 Yeah, not your choice, Justin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=815.7s	815.7	 I mean, I could have engaged them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=817.4s	817.4	 Views on all kinds of topics all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=820.2s	820.2	 Unacceptable is not the threshold of World War II, World War I and the FLQ crisis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=825.4s	825.4	 Do you guys think that there is a moment here that also is a mile marker on the road
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=830.1s	830.1	 towards the state versus crypto, given the actions that were taken against Bitcoin wallets?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=835.5s	835.5	 Because that seems to be like a big trend that's going to play out over the next decade or two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=840.4s	840.4	 Inevitably, crypto is the threat to the state, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=843.0s	843.0	 And so, you know, you're going to see skirmishes like this that kind of, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=847.8s	847.8	 wallets that donate are illegal and, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=850.6s	850.6	 Friedrich, this is one of the best points you've made.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=853.1s	853.1	 If you look at what this has done to Bitcoin and you look at what it's done for other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=856.4s	856.4	 cryptocurrencies, this will do more than McDonald's accepting Bitcoin because this is the first time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=861.4s	861.4	 like a Western democratic state is seizing people's funds like in an incredibly unfair,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=866.6s	866.6	 unnecessary way, which is just going to have more people say, you know what, maybe I should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=870.6s	870.6	 keep some of my net worth out of the government's purview if they're going to seize it anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=875.0s	875.0	 And then now people are going to start looking into the coins that allow people to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=879.0s	879.0	 You can't conflate having an enemy with having a different view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=883.3s	883.3	 100% Those aren't the same thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=885.0s	885.0	 Having an enemy is a serious deal, right? Whether that's domestic or international,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=890.2s	890.2	 that's what we had to do in World War I, World War II and the FLQ crisis. This is just somebody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=894.8s	894.8	 who has a different opinion. I don't agree in mask mandates is what one person says. I want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=899.4s	899.4	 to mask mandate is what the other person says. The idea that you can deep platform one or the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=905.0s	905.0	 fire them from their job or prevent them from having access to the money that they've earned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=909.4s	909.4	 or preventing other people from donating money. That's really, it's a really low bar. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=915.5s	915.5	 when you normalize this kind of behavior, it's a very slippery slope. And so if if somebody else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=920.9s	920.9	 were to do it, they now have like it's again, going back to the renege or sort of philosophical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=926.6s	926.6	 discussion from last week. One of the things about, you know, the stoning rituals, right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=932.2s	932.2	 that sacks talked about, that we talked about last week, one of the things that renege or talks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=936.6s	936.6	 about is it is always hardest for that first person, right? The first person that throws the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=944.6s	944.6	 stone, right? That's how Jesus was able to diffuse that, that incident as described in the book of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=949.2s	949.2	 john. But in a different example, the first person that throws a stone, all of a sudden normalizes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=954.3s	954.3	 it for everybody else after them. And then these stonings become commonplace or became commonplace.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=959.3s	959.3	 So similarly, it's like, if you're a sitting democratic person who just decides this doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=963.6s	963.6	 work for you, you can't flip the script. And and basically remove everybody's democratic rights.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=970.7s	970.7	 That's really crazy. Sacks, you had a closing point you wanted to make? Well, okay, just on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=975.8s	975.8	 point about Bitcoin, the reason why Bitcoin is necessary is because the tactics that Trudeau is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=981.2s	981.2	 using is essentially to starve these truckers out to not only basically arrest them, and but these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=987.7s	987.7	 also taking away their insurance licenses, he's basically preventing them from ever working again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=992.3s	992.3	 He's talked about that we're going to put give you a criminal record, it's gonna make it hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=995.2s	995.2	 for you to get a job. And then most importantly, on top of that, he's preventing anyone from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=999.8s	999.8	 helping them by contributing to them by making a donation. So he's essentially starving these guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1005.4s	1005.4	 out. And that's the reason why Bitcoin is potentially helpful is it allows people using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1010.3s	1010.3	 non custodial wallets to make an end run around that and donate and help these these people who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1015.8s	1015.8	 are being persecuted, essentially, I mean, he could have just simply chosen to do what Sacks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1021.5s	1021.5	 is favorite President Obama did with Occupy Wall Street, which is say, great, you have something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1026.4s	1026.4	 you want to voice, here's where you can do it. Just, you know, no guns, no violence. But we let
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1031.4s	1031.4	 how long did Occupy Wall Street last in downtown Wall Street and in Oakland and other places like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1036.6s	1036.6	 a year or two. And you just wait them out. And that's it. I think when you encounter a sincere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1041.3s	1041.3	 protest movement, the first thing you should do as leaders actually listen and try to understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1045.4s	1045.4	 what it is that they're protesting on behalf of. And Trudeau never did that he went straight to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1049.8s	1049.8	 a to 11 with this. And I think part of the reason why I mean, Jacob, you asked, why, why is it that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1055.8s	1055.8	 that, you know, there seems to be a common denominator with this and with the Ukraine issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1060.6s	1060.6	 that the leaders are immediately escalating these situations, instead of looking for a way to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1065.3s	1065.3	 de escalated, and they're doing it with the media egging them on. And so as as harsh as Trudeau's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1071.4s	1071.4	 rhetoric has been, the media's rhetoric around this has been even worse. You have this CNN

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1083.7s	1083.7	 needed to slash their tires, empty the gas tanks, arrest the drivers, you know, making it unclear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1089.0s	1089.0	 how you never get the trucks off the bridge. But then she said cancel their insurance, suspend their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1093.1s	1093.1	 driver's license, prohibit any future regulatory verification. She says, Trust me, I will not run
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1099.0s	1099.0	 out of ways to make this hurt. You know, it's you have the media cheering this on egging on Trudeau.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1105.7s	1105.7	 They're doing the same thing beating the drums of war on Ukraine. What is wrong with these people?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1111.0s	1111.0	 De escalate and where's the off ramp? I think the biggest the biggest story is this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1116.0s	1116.0	 this Bitcoin thing, because, you know, if you guys think about like, pre 1960s, like capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1123.4s	1123.4	 wasn't digitized, it was like physical, like you had to own like a stock certificate or cash or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1128.3s	1128.3	 gold or bearer bond. Today, everything is digitized, right? Like there's a digital record of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1134.4s	1134.4	 you know, who owns what stock and who how much is in your bank account, and none of it is tied to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1139.2s	1139.2	 your having a physical asset. And ultimately, the law was able to reach into these digital systems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1145.0s	1145.0	 and have greater oversight and ultimately control, you know, over accounts and so on. And it's had a,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1152.3s	1152.3	 you know, the digitization of capital assets has had an incredible ability to drive economic growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1157.5s	1157.5	 and investment and ease of transaction. But it's also significantly increased the centralization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1163.0s	1163.0	 of assets or the central influence over assets. Bitcoin seems to be the resolution to that. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1169.0s	1169.0	 now you're seeing the ultimate challenge to Bitcoin and the challenge to decentralized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1174.1s	1174.1	 systems like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and so on. I don't want to speak specifically to anyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1178.7s	1178.7	 But there seems to be like this trend line over the last 60 years that's now being challenged,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1183.6s	1183.6	 because you can have your accounts frozen any moment, you know, for breaking the law or because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1189.0s	1189.0	 emergency acts are are induced. And I think you're right, it's probably going to accelerate interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1193.7s	1193.7	 in these kind of off government chain. If true, it's a separate chain. Anybody can do it. They're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1200.9s	1200.9	 doing it in China, right? And they're, and I don't know, it's the point of it. The digital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1205.6s	1205.6	 of you on is like this incredible whole point. It's like absolute centralization of every capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1210.6s	1210.6	 asset. Here's where you get scary. Think about dangerous the digital you want is the minute you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1214.9s	1214.9	 say something that Xi Jinping doesn't like, it's a it's a stroke of a keyboard key. And all your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1219.8s	1219.8	 assets are all your assets are locked away. It's a database entry. And you just basically reroute who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1224.7s	1224.7	 belongs who belongs to or it could be it could happen in America. They say, you know what,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1228.2s	1228.2	 California now wants to have a wealth tax. Anybody who's got money, we're just going to take your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1232.3s	1232.3	 money out of your account automatically. Do you guys think we sound like a right wing politics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1236.3s	1236.3	 show at this point? This isn't a right wing politics thing. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1240.5s	1240.5	 I think that we have so jumped the shark, there are things that are happening today, every day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1245.0s	1245.0	 that you know, if you had said in isolation, two or three years ago, would any of these things ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1249.0s	1249.0	 happened? We all would have just looked at each other and said, it's impossible that these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1253.1s	1253.1	 could happen. But the problem is, fast forward two years of the pandemic, I think, we have let a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1258.8s	1258.8	 of our civil liberties decay right under our nose. And we're not willing to fight for it because it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1264.3s	1264.3	 become too tribal and rights have been politicized. So the idea of having rights,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1270.0s	1270.0	 you know, and then standing up for your rights, all of a sudden has to be a decision between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1273.9s	1273.9	 whether you're left or right. That's crazy. I don't think that liberties in the sense of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1278.6s	1278.6	 government oversight have decayed. In addition to that, liberties in the sense of a social setting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1286.2s	1286.2	 have decayed. You know, we've because of cancel culture, we've normalized the ability to silence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1292.4s	1292.4	 minority or dissenting voices. And this is both in the private enterprise setting as well as in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1297.2s	1297.2	 the public setting. And it's, you know, I don't know, I don't consider myself a right wing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1303.8s	1303.8	 conservative person by any stretch. But I do consider myself a person who believes in individual
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1309.5s	1309.5	 freedom and liberty. That's called an American, by the way. Yeah, it's basically being an American.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1313.6s	1313.6	 And I think, you know, as we move on to this recall in San Francisco, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1318.6s	1318.6	 Sachs made a really good point, like, what are our political leaders doing here? Are they trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1322.6s	1322.6	 stir the pot and antagonize these situations? If you look, you know, Clinton, Obama, a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1328.3s	1328.3	 people previously were trying to defuse these situations. And then Biden seems to be stirring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1332.7s	1332.7	 the pot, Justin Trudeau. And then if you look at Trump with BLM, you know, and the immigration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1337.8s	1337.8	 stuff, he never sat down and met with them. And he arguably antagonize them. So I think this is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1343.4s	1343.4	 perfect segue into what happened. And, you know, so we should expect a little more from our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1348.7s	1348.7	 political leaders. Great point from Sachs. You just brought up something incredible. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1352.6s	1352.6	 Trump railed against these BLM folks. But at no point did he try to shut down their bank accounts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1357.2s	1357.2	 and take their money away. And Trudeau, you know, this was not even near in the scale of BLM.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1363.6s	1363.6	 Yeah, who's the bigger authoritarian? Yeah, I mean, it's clearly if you objectively, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1366.9s	1366.9	 Trudeau in this situation. The scary authoritarianism, as we talked about in previous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1370.7s	1370.7	 pods tends to come from the left. At least the right you see it coming. I just want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1375.5s	1375.5	 read it's veiled under moral virtue signaling. That's right. They're very synchromonious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1379.6s	1379.6	 They claim they claim to be the defenders of the working class. While they're actually prosecuting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1385.4s	1385.4	 them. Such an unforced error, like, so dumb. He's gonna lose right? He's gonna lose. If a DA was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1392.1s	1392.1	 elected and a police office and police chief were elected to San Francisco, that said we are going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1396.9s	1396.9	 to freeze the bank accounts and, you know, demobilize the criminals that are ransacking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1403.8s	1403.8	 our city, our people, our stores, would you support that? No, not if it's an extrajudicial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1411.8s	1411.8	 use of power. I mean, the law specifies what you're allowed to do. Giving San Francisco's in an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1416.1s	1416.1	 emergency situation. I mean, would you support the mayor taking on emergency authority to go and fix
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1421.2s	1421.2	 the problem, which she just did, by the way, in the Tenderloin? Yeah, but that doesn't give her the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1425.1s	1425.1	 power to go to Wells Fargo and say to Wells Fargo, we want you to freeze all these accounts with no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1430.6s	1430.6	 due process of law. That's basically what true. That's the overreach. That's the line you think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1436.6s	1436.6	 is like going to see that you should have to go through a court proceeding to free someone's bank
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1441.1s	1441.1	 account. Period. Can't just freeze someone's bank account. The law allows you to do this now. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1446.3s	1446.3	 called Rico. So you follow the due process of the law. And you can do all those things, Friedberg,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1452.3s	1452.3	 that you just mentioned. If you want to free somebody's bank account, you can actually do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1456.4s	1456.4	 that. The government has the ability to do that. They don't need to pass this basically get out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1461.0s	1461.0	 jail free card to do whatever you want without any oversight. And to Jermot's point earlier,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1466.3s	1466.3	 have you exhausted the regular law here? They haven't even tried. You can buy Fentanyl for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1473.2s	1473.2	 five bucks on, you know, the Tenderloin any time you want. And meanwhile, all the provinces are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1477.9s	1477.9	 ending COVID mandates anyway. So this whole issue is moot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1481.1s	1481.1	 So dumb. It's this is like the stupidest behavior at the end of a pandemic that we've ever seen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1486.2s	1486.2	 And shout out to George Lucas for getting it right. I mean, if you look at the theme of Star Wars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1491.2s	1491.2	 it was like, Oh, I just need emergency powers for a minute because of a trade federation blockade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1495.8s	1495.8	 And here we go. A fake crisis. A fake crisis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1498.3s	1498.3	 Yeah, that wasn't George Lucas, by the way. I mean, that goes back to the Roman Empire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1502.8s	1502.8	 But he kind of nailed it. Right? Like, yeah. Yeah. That was the formation of the empire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1507.3s	1507.3	 Caesar got emergency authority. I mean, this is a tried and true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1509.8s	1509.8	 And the polls show that most of the public in Canada is applauding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1516.2s	1516.2	 So what was the line from democracy dies to applause?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1519.2s	1519.2	 Exactly. That's exactly that was Padme's line in the Star Wars films. All right. They're aging well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1524.0s	1524.0	 the prequels. Three members of San Francisco's Board of Education were-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1527.4s	1527.4	 They were the worst, just to be clear. But go on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1530.4s	1530.4	 Not compared to the three just huge dumps that Disney took on our childhoods with the sequels.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1537.0s	1537.0	 Three members of the San Francisco Board of Education were called this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1540.9s	1540.9	 Massively they lost by between 72% and 79%. These were the virtue signaling maniacs who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1550.1s	1550.1	 wanted to change the names of all the schools wouldn't reopen the schools, yada yada. And this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1555.6s	1555.6	 really frustrated and they wanted to get rid of elite AP classes. All of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1561.0s	1561.0	 They did, Jason. They did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1562.6s	1562.6	 They did. Yeah. And these three board members are out. So London Breed-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1567.5s	1567.5	 In the middle of a pandemic, I think my understanding is that instead of figuring out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1573.7s	1573.7	 how to get these kids back in class, how to figure out how they could take off their masks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1578.6s	1578.6	 they wanted to drop Abraham Lincoln and George Washington's name from schools because it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1583.2s	1583.2	 too regressive. They canceled the gifted program because it made other kids feel bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1589.1s	1589.1	 And a gentleman that wanted to serve on a committee who I think was gay, but not minority,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1594.9s	1594.9	 was excluded because he wasn't a minority enough for them. So these are the three people that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1603.6s	1603.6	 76% of San Francisco citizens or residents just recalled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1608.6s	1608.6	 And if you're not following this, the tech industry had a major part in this in terms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1612.9s	1612.9	 of backing it. There was a lot of claims, which I'll let Sachs address in a moment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1617.2s	1617.2	 that this was a Republican-driven out-of-state movement. But if you look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1622.5s	1622.5	 there are not 100,000 Republicans in San Francisco in all likelihood. This was actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1628.1s	1628.1	 parents in a lot of cases based on the geography of San Francisco and the density of certain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1633.4s	1633.4	 populations. A lot of Asian Americans came out in force in some neighborhoods. 90%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1638.5s	1638.5	 were voting to oust these people. Gary Tan, who is a product of the San
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1643.1s	1643.1	 Francisco public education system and a great entrepreneur and venture capitalist,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1647.6s	1647.6	 was a leader in this movement. So congratulations to him. And this all is going to culminate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1651.6s	1651.6	 I think, in May or June. Sachs will correct me with the recall effort for Chesa Boudin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1658.1s	1658.1	 this killer DA who won't prosecute anybody. Sachs, what are your thoughts on this victory?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1662.1s	1662.1	 And full disclosure, you were a major donor to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1664.5s	1664.5	 I was the second largest donor and I was the largest donor under age 90. Arthur Rock was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1669.0s	1669.0	 biggest donor. What a badass, by the way. The guy is 95 years old. He donated $400,000 to this recall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1676.7s	1676.7	 In fairness, you live in San Francisco. This is a backdoor issue for you. You care about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1680.6s	1680.6	 Yeah. Look, I think crime in schools are the key quality of life issues in any community and it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1686.2s	1686.2	 transcends partisan boundaries. If your kids cannot get a quality education and you cannot be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1691.9s	1691.9	 safe in your community, nothing else matters. And that matters to Democrats just as much as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1696.4s	1696.4	 Republicans. And that's why, like you said, three quarters of San Francisco voted for this recall,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1701.1s	1701.1	 even though 85% of them voted for Biden. It's basically a 90% Democrat city. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1707.4s	1707.4	 all these claims that was a Republican recall turned out to be nonsense. This was something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1711.2s	1711.2	 that was broadly supported. And look, it's the same reason that Yonkin flipped a plus 10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1719.1s	1719.1	 Democrat state in Virginia, which is that it had a lot to do with school closures. They kept the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1725.6s	1725.6	 schools closed for a year and a half. And then when they were supposed to have a PTA meeting about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1732.4s	1732.4	 reopening it, like Jamal said, they spent five hours debating whether to allow this beloved gay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1738.2s	1738.2	 parent onto a voluntary school board. They didn't. They spent all their time talking about changing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1743.3s	1743.3	 the names of the schools instead of how to reopen them. They also, there's chronic mismanagement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1747.7s	1747.7	 The school is something like $125 million in debt, despite being in a very rich city.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1753.4s	1753.4	 They opened for one day, just so that they could get a state piece of the state budget pie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1759.3s	1759.3	 So these kids clamored back to school just so that they could technically say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1763.1s	1763.1	 yeah, we were open. And to get, I think it was a 12 or $13 million check,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1767.1s	1767.1	 and then they shut the schools down again. Right. And you brought up a key point, Jason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1770.5s	1770.5	 which is that the Asian American community in San Francisco has been absolutely galvanized by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1774.3s	1774.3	 this issue because the school board also, you know, Lowell High School is one of the best schools in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1779.0s	1779.0	 the city and it was merit based and it had great advanced math programs. And this board basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1784.4s	1784.4	 got rid of all of that stuff and then infuriated the Asian American community, many of whose most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1789.8s	1789.8	 prominent members have basically risen out of poverty because of the education they got at Lowell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1795.7s	1795.7	 And so this war on merit that's happening is something that is going to flip the Asian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1803.9s	1803.9	 American community, I think, to... When I was growing up, I grew up in a French ghetto of Ottawa
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1812.9s	1812.9	 and I was supposed to go to a local high school that was just plainly trash. And I was able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1820.3s	1820.3	 go to an equivalent of Lowell, this public magnet high school that had advanced classes and everything,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1827.8s	1827.8	 a gifted program. And it really did change my life. And so I really understand what people are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1834.3s	1834.3	 saying, which is like when you're in poverty, the only way out is through an education, really. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1840.4s	1840.4	 may get accidentally lucky, but the only really predictable, sustainable pattern here is through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1846.6s	1846.6	 school. And so when you deprive folks from being able to get a decent education, and there's no real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1853.5s	1853.5	 orderly logic to it, it's a really ridiculous kind of an idea. The other thing is I think that this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1859.0s	1859.0	 speaks very powerfully, as Sac said, as a non, as a bipartisan issue that these Democrats have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1865.7s	1865.7	 get right. Because you saw this also in Virginia, where Democrats basically went down this one tack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1874.8s	1874.8	 and the Republican candidate, Glenn Youngkin, basically said, hey, listen, the schools are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1879.5s	1879.5	 broken. It's completely doesn't make any sense. We oppose a lot of what's going on the watering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1884.4s	1884.4	 down and the critical race theory, etc, etc. And he put it to a vote. And a lot of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1888.8s	1888.8	 cross the aisle there as well, where typically, our Democrats basically voted for their Republican
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1893.9s	1893.9	 governor. I think the point is that there are just several issues that are just so transcend,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1900.1s	1900.1	 like they're just they transcend all party lines. And this is an anchor issue that we have to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1905.2s	1905.2	 right. Friedberg, any thoughts on this? Do you think this is the start of maybe a turnaround
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1911.1s	1911.1	 for San Francisco? Because Chesapeake is way more hated. And safety is an even bigger issue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1917.8s	1917.8	 I think, for a lot of people right now in San Francisco. And it dovetails with Asian hate and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1923.0s	1923.0	 the number of Asian people targeted in crimes. So he's got a I mean, if these people got out by 75%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1929.4s	1929.4	 on average, he's going to be out by 95%. Is this a tipping point? Is San Francisco going to make a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1933.6s	1933.6	 rebound? I don't know. I think there's generally a broader
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1939.4s	1939.4	 trend and momentum around what we classify as wokeism, which I think is a little bit disparaging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1945.8s	1945.8	 to the intention of social justice and recognizing the primary points of social justice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1953.5s	1953.5	 through action and behavior in civic discourse and in government behavior. And you know, this like the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1962.0s	1962.0	 election of several DAs around the country, who take a different stance to prosecution of crime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1969.4s	1969.4	 to try and create better options for rehab and so on, I think is not a movement that's going to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1975.3s	1975.3	 away overnight. I think there's certainly a hefty amount of resistance. But what we're really doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1981.1s	1981.1	 right now is I think we're learning and realizing the boundaries of this movement and of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1986.6s	1986.6	 moment. The one boundary that I think San Franciscans are too bad. San Francisco, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1992.2s	1992.2	 you know, as in the case in tech has always been so progressive in terms of, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=1996.6s	1996.6	 doing these things faster than anyone else. But what we're realizing in San Francisco is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2000.9s	2000.9	 non prosecution of criminals, as the DA has undertaken over the past couple of years leads to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2007.0s	2007.0	 really heinous crime and rampant crime. And, and this kind of social justice movement within the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2013.8s	2013.8	 education system causes a decline in the value of our education system. Those are two really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2018.8s	2018.8	 important learnings that San Francisco has had over the past couple of years with this very important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2025.2s	2025.2	 and momentous kind of social justice movement. But it doesn't mean that the movement is over,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2029.7s	2029.7	 it doesn't mean that quote unquote woke ism is over. It means that that social justice intent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2034.1s	2034.1	 is still there. But we're realizing where the boundaries are and how far things can and maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2037.9s	2037.9	 should go. I posted this article, Tyler Collin, who's a you know, pretty well known economist,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2043.1s	2043.1	 he wrote this op ed for the for Bloomberg. And what he said is that woke ism has peaked. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2049.5s	2049.5	 there's just these two passages that builds on what Friedberg said, quote, by woke ism,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2055.2s	2055.2	 I refer to a movement that on the positive side is highly aware of racism and social injustice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2060.4s	2060.4	 and is galvanized towards raising awareness. On the negative side, it can be preachy alienating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2066.2s	2066.2	 overly concerned with symbols and self righteous, unquote. And I think that that probably does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2071.8s	2071.8	 summarize sort of like where it starts, which is I think rooted in a very good place. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2076.2s	2076.2	 unfortunately, all too often where it ends, which is that sort of moral absolutist judgment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2082.5s	2082.5	 cancel culture around it. And then the second quote that he said was the following, he said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2087.9s	2087.9	 quote, woke ism is likely to evolve into a subculture that is highly educated, highly white,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2094.4s	2094.4	 and fairly feminine. That is still a large mass of people, but not enough to run the country or all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2100.2s	2100.2	 its major institutions. In the San Francisco School Board recall, for instance, the role of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2104.6s	2104.6	 Asian Americans was especially prominent, unquote. So I don't know, I just think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2110.9s	2110.9	 all these things sort of, you know, people are looking for affiliation. And you start with labels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2116.4s	2116.4	 that bring you in and then you have to sort out are all these labels really true? And how true are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2121.8s	2121.8	 they? And I think we're in this moment now where we know the mechanism of action of woke ism,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2126.7s	2126.7	 I just don't think it works anymore. And I think a lot of people will say, I believe in the high
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2130.5s	2130.5	 order of deals of racial and social justice, but I don't believe in the mechanism of action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2134.3s	2134.3	 And so the pendulum swung too far. But but but but the core intent of a generation of change is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2140.2s	2140.2	 underway, which is social justice and climate change. I think those are the two big points of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2145.4s	2145.4	 concern be done with this cohort under this. Well, it will be done to this extreme this fast, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2151.0s	2151.0	 And I think that the pendulum went too fast, too far. And it's and there are boundary effects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2157.7s	2157.7	 that are causing recourse right now. And we're seeing this across the country, especially in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2161.2s	2161.2	 New York with the election of the mayor and San Francisco, the DA recalls happening in the next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2165.5s	2165.5	 couple of months. So, Saks, what's your prediction on the DA recall, by the way?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2168.9s	2168.9	 Well, that's 95%. But I mean, to build on your point, they were talking about 10% of the people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2174.2s	2174.2	 in the United States who are involved in this, you know, retweeting and virtual signaling and,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2179.1s	2179.1	 you know, is Twitter a real place? Well, no, a city is a real place, people have to live in San
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2183.3s	2183.3	 Francisco. And when these ideologies result in unlivable conditions for people, well, they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2189.5s	2189.5	 going to say, you know, there's reality here, how do we get competent people to take the positions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2195.8s	2195.8	 sacks that are being vacated? Now, who should London breed put in these three positions? And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2202.1s	2202.1	 maybe tech people need to I mean, this is what I think has to happen. I think some number of tech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2205.9s	2205.9	 people have to get off the bench and say, you know what, I'm going to do a tour of duty as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2210.6s	2210.6	 politicians in San Francisco, to take back the city, what should happen here in terms of who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2215.9s	2215.9	 takes these positions, because Republicans can't win in San Francisco. So you're going to need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2219.4s	2219.4	 moderate Democrats, right? Saks before Saks goes, can I just say something? Because I think I just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2223.6s	2223.6	 want to say something, it's really important, Saks, I'm sorry to jump in. But, J Cal, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2227.4s	2227.4	 the point you're making about the tech people implies the tech people are effective and good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2232.2s	2232.2	 at doing this. But that's not necessarily the fabric of San Francisco. I've lived in San
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2236.6s	2236.6	 Francisco since 2001. The number of people in San Francisco in 2001 that were in the tech industry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2241.4s	2241.4	 was a minority. Since that time, it became a significant size. And over the last two years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2245.9s	2245.9	 since the pandemic, it's decreased significantly. But San Francisco is a city with decades and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2250.0s	2250.0	 generations of history. My wife's family is multi generational San Franciscans. And I don't think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2255.1s	2255.1	 that traditionally San Franciscans view tech people as the right people to solve these problems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2260.8s	2260.8	 for them. That the intention of that city is not necessarily about let's get tech people to solve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2265.0s	2265.0	 our problems. They have a different set of values, perhaps. And so we often overstate and assume that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2270.2s	2270.2	 tech people are the right people and are the problem solvers. But I don't think that that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2275.4s	2275.4	 necessarily the right problems that people want to solve. So I just wanted to intervene.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2278.4s	2278.4	 Well, then who should take these positions? Because it's typically really far left people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2283.9s	2283.9	 are motivated to take these positions. I don't see business people writ large across all political
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2289.8s	2289.8	 positions, but specifically in San Francisco don't want to take these positions. So is this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2292.9s	2292.9	 just going to be replayed? The recall effort was led by two parents, Autumn illusion and Siva Raj.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2299.2s	2299.2	 They're the ones who led this thing. They're the ones who rose up to basically oppose these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2303.7s	2303.7	 crazy school board members. And that is who London Bridge should talk to. I mean, she needs to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2308.8s	2308.8	 talk to the people who are successful in organizing this recall, because they understand the issues,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2313.8s	2313.8	 obviously, and the people are with them. So either appoint them to the board or ask them for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2318.6s	2318.6	 recommendations. And I think what you see consistently, whether it's with this SF
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2323.8s	2323.8	 school board or the the school boards that we saw in Virginia, that young can very effectively ran
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2330.0s	2330.0	 against is that they don't believe the parents matter. Terry McCallis fatal, his last gap was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2336.4s	2336.4	 basically saying that the parents shouldn't get to decide what is taught in the schools. He basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2340.5s	2340.5	 said the quiet part out loud. But that is what still across the country, the teachers unions believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2346.4s	2346.4	 and most of the Democratic Party, the activists believe. And until they start losing elections,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2351.0s	2351.0	 you're not going to see a change in that belief. Oh, my God, how awesome would it be if sacks were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2355.4s	2355.4	 on the school board? Oh, my God. Yeah. And just to put a pin in this, and the cherry on top,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2363.6s	2363.6	 the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted seven to four to send a recall reform bill. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2369.8s	2369.8	 their reaction to all of this is to do a recall of recalls and say now you can't recall somebody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2377.7s	2377.7	 in their first year and the people who are placed in these positions can't run again. So now the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2381.4s	2381.4	 speculation is that three people who got voted off are going to run again. So there's a lot more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2386.3s	2386.3	 to come on this. Yeah. And also part so they're putting this to staff that they're putting that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2391.0s	2391.0	 on the ballot on June 7, the same day that we vote on the recall of Jason Boudin, the board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2395.4s	2395.4	 supervisor now put in this measure that would make it far harder to recall people. One of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2400.0s	2400.0	 provisions of that is whoever London breed appoints as the successor, like you're talking about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2406.2s	2406.2	 they cannot run after that. So it is designed to for no, that makes no sense. They're basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2411.9s	2411.9	 trying to do a great job. Right? Exactly. It makes no sense. So you have the Board of Supervisors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2416.9s	2416.9	 trying to throw a wrench into the democratic process. Meanwhile, these are people who claim
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2421.3s	2421.3	 to be preserving democracy, saving democracy, they're trying to throw a wrench in the thing is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2427.0s	2427.0	 underlying it, David, is they think they know better. That's what it fundamentally comes down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2431.8s	2431.8	 to, they are willing to have democracy up to a point. And when that point is an unacceptable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2437.0s	2437.0	 view by somebody else, they feel like they know better. And they're willing to be really draconian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2442.1s	2442.1	 in whatever they do to decide. Yeah. And shout out to Mike Bloomberg, I'll pull up the tweet for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2448.4s	2448.4	 everybody. He hasn't been very vocal or been on the stage much, but obviously he did a great job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2453.5s	2453.5	 in New York on reforming schools. The San Francisco school board recall should be a wake up call to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2460.1s	2460.1	 elected officials, especially Democrats across the nation. Parents are fed up with the status quo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2464.6s	2464.6	 And that put adults that puts adults ahead of kids. Yeah. Well, ideology ahead of results. Well said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2470.9s	2470.9	 Mike. Yeah, well said, Mr. Bloomberg. Yes, that was very good. And Bloomberg has been very good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2475.7s	2475.7	 on calling out the Democrat, their Democratic party is blind little to the teachers unions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2480.8s	2480.8	 And until they're willing to break with the teachers unions who are their biggest donor,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2485.4s	2485.4	 we're not going to get any real progress on school reform. And this is the issue. My favorite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2490.1s	2490.1	 political commentator, one of them is Roy Tishara, who's a Democrat, he wrote the emerging Democrat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2494.3s	2494.3	 majority. He wrote a blog post talking about how the Asian American voters are going to swing away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2500.2s	2500.2	 from the Democratic party because of issues like this, because of the decline of standards in school.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2505.5s	2505.5	 And safety and the Asian American community, I think is galvanized on this chase of routine issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2510.3s	2510.3	 because they have seen in all these cases of Asian hate, where elders in their community have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2515.8s	2515.8	 been violently assaulted. Chase of routine has done nothing except release the perpetrators.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2520.8s	2520.8	 Bonkers. All right. Well, listen, this is seems like a good turning point. Let's we talked about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2525.3s	2525.3	 on this podcast over and over again, about the compression in SAS multiples in the public market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2531.6s	2531.6	 valuations, something that we're still working through in the stock market, which has been choppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2537.0s	2537.0	 at best over the last couple of months, an information story came out just this week,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2541.3s	2541.3	 major crossover funds like Tiger and D1 are slowing down their investments in late stage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2546.0s	2546.0	 private companies. And I was talking to some folks who said the multiple compression is here now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2551.0s	2551.0	 They're not doing the deals that 75 or 100 x revenue. This is reported in an article by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2556.5s	2556.5	 the information Tiger Global told their LPs in a webinar earlier this month that it would no longer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2562.0s	2562.0	 focus on backing late stage startups preparing to go public instead they will focus on two things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2567.8s	2567.8	 going even earlier into series A and series B rounds and buying shares of public tech companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2573.2s	2573.2	 that have sunk in value compared to the all time highs. Obviously, we know Twillow Zoom block
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2578.8s	2578.8	 all down over 60% from their one year highs, I could get into more details here. But let's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2583.6s	2583.6	 stop for a second and Chamath, what are your thoughts? In the dot com bubble,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2589.0s	2589.0	 it took somewhere between three to five years for most stocks to bottom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2593.4s	2593.4	 And they bottomed, I think, peak to trough somewhere, you know, towards 80% of where they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2600.1s	2600.1	 were in 2000, right? So it took three to five years to go basically minus 80%. We did that in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2607.4s	2607.4	 three months, you know, maybe four months. And so the markets have become a lot more efficient
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2614.1s	2614.1	 over time. So now that we have that reset, it's pretty natural that there's going to be a very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2619.8s	2619.8	 quick reset on the private market side. And you know, you have to go where the bodies are buried.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2625.5s	2625.5	 And what I mean by that in this case is that overwhelming misvaluation of late stage private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2632.4s	2632.4	 companies. And so these folks don't have much of a choice. They have a lot of money that they've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2638.1s	2638.1	 raised before all of this happened. They have a huge portfolio of stuff that they've marked up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2644.6s	2644.6	 or have been marked up by others. And they don't want to go through the pain now resetting. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2651.2s	2651.2	 part of the easy strategic decision there is to say, you know what, we know this is a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2656.1s	2656.1	 radioactive. But instead of really figuring out what the mark on these companies are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2661.5s	2661.5	 we'll go to a different sort of part of the playground and play there. Because we don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2667.5s	2667.5	 have to go and deal with these issues. And, you know, we can do 10, 15, $20 million checks into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2672.9s	2672.9	 early stage businesses, pretty normal reaction strategically. But I think the reality is that at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2679.0s	2679.0	 some point in the next year or two, these other companies have to get public, the hope is that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2683.8s	2683.8	 market catches back up so that you can defend the last valuation. And that's the that's the way that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2689.8s	2689.8	 this stuff doesn't require a lot of pain. The problem is if you're high burn, and you were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2695.6s	2695.6	 counting on yet another successive round, or you're at a point in your lifecycle where you need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2700.7s	2700.7	 go public in the next two years, if you go public, you will get taken to the woodshed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2705.9s	2705.9	 Take you to the woodshed being your valuation might be half of what it is in your last round.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2731.0s	2731.0	 I mean, I saw what you did to ICQ, man, you were riding that bad boy down. That wasn't

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2777.9s	2777.9	 talking about number two, COOs, not CEOs, just for the CEO position. To be clear, I'm not talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2783.0s	2783.0	 CEO, I'm talking COO. I would say Tim Cook, when he was Steve Jobs, that's my number one operator
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2789.0s	2789.0	 last 23 years. Number two, I put Cheryl Sandberg, who did obviously amazing things for Google, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2794.5s	2794.5	 then Facebook, right? Those two would be my top two. And then I tie my top two, Sachs, as a PayPal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2802.4s	2802.4	 and Zenefits, even though it didn't work out, it was still a great run at the time. And then I put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2806.6s	2806.6	 Keith Raboy, Square, and a couple of other companies he did. Those are my top four. Anybody else want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2812.7s	2812.7	 to come at me? Go ahead. I don't have complete data set on COOs. But where would you put Sachs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2817.6s	2817.6	 You did I put you disagree. Who am I to disagree?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2820.8s	2820.8	 I'm not sure.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2829.8s	2829.8	 There we go. There we go. They're back together.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2843.6s	2843.6	 there. No one's asking you. Stay in your lane, free bird. So Sachs, as an operator extraordinaire,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2848.4s	2848.4	 what's your best advice to the company that raised 100 million? And let's say their valuation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2852.6s	2852.6	 is now not a billion, it's 500 million. What are the steps you take? You got 14 months of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2856.7s	2856.7	 runway in the bank. Do you lay people out? Do you extend it to 24? What are your thoughts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2861.4s	2861.4	 Okay, you must be dealing with this with companies in your portfolio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2864.6s	2864.6	 Well, there's a few things going on. First of all, I think Tiger built a great business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2868.1s	2868.1	 in providing late stage sort of passive non dilutive capital to companies, SaaS companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2874.3s	2874.3	 we have a bunch of SaaS businesses that they provided later stage financing. I think those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2880.2s	2880.2	 valuations are going to come down. I don't know that they're going to be such a great partner for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2883.8s	2883.8	 series A firms because they are passive. And, you know, we see is that series A companies need a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2889.0s	2889.0	 lot of help. They need a lot of advice. You need a lot of help with recruiting governance, governance,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2893.4s	2893.4	 they need, you know, when they're growing from, say, 20 employees to 100, they need to know what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2897.4s	2897.4	 that org chart looks like, and on and on and on. So I don't know that if this report, I don't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2902.2s	2902.2	 if this reporting is actually true. But if the goal is all of a sudden for Tiger to become a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2906.5s	2906.5	 series A investor that competes with craft or Sequoia or these other firms that are not very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2911.4s	2911.4	 hands on, that doesn't seem like a great strategy to me. I do think that for our later stage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2916.2s	2916.2	 companies, they have to realize that, you know, if they raise the other side of this, all right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2921.3s	2921.3	 David, I just want your reaction to this. I think it's going to work, but not for the right reasons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2927.4s	2927.4	 The reason it'll work is there are way more entrepreneurs now than there are great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2932.2s	2932.2	 entrepreneurs. And so of all of these entrepreneurs that exist, the idea of getting passive money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2940.0s	2940.0	 where you won't get fired, where there is that remember, like, remember, when we were growing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2944.4s	2944.4	 up in Silicon Valley, the risk is always like, if you take Sequoia benchmark, you know, social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2950.2s	2950.2	 capital, like there's a high bar for that capital, which means we are helping you run this business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2954.9s	2954.9	 effectively. And there's a cost where if you don't perform, you'll get fired. There's always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2959.4s	2959.4	 been that risk. It's true. And I guess that's the argument they could make. But the flip side is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2963.4s	2963.4	 that there's a lot of these. So the CEO now, why would you take a $15 million series A check from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2969.0s	2969.0	 Sequoia where they could fire you? Whereas $15 million from Tiger, they'll may never call you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2973.9s	2973.9	 We address that by doing look, if a founder is really worried about that, we address that by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2978.1s	2978.1	 giving them three board seats, you know, we might have one, they might have three. I mean, my view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2983.0s	2983.0	 on it is you just never fire a founder unless he does something criminal. It's just that simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2987.4s	2987.4	 But so look, I think there's ways of addressing the governance where you can get the help or the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2993.9s	2993.9	 value out of an early stage firm without giving up the control. So yeah, I mean, look, that's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=2999.6s	2999.6	 pitch that Tiger would make. But I think that's addressable. What do you think of that pitch for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3003.8s	3003.8	 you Berg, we'll give you the $15 million series A, you don't have to have a board, you can just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3009.6s	3009.6	 be passive and let us know how it goes. Give us a quarterly report. We'll look at the P&L.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3014.1s	3014.1	 That's all of crypto now anyways. That's true. Well, I mean, that's a fair point. No governance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3017.8s	3017.8	 in crypto is leading to a lot of weird stuff. I can tell you. I tell people this a lot. So I had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3022.7s	3022.7	 three term sheets for my series B. It was from Andreessen Horowitz, KOSLA Ventures and Founders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3028.5s	3028.5	 Fund and Founders Fund came in kind of last minute. But I went with KOSLA, even though it was a lower
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3035.0s	3035.0	 valuation because Vinod was pretty insistent, like, let me put someone that could be useful,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3039.6s	3039.6	 some, you know, government person, because we're doing a lot of work lobbying in DC,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3044.4s	3044.4	 on your board, we won't be on your board, we won't bother you. And I took the round and then my series
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3048.5s	3048.5	 C I took from Founders Fund because Brian Singerman, who's obviously a good friend,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3053.0s	3053.0	 you know, made the case like, look, our model at Founders Fund is we let founders run the business,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3057.6s	3057.6	 we're not here to tell you how to run your business. And they were both great fits. And,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3061.0s	3061.0	 you know, it worked out well. I didn't I had, I have had experience with antagonistic VCs on boards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3067.5s	3067.5	 And, you know, it generally creates a pretty negative dynamic. Now, what's the worst story
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3071.7s	3071.7	 without the person's name? I don't think I want to go public with it. So I'm not going to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3075.6s	3075.6	 But when I was on give us an idea of what the behavior would be, because there are people in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3079.0s	3079.0	 the audience who want to know what is bad behavior of VC, just give us a composite when you're an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3082.5s	3082.5	 entrepreneur or CEO running an early stage business, you live that business 20 hours a day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3087.8s	3087.8	 you know, the details, if you're smart, you're thorough, you're analytical, you're creative,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3092.7s	3092.7	 there is no one that's going to come in the boardroom for two hours a quarter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3096.2s	3096.2	 and suggest things to you that you haven't thought of, there's no one that's going to come in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3099.6s	3099.6	 room and be smarter than you at your own business. And so more often than not, Vinod has been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3103.9s	3103.9	 exceptional at defining this problem. The problem is VCs think join a board, and they think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3109.3s	3109.3	 they have to quote, add value. So they come in and they make a bunch of suggestions and recommendations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3113.9s	3113.9	 and push you to do a bunch of things. And as Vinod has said correctly, many times, they more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3118.6s	3118.6	 often than not add negative value, they can actually destroy and damage a business, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3123.2s	3123.2	 they need to feel like they're exerting some degree of influence over the business. And as a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3127.0s	3127.0	 result, they push the business to do things that the CEO or founder otherwise wouldn't be doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3131.5s	3131.5	 And that often ends up in a kind of weird sticky kind of place. So I just validated the tiger pitch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3136.0s	3136.0	 right there. I think that's right. And by the way, it's why founders fund founders fund is fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3141.0s	3141.0	 I don't know if you guys are LPs, but their investment returns are so far beyond what I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3145.8s	3145.8	 think anyone really realizes they're incredible investors. And a big part of it is they try and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3149.8s	3149.8	 find the entrepreneur that doesn't want and doesn't need the help. And then they give them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3153.6s	3153.6	 the capital to go and execute and they leave them the heck alone. And they are just so good at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3157.4s	3157.4	 finding those folks, identifying them and then literally being passive in how they kind of manage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3163.1s	3163.1	 and operate their business. And that's why they were so frigging good. I think the people you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3166.6s	3166.6	 talking about are a lot of rookie VCs who come in and then Yeah, they think they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3170.6s	3170.6	 not just just experienced ex operators even people who ran businesses who say I know how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3175.4s	3175.4	 to run a business and look no two businesses are alike. So maybe the way they ran their business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3179.6s	3179.6	 with their team and their market and their industry worked well for them. But now when they got to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3183.3s	3183.3	 come in and do it with someone else's business and some other space with some completely different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3187.3s	3187.3	 team, you know, they try and exert influence and really it's just, you know, not wanted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3191.7s	3191.7	 Let me go to sac sacs. Hold on, I want to just get one from you. Give us an idea because you've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3196.0s	3196.0	 been in the business for over 20 years. I mean, by the looks of it, maybe 40 but 20 years just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3202.3s	3202.3	 crushing it in the business. What's the worst behavior you've seen on a board?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3207.2s	3207.2	 You can make a composite of like a VC to being destructive on a board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3211.9s	3211.9	 Yeah, I mean, look, I think sometimes VCs will have sort of hobby horses and they'll keep pushing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3216.8s	3216.8	 for things that the founder doesn't want. That's not productive. But what I would say is, first of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3223.5s	3223.5	 all, let me just say like, I'm not somebody who likes to take board seats and I do it as I see it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3230.4s	3230.4	 as a cost, not a benefit to me, because it takes up my time. If I didn't have to ever take a board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3235.1s	3235.1	 seat, that'd be a great as far as I'm concerned, that'd be a good thing. I'm not somebody who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3239.5s	3239.5	 wants to, you know, insert myself and get on these boards, you know, offered as an incentive. No,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3244.6s	3244.6	 I only I only took a board seat. The only reason I'll ever take a board seat is because I have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3249.7s	3249.7	 do it because the founder insists that otherwise they won't go with I've seen it with us. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3253.4s	3253.4	 exactly. So you'll do it for one year, right? You'll say, Hey, I'll do it for a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3256.7s	3256.7	 I always time limit it now because I just can't. I mean, I can't make a 10 year obligation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3261.4s	3261.4	 you know, it's typically like one or two years and then, you know, we'll see. It doesn't mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3265.0s	3265.0	 I'll roll off in two years, but but I but I need to have the expectation set up. And the reality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3271.6s	3271.6	 is if the company can perform well for another two years, they'll be at a different stage and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3276.8s	3276.8	 maybe they won't, you know, need my help as much so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3279.4s	3279.4	 Chamath, the two most valuable pieces of private equity that I own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3285.4s	3285.4	 is a company called DCG. And it's a company called Netscope. And collectively, it's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3291.1s	3291.1	 $1 billion worth of stock that I own what I'm on the board of one. I'm not on the board of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3296.2s	3296.2	 the other anymore. And I text with these guys maybe once every two or three months at best.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3302.5s	3302.5	 So, you know, completely confirming David, your point that great founders are just n of one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3307.4s	3307.4	 individuals, you know, Barry Silbert, Sanjay Berry, next level guys. But that's very different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3316.4s	3316.4	 than the the series a playbook because when I ran institutional money, I'm telling you there is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3321.1s	3321.1	 pressure to be involved and show some value. And I do think that there is a level of judgment on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3328.0s	3328.0	 the CEO that has happened. Now, maybe that's changed historically. But I think that's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3333.0s	3333.0	 single biggest pivot that one would exploit if you were Tiger or Co2 or D1 stepping into the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3339.0s	3339.0	 early stage game, which is to essentially make it a feature. And it's not dissimilar to when DST and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3344.7s	3344.7	 Uri Milner entered the late stage round. You know, what was his big differentiation? I'll take common
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3350.4s	3350.4	 stock and I won't take a board seat. I do not need a board seat to be influential. It seems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3355.0s	3355.0	 so counterintuitive and so against the grain. But he acknowledged what was this thing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3362.1s	3362.1	 up until that point was true, which is common and preferred converged in price per share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3367.5s	3367.5	 So buying common in a late stage company was the same as buying preferred.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3371.8s	3371.8	 You know, that's something you should explain at your mouth for a second. People don't know this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3375.1s	3375.1	 but add an IPO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3377.6s	3377.6	 So when you set up a company, you have a price per share of the common stock and then a price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3381.8s	3381.8	 per share that the series A investor has. The series A investor is buying preferred shares
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3387.0s	3387.0	 that actually looks more like debt than equity. And what I mean by that is there's typically a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3391.5s	3391.5	 coupon, there's a rate of return, there's accumulated dividends, all these features
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3397.4s	3397.4	 give it a certain price per share and the common has none of those features.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3400.6s	3400.6	 And so it has a lower price per share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3403.6s	3403.6	 And that gap is typically around 20 to one when you set up a company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3408.4s	3408.4	 And that's what allows you to hire employees and give them very, very cheap options with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3413.0s	3413.0	 embedded upside. Then what happens is you raise more and more of these series B, series C, series
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3418.6s	3418.6	 D, these preference stack, preferred shares build up. But the value of the common keeps rising too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3424.2s	3424.2	 And by the time you go public, the gap converges. What Uri realized was, hey, wait a minute, I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3430.4s	3430.4	 buying a company a year or 18 months before it goes public, the price of the common and the price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3435.0s	3435.0	 of the preferred are roughly the same. And so I'm just gonna, you know, do that. And I'm not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3439.9s	3439.9	 gonna take a board seat because it's clear this company is successful. So similarly, for Tiger D1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3444.4s	3444.4	 and Coat 2, I would just observe the obvious and kind of put everything that we've just said on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3449.4s	3449.4	 table, which is, hey, guys, I'll give you the money, you're either end of one or not. I'm making a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3454.5s	3454.5	 guess that you are and I'm just going to get out of your way and leave you alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3457.4s	3457.4	 So unbundling governance and unbundling the governance and advice piece from the capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3462.2s	3462.2	 piece, but you can still need that governance and advice piece, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3464.7s	3464.7	 I think it could work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3465.5s	3465.5	 Yeah. I mean, I think there's a lot of great founders or they're founders who start young
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3469.4s	3469.4	 and experience become great. And the smart ones listen to advice on the way and they seek out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3474.8s	3474.8	 people who've done it before. And so, you know, yes, they may be an end of one business by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3480.4s	3480.4	 growth stage, but that doesn't mean they don't need any help whatsoever at the series A stage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3484.6s	3484.6	 Such a good observation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3485.5s	3485.5	 Yeah. And look, I think there's been, I think there's been an evolution in Silicon Valley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3488.9s	3488.9	 I'd actually say there's been like three distinct phases in the venture capital world. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3492.5s	3492.5	 remember all of them. So you go back to the late 90s, okay, when you had this mentality on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3498.8s	3498.8	 part of VCs that if a company became successful, you would just automatically replace the founders,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3503.6s	3503.6	 right? You'd go bring in a professional CEO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3505.2s	3505.2	 Upgrade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3505.7s	3505.7	 That was a disaster. Okay. And that's when Founders Fund, Peter came in, I think, Founders Fund in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3511.8s	3511.8	 2003. And the reason they called it Founders Fund is to indicate they were going to be pro-founder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3516.6s	3516.6	 and they would never replace the founder and they would let you do whatever you wanted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3520.2s	3520.2	 And I think exactly what I want to tell the backstory of the Sean Parker stuff and how that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3523.6s	3523.6	 happened. Yeah. I mean, so basically both Peter and Sean Parker had, you know, experiences they

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3534.1s	3534.1	 Roll off through work with us at PayPal is there. And I think they've evolved as a firm. So I'm not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3538.9s	3538.9	 calling them out or anything, but both Sean Parker and Peter felt like Sequoia pushed out and replaced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3546.2s	3546.2	 With Plaxo specifically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3548.3s	3548.3	 There were a couple of different companies involved, but when Peter was CEO of PayPal as well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3552.6s	3552.6	 that, you know, he felt that pressure as well. So when they then founded as two of the four
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3557.9s	3557.9	 founding partners of Founders Fund back in 2003, the whole point was we are going to be pro-founder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3563.4s	3563.4	 You're never going to replace you. We'll let you do whatever you want. I think that was phase two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3567.4s	3567.4	 And that became, I think, the dominant model. And so becoming pro-founder was now table stakes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3572.4s	3572.4	 And I think the third phase has been, you know, what Andreessen Harwits has now done with this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3577.4s	3577.4	 massive, like the services and the value add, which is that we're going to basically not only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3582.8s	3582.8	 be pro-founder, but we're going to like bring all these resources to help you. And that's the era
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3588.2s	3588.2	 we're in right now. I mean, from our perspective, like as craft, I mean, look, it's not in our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3594.4s	3594.4	 interest to get into any dispute with a founder. And if we feel like our advice isn't being taken,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3599.3s	3599.3	 well, we just back off. You know, of course, we're pro-founder. Like we don't want the control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3604.1s	3604.1	 We're not control investors. And, you know, if it's becoming frictional, we'd rather just get out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3610.5s	3610.5	 the way. It's just not worth it. The underlying thing that you're not saying, though, is because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3615.0s	3615.0	 you have enough of a fund that's large enough where you can have enough bets where any of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3620.2s	3620.2	 things to the upside is a total needle mover. But anything that goes to zero doesn't actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3625.0s	3625.0	 diminish the fund or impair it meaningfully. So there is no upside to getting engaged and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3629.4s	3629.4	 really being non-anti-founder. So I think it's a part of a business model. One thing I want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3634.6s	3634.6	 tell you about Parker, Parker was single-handedly incredibly responsible for keeping Zuck in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3639.6s	3639.6	 seat when he was president of Facebook because Parker wrote, you know, this structure that really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3644.6s	3644.6	 allowed Mark to keep control. Super voting shares.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3647.2s	3647.2	 Sachs, to add on to your point, I think that there's been... So there seems to be a bifurcation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3654.1s	3654.1	 around the services model or not. But the fourth thing that seems to have happened, and you guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3658.6s	3658.6	 tell me if I'm wrong on this, but it plays into the Tiger Global story. When I got that term sheet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3665.4s	3665.4	 for my Series B at Climate Corp, Mark Andreessen, I was trying to raise like $25 to $30 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3670.6s	3670.6	 And Mark Andreessen was like, we're going to give you a term sheet for $40 million,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3673.8s	3673.8	 more than you were asking for. Because we want you to use that extra capital to go faster,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3678.3s	3678.3	 to go harder, to grab the market because we have this big belief in businesses grabbing the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3683.2s	3683.2	 And that seems to have also become a bit of a mainstay, but not just a mainstay, but now almost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3687.4s	3687.4	 like the kind of standard pitch that a lot of the later stage guys are taking, which is like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3693.7s	3693.7	 here's so much capital that it helps you make the market. And then the Softbank Vision Fund kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3698.9s	3698.9	 took that to the extreme with $100 billion raise. And Tiger Global, I think last year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3703.0s	3703.0	 have publicly said they deployed about $15 billion into startups, where a startup may,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3708.1s	3708.1	 in a natural cycle, kind of evolve to needing $70 million raise or $100 million raise. And they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3712.8s	3712.8	 like writing checks for 250 or 300 and saying this extra capital gives you the ability to move faster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3717.5s	3717.5	 And the reason is, the faster a business moves, the higher the multiple they get on their revenue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3723.6s	3723.6	 So the higher the growth rate, the higher the multiple. So if you can deploy capital faster,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3727.5s	3727.5	 if we can find a business where we can pump money through you to get it out the door faster,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3731.8s	3731.8	 your multiple goes up. And Tiger's model was, let's just get the multiples up. There's multiple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3736.1s	3736.1	 expansion and growth. So we'll make money two ways when the company goes public in 18 to 24 months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3741.4s	3741.4	 Obviously, when the markets end up tanking and all those multiples compress,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3744.8s	3744.8	 no growth rate is going to solve that problem for you. But having more capital than maybe you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3750.4s	3750.4	 were thinking or asking for also seems to have become kind of attacking. I don't know if that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3754.8s	3754.8	 if you view that as kind of this fourth evolution, but that certainly wasn't the case
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3758.9s	3758.9	 20 years ago when VCs were being careful about, is it a $6 million round or an $8 million round?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3763.3s	3763.3	 What's the right amount of capital? And nowadays, it's much more about take more than you need.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3767.7s	3767.7	 I'll say there was a 3.5 in there, which is you saw a little bit of lack of governance or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3773.4s	3773.4	 superpowers on the part of like some incompetent founders or bad founders, just, you know, whether
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3778.6s	3778.6	 it's WeWork, Theranos, whatever, too much control, not enough governance, things go off the rail. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3783.8s	3783.8	 based on this discussion, I really think this bifurcates when it's a first time founder versus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3788.3s	3788.3	 a second time founder and what I see because I have been doing board training for seed companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3792.3s	3792.3	 where I will just have three founders sit in on each other's first board meetings, we do one board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3798.6s	3798.6	 meeting each and I train them how board meetings works and what I experienced with Sequoia on my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3802.6s	3802.6	 board and other boards. And first time founders like the tactical stuff, how to run a board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3807.4s	3807.4	 meeting, legal HR hiring partnerships, go to market strategies, man, it is all tactical all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3814.0s	3814.0	 the time. And then when I've been on with second and third time founders, you know, they really are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3818.6s	3818.6	 like, here's all the materials, here's what I'm thinking about. What do we think strategically,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3822.9s	3822.9	 so they go from the tactical level to the strategic admission level awfully quick,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3826.4s	3826.4	 and they actually seem to enjoy having those four meetings a year. Whereas the first time founders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3830.4s	3830.4	 really need to have six to 10 a year in those in that first, you know, call it year two of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3835.4s	3835.4	 company. That's my experience. I realized in this discussion, that the market has really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3840.6s	3840.6	 meaningfully changed meaning, when I was actively investing, even in the early 2000s, or sorry, in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3846.7s	3846.7	 the in the you know, 2011 1213. There was a culture where if you underperformed, you would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3852.9s	3852.9	 get replaced. And I think David, what you just spoke about, which I guess is true, has really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3859.2s	3859.2	 changed, which is if you're running a multi multi billion dollar fund, where every check is $20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3864.2s	3864.2	 million, the upside is billions, but the downside is negative 20. There's just no point. And so you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3870.3s	3870.3	 know, Sequoia used to be known as a very, very, very tough, tough, tough place for CEOs that were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3875.8s	3875.8	 underperforming. Now they got a $9 billion fund. Now you have maybe 20 years ago. It doesn't matter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3880.6s	3880.6	 anymore. Not no, not even even 10 less than 10 years ago. I think it was I think it was known
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3885.0s	3885.0	 as a very tough demanding place. I think benchmark was known as a very tough demanding place, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3889.0s	3889.0	 the money was much more finite. Right. Benchmarks still still that case. I mean, high expectation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3895.4s	3895.4	 culture, they never they never grew their fun size. No, Jason, you're not you're not hearing me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3899.2s	3899.2	 Yeah, I am. I think what's happening is, listen, I had Sequoia on my board, and I worked at Sequoia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3903.8s	3903.8	 So there's difference between high expectations, which I think all these folks have to have,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3908.6s	3908.6	 and the willingness to replace the founder as CEO. And what I'm saying is every VC claims this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3915.1s	3915.1	 but there were a handful of VCs that had the courage to do this. I mean, famously, Mike Moritz
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3919.3s	3919.3	 and John Doar, you know, had it out with Larry at the you know, right right after this round,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3925.0s	3925.0	 like either go public, you know, get your business model or give us our money back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3928.3s	3928.3	 famously at Google. So they're not they're willing to draw a line in the sand. I think that that has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3933.4s	3933.4	 fundamentally changed at all these organizations, because the fund sizes have gone up. And the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3938.2s	3938.2	 and the mathematical reality of venture capital has changed. Something else you're missing, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3942.5s	3942.5	 is you got to remember Moritz and door were not operators. And now these companies are being run
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3947.8s	3947.8	 rule off is running Sequoia, and he's an operator and he was there. So the changing of the guard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3952.9s	3952.9	 and Mark Andreessen and Ben Horowitz were operators. So the operator class behaves very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3957.2s	3957.2	 differently than agree with you. I think that it fun. No, hold on. I think that fun size dictates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3963.9s	3963.9	 his behavior more than any singular other feature. When you're running a $9 billion fund,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3969.5s	3969.5	 you just don't sweat that changing of the CEO. And David said it really well. You just say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3973.8s	3973.8	 Okay, I'll cut our losses and move on. We don't lose. I think it's more about the culture change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3977.8s	3977.8	 in Silicon Valley of a bunch of MBA finance people who have never run a company now moving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3982.7s	3982.7	 and running companies. But you know, let's move on to the next any closing thoughts on this one?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3987.0s	3987.0	 Well, just I mean, Jason, you start to make this point that if you're a founder, and you want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3991.8s	3991.8	 eventually run a great public company, when you IPO, guess what, you're going to have governments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=3997.8s	3997.8	 And what I've seen big time, right? I mean, there's just Delaware law, there's just a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4002.7s	4002.7	 of like expectations around being a public company. And so if you don't have a board,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4009.0s	4009.0	 you know, you're not constituting one until you go public, there's going to be a massive amount
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4013.2s	4013.2	 of cleanup that you have to do. And that's what I've seen. And so you'll end up scrambling to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4018.3s	4018.3	 create a board, I think that board served so many purposes early on of giving you advice and giving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4025.0s	4025.0	 you structure of providing support, help services, you can still remain in control while getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4032.0s	4032.0	 those things. And I'm just, I'm just skeptical that like, if you form a company with completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4036.7s	4036.7	 passive VCs, you don't even serve on a board, like, you're gonna have to do a lot of cleanup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4041.7s	4041.7	 later, I'd say at a minimum. Totally. I think that that's true, too. Totally. I'm not, by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4046.2s	4046.2	 way, I'm not saying I advocate this, but I just think that the reality is that if these large
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4052.6s	4052.6	 late stage crossover firms really step into the early stage, I think they could really build a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4057.8s	4057.8	 big book of business. I do think there are a lot of founders who would love to just be given the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4063.0s	4063.0	 money and just to be left alone. I'm not saying that they think they know that it's better for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4067.6s	4067.6	 them. But on the margin, just to be able to be left alone. Now, what has changed maybe those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4072.7s	4072.7	 everybody's going to be very hands off just because all the fun sizes have exploded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4076.8s	4076.8	 So at that point, then, you know, what is the difference between Sequoia and D1? Time will tell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4081.6s	4081.6	 I just know that like, when I see a founder doing something that I think could risk the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4085.6s	4085.6	 company going off the rails, I'll say so. And then, you know, if it keeps happening,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4090.2s	4090.2	 and the situation gets worse, I'll say so again, I might mention it a third time or might not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4095.9s	4095.9	 At a certain point, I'm just like, maybe after like two times, I'm just like, they don't want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4099.6s	4099.6	 to listen to me. That's fine. It's their decision, their company, their decision,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4103.4s	4103.4	 they go off the rails, their problem, you know, we'll move on to the next one. I mean, that's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4107.1s	4107.1	 reality. Sometimes founders have to learn by doing it, like sometimes their intent and you know what,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4112.0s	4112.0	 they could be right and you could be wrong too. So it's as hard as a board member, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4117.5s	4117.5	 that's why I'm very judicious in giving advice as a board member now and I'm on a bunch of boards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4122.6s	4122.6	 and do board training. Because when Ruloff was on my board, and he still is, you know, he would ask
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4127.1s	4127.1	 great questions and he would be very thoughtful about, hey, have you thought about this? Or when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4130.8s	4130.8	 I got advice from Doug or Michael Moritz directly, you know, Doug would say, hey, well, can you share
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4136.2s	4136.2	 the two-year plan with me? And I'd say, you know, we haven't built a plan. And he said, well, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4139.0s	4139.0	 know, Jason, you know, hope is not a plan. Let's make a plan and let's discuss, you know, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4143.1s	4143.1	 milestones along here. And it was amazing to have that level of thoughtfulness around your vision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4148.4s	4148.4	 as a founder. I love, I mean, as a founder, I love getting advice. And I think you got to be really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4153.0s	4153.0	 dumb not to seek it out. I mean, I, when I was a founder, I would, even though I was sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4156.6s	4156.6	 competing with Benny Hoff, I would meet with him and I would like get amazing tidbits. Just recently,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4162.0s	4162.0	 we did, it wasn't like an official board meeting because Ruloff isn't on our board, but he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4166.2s	4166.2	 a big investor in one of my incubations, Colin. And we just did a meeting with him and, and,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4174.6s	4174.6	 and the-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4175.0s	4175.0	 Gets it in every time. Not to be confused with All-In, but yeah, not to be confused with the All-In
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4179.6s	4179.6	 trademark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4180.4s	4180.4	 It was, it was me and Axel, who's the co-founder of All-In and, and Ruloff. And we had like an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4186.6s	4186.6	 amazing meeting where we got like, I'd say amazing advice from Ruloff that like focused us. And it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4193.4s	4193.4	 wasn't that I didn't know these things, but it's just like when you're in the weeds sometimes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4197.3s	4197.3	 you don't necessarily crystallize on focus on the most important thing. And I came out of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4201.8s	4201.8	 meeting feeling like, okay, Ruloff just refocused us on the most important thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4206.7s	4206.7	 And it was immensely valuable. And you've got to be like dumb not to seek that out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4210.2s	4210.2	 no matter what stage you're at, because I seek it out today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4213.7s	4213.7	 Yeah. And think about this, David, you're in the thick of things. He's on Squares board. He's on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4219.2s	4219.2	 other boards. He's got a picture of the entire playing field. It's like somebody who's the coach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4223.9s	4223.9	 of 15 NBA teams. And you're like the coach of one. He's seeing things on other NBA teams that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4230.9s	4230.9	 they're doing in methodologies and best practices that you're just not going to see. So I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4235.5s	4235.5	 again, and then if you look at the great founders, TK used to come to me and say, hey, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4241.0s	4241.0	 this is the thing I'm going to be doing at the next board meeting, or here's the thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4243.8s	4243.8	 can we jam out? And he would just ask for a jam session. He came up with that term and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4248.0s	4248.0	 three or four people would get together and just jam and talk for five hours about the product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4251.6s	4251.6	 It was awesome. All right, let's go on to David Sachs, his favorite section of the show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4258.6s	4258.6	 Science with the Sultan of Science himself. Oh, I thought you were going to say his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4262.6s	4262.6	 friend with Paul Graham. Oh, enough with that. Oh, we can't talk about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4268.1s	4268.1	 That was exciting. You have to you if you are engaged in the science segment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4273.2s	4273.2	 David Sachs and PG are in a fight. All right, let's cover it. Here's the deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4276.8s	4276.8	 If David Sachs is engaged during the science portion of the class, we will let him have his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4281.8s	4281.8	 fight as the as the teacher here. Tell us a little bit about stem cells and this HIV story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4288.0s	4288.0	 I was going to tell Sachs that the earth is round. Okay, it's not flat. I don't care. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4293.8s	4293.8	 How does that affect Solana? So sorry, the story that I think we wanted to you guys wanted to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4299.0s	4299.0	 cover today with the HIV story, which incredible. I suggested this topic. So I'm interested. Explain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4305.5s	4305.5	 it to us. HIV is a retro virus, meaning once you get infected, it doesn't go away. He doesn't care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4314.0s	4314.0	 We better come back to PG. He's flipping through his Politico notes to figure out what did he miss
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4319.9s	4319.9	 saying that he was supposed to say today? He just flipped over to Ben Shapiro on 2XP.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4325.1s	4325.1	 He's listening to Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris in conversation. Go ahead,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4329.7s	4329.7	 Sol. The HIV being cured headline, you know, we can dive into it for two minutes, but HIV is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4335.8s	4335.8	 a retro virus. When you get infected with HIV, it stays in your body forever. It actually ends
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4340.2s	4340.2	 up living inside of your immune cells. That's what makes it such an interesting, challenging virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4345.6s	4345.6	 And it destroys those immune cells. So over time, you end up getting AIDS. And the way it enters the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4350.2s	4350.2	 immune cells is through a specific protein. Some people have a genetic mutation, where if there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4356.7s	4356.7	 a change in their DNA and that protein is different, HIV cannot enter their immune cells
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4362.3s	4362.3	 and they are naturally immune to HIV. CCR5. Yeah. And so what's happened is...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4369.7s	4369.7	 Found apparently in white Northern Europeans. Yeah, like Norwegians, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4374.6s	4374.6	 Norwegians, exactly. And anyway, so the interesting study that was done,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4381.0s	4381.0	 all immune cells are made from stem cells in your bone marrow. And so, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4386.2s	4386.2	 all the white blood cells that we have that fight off our diseases come from our bone marrow. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4391.1s	4391.1	 when you get a blood cancer, sometimes you end up getting so severe that you have to actually wipe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4396.7s	4396.7	 out all the immune cells in your body and you end up with a bone marrow transplant. So you get new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4403.1s	4403.1	 bone marrow put in, new blood cells put in. And hopefully, if you can survive the therapy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4408.0s	4408.0	 and survive that treatment, that new bone marrow will produce new immune cells and your body will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4412.9s	4412.9	 recover and you will be cured of your blood cancer. So what happened is people had HIV.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4419.0s	4419.0	 And when you get this bone marrow transplant, they give you radiation and chemo and they wipe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4423.9s	4423.9	 out all your blood cells. And then they give you this bone marrow transplant. So they selectively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4430.2s	4430.2	 chose bone marrow stem cells that came from people that have the genetic mutation that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4439.3s	4439.3	 prevents HIV. So then when these HIV patients that got blood cancer, got a bone marrow transplant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4445.4s	4445.4	 with this mutation in it, they were cured of HIV. And so it's a pretty profound kind of demonstration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4451.8s	4451.8	 of what we already knew, which is that this genetic mutation can prevent HIV. And there are a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4459.5s	4459.5	 therapies that are underway right now to actually use gene editing to induce that mutation in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4468.1s	4468.1	 people's blood cells and in their bone marrow without needing to give them a whole transplant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4472.6s	4472.6	 The first guy that did it, the first guy that did it was German, right? Or he was in Germany,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4477.7s	4477.7	 I think. And he unfortunately passed away. They cured his HIV AIDS, but he unfortunately had a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4485.8s	4485.8	 relapse of the leukemia that killed him. But I think all three cases of people that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4491.0s	4491.0	 have been quote unquote cured have been these leukemia patients.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4495.4s	4495.4	 But I'll say two things about the future of this kind of possibility. Number one is you don't need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4500.8s	4500.8	 to get a bone marrow transplant to have this mutation induced in your cells to prevent this

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4512.7s	4512.7	 are now developing gene editing therapies where rather than go and get a whole bone marrow transplant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4517.3s	4517.3	 to cure your HIV, we can actually edit your cells. Those edited cells will now be resistant and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4522.0s	4522.0	 will be resolved of HIV. The second thing is the way that they gave people the bone marrow transplant,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4526.4s	4526.4	 the way they created those stem cells for the bone marrow transplant was from umbilical cord
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4531.3s	4531.3	 blood from newborns, which is very rich in stem cells.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4535.8s	4535.8	 And this is a traditional way of kind of giving people stem cell based therapies is you go and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4540.1s	4540.1	 source stem cells from another body or your own body, which are called autologous stem cells.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4544.6s	4544.6	 But like I just want to say one thing, what's really interesting in the future is not going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4548.8s	4548.8	 be about pulling other people's stem cells into your body and finding them from, you know, fetal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4553.2s	4553.2	 blood or what have you. We now have the technology, which I've talked about multiple times on the show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4557.8s	4557.8	 called Yamanaka factors, where theoretically we can take your cells from your own body,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4563.5s	4563.5	 turn them into stem cells, grow them in a lab and use that as the therapy that's called autologous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4569.7s	4569.7	 stem cell therapy. And rather than use stem cells or trying to find them and, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4573.6s	4573.6	 figure them out where they are in your body and pull them out, we can actually do stem cells
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4577.1s	4577.1	 for your body. And that's like, you know, 15 years out is autologous induced stem cell therapy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4582.9s	4582.9	 where you actually make your own stem cells and then give yourself all sorts of therapies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4586.2s	4586.2	 not just bone marrow transplants, but you can heal lots of tissue in the body using these stem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4590.7s	4590.7	 cell systems. We don't really hear about HIV AIDS anymore. In that article, I think it said that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4595.1s	4595.1	 there was about 37 million people around the world that have HIV AIDS. And it's incredible,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4599.9s	4599.9	 actually, the amount of progress that science has made in this disease. I remember when I was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4603.0s	4603.0	 growing up, it was made to be like this incredible boogeyman. And it really governed like a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4612.0s	4612.0	 social norms at the time, because we were still discovering what HIV AIDS was and, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4617.4s	4617.4	 how do you think about sexual promiscuity, you know, from a moral and ethical perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4623.4s	4623.4	 I think it had a huge impact on my generation. And now it was a death sentence. They made us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4629.2s	4629.2	 paranoid. So here's what's happened. Therapies have gotten so good at suppressing suppressing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4634.1s	4634.1	 the virus. If the virus is suppressed far enough, even though you are always going to be infected,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4638.9s	4638.9	 if it's suppressed far enough, the WHO and the FDA have both said you can still have unprotected
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4644.0s	4644.0	 sex and not transmit HIV. And so even though there are plenty of people out there that might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4648.3s	4648.3	 be having unprotected sex with HIV, the therapies have suppressed the viral load to the point that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4654.2s	4654.2	 they're not transmitting it actively. And so that's been a big breakthrough in science over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4657.4s	4657.4	 the last decade. And then they also had these prep pills, right, which people could take proactively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4661.7s	4661.7	 if they thought they might, you know, find themselves. But I mean, Chamath, you and I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4665.0s	4665.0	 lived in a generation where, I mean, it was the end of things. Yeah. Well, I mean, it was the end
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4670.6s	4670.6	 of days. And they're like, I don't know. It was a single biggest thing that I was that I was taught
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4676.3s	4676.3	 in sex ed classes to be afraid of. Be really scared at all costs. And then the problem that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4682.1s	4682.1	 it created was like, you know, in countries that had a large Catholic population, you know, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4687.1s	4687.1	 Catholic Church was so, you know, evil, they had they were undecided on. They were the opposite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4694.3s	4694.3	 Right. They told people in Africa to not use condoms. When AIDS was rampant, it was the biggest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4701.8s	4701.8	 evil, second biggest evil the Catholic Church did in modern history. Obviously, the first we know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4706.4s	4706.4	 I have a contribution to the segment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4712.4s	4712.4	 I know. I remember how scared people were of AIDS, you know, back in the 1980s when this came up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4721.3s	4721.3	 And I remember that there was a head of the NIH who even whipped up people's fear, hold on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4727.4s	4727.4	 people's fear by saying that even casual even casual contact within the same household
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4734.1s	4734.1	 can spread it. And you know who that head of NIH was?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4737.2s	4737.2	 Anthony Fauci.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4737.7s	4737.7	 You know who that head of NIH was?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4739.4s	4739.4	 Yes, we know Fauci dedicated his life to trying to solve and reduce the suffering of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4745.1s	4745.1	 software AIDS and HIV.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4746.4s	4746.4	 No, in the 1980s, in the 1980s, he was the face of government difference towards AIDS.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4751.5s	4751.5	 And he spread fear and was medically wrong about it. Go check the records.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4755.7s	4755.7	 He was a screw up then and he's a screw up now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4758.6s	4758.6	 He worked tirelessly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4759.1s	4759.1	 He didn't work tirelessly on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4761.8s	4761.8	 J. Cal, I think Sachs is right in the sense that like what we thought we knew back then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4765.8s	4765.8	 turned out to be wrong. And I think that's a really important point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4769.0s	4769.0	 You know, particularly in science, it's a process of discovery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4772.5s	4772.5	 What we thought we knew back then turned out it was all a hypothesis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4775.9s	4775.9	 It's all a thesis until it's proven or disproven. And that's the case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4779.8s	4779.8	 Read Andrew Sullivan. I mean, you know, Fauci was absolutely the enemy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4785.0s	4785.0	 public enemy number one of the gay movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4788.4s	4788.4	 Who is it Tony?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4789.1s	4789.1	 Tony, Tony. Yeah, well, it was a Tony, Tony Perkins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4793.1s	4793.1	 There was actually a debate that Fauci was in on AIDS where a gay actress literally said to him,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4798.6s	4798.6	 I hate you. And if you read Andrew Sullivan's blog, he will talk about how he remembers back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4803.4s	4803.4	 in the 1980s that Fauci was sort of public enemy number one in the gay community because of his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4809.6s	4809.6	 position on this during the Reagan administration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4811.8s	4811.8	 And so it is a lot of civil disobedience act up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4815.1s	4815.1	 Remember, and he responded by putting massive resources into this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4819.8s	4819.8	 So I think, you know, if he was, that's not listening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4823.0s	4823.0	 Listen to Andrew Sullivan on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4824.2s	4824.2	 Okay, Andrew Sullivan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4825.9s	4825.9	 He is not that right. Wait, Andrew Sullivan is the reason why more than any other public intellectual,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4831.7s	4831.7	 why we have marriage equality today. He is number one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4834.7s	4834.7	 He advocated for marriage equality and in the New Republic made the case for it before anybody else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4840.1s	4840.1	 and popularized that argument.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4841.4s	4841.4	 I'm a fan of his writing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4843.2s	4843.2	 Don't try and portray him as a far right wing or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4846.9s	4846.9	 You're going to Fauci's intent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4848.6s	4848.6	 Anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4848.8s	4848.8	 You want to believe that Fauci is an evil person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4850.6s	4850.6	 I think you and many other people have mysteriously forgotten who Fauci really is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4856.0s	4856.0	 Okay. You think, I know the conspiracy that you think Fauci's intent is to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4860.2s	4860.2	 you know, cover up the, and he intentionally was working against solving for HIV.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4866.3s	4866.3	 That's ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4867.0s	4867.0	 No, I didn't say intentionally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4868.7s	4868.7	 Do you think Fauci had good intentions?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4870.2s	4870.2	 Yeah, and you inferred it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4871.4s	4871.4	 Sax, do you think Fauci had good intentions?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4873.3s	4873.3	 I don't really care about his intentions. I just want to look at his actions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4876.6s	4876.6	 It's amazing. It's amazing to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4878.9s	4878.9	 It's amazing to me that a public official who was so wrong back then in the 1980s and 1990s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4888.0s	4888.0	 on the public health crisis of our time would just be given a free pass
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4891.8s	4891.8	 and along comes a new public health crisis in the last couple of years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4894.6s	4894.6	 And he's been completely wrong about that too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4896.9s	4896.9	 So why are you giving this guy a free pass?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4898.4s	4898.4	 Sax, I don't get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4899.0s	4899.0	 Hey, Sax, in a cloud of uncertainty, in a time of war,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4903.2s	4903.2	 do you think that leaders need to show strong intent and clear signals?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4907.0s	4907.0	 Or do you think that they should be wishy washy because they don't know enough?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4911.0s	4911.0	 I think they should just be right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4913.4s	4913.4	 And if they're trying the best with what they have,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4915.0s	4915.0	 with the information they have at the time that they have it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4917.5s	4917.5	 Okay. Well, yeah, there's some forgiveness for making mistakes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4921.4s	4921.4	 but when you're constantly wrong, maybe it's time to get somebody else in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4924.4s	4924.4	 That's true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4925.0s	4925.0	 And look, and Fauci, by the way, Fauci app with respect to code,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4928.2s	4928.2	 we talked about it before, 100% participated in a suppression
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4934.0s	4934.0	 of the investigation into the origins of COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4936.5s	4936.5	 There was an active attempt to suppress that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4938.6s	4938.6	 Come on, you know that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4940.2s	4940.2	 The FOIA'd emails show it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4943.1s	4943.1	 It's a good science segment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4946.6s	4946.6	 I do want to give a shout out to the researchers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4950.5s	4950.5	 who actually did this with this woman in New York.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4953.1s	4953.1	 It's pretty freaking incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4954.9s	4954.9	 What's incredible is that they did it with HIV patients who had blood cancer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4959.7s	4959.7	 and it was a really kind of like thoughtfully designed experiment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4962.6s	4962.6	 Incredibly thoughtful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4963.4s	4963.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4963.8s	4963.8	 It's been four years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4964.7s	4964.7	 So, I mean, this has been baking for a long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4966.6s	4966.6	 By the way, as I zoom out and hear you guys talk about what HIV was like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4970.2s	4970.2	 you know, back in the day and the fear around it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4972.2s	4972.2	 I do think that 30, 40 years from now, given the tools we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4975.6s	4975.6	 with induced stem cells and cell-based therapies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4978.6s	4978.6	 and there are hundreds of cell-based therapies coming to market over the next few years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4981.8s	4981.8	 they're all in late stage clinical trials as well as gene editing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4984.6s	4984.6	 I think, hopefully, and I'm optimistic that one day we will look back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4988.2s	4988.2	 at cancer and aging in the same way that we're talking about HIV today,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4991.8s	4991.8	 and that both of those diseases can and will be resolved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4994.8s	4994.8	 with the tools that we're developing through science.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4997.1s	4997.1	 And, you know, there's going to be bumps along the road,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=4999.7s	4999.7	 but, man, it's so clear that it's going to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5001.9s	5001.9	 Go, Sachs. Go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5003.3s	5003.3	 Look, I think what Freeberg just said actually is really important and inspiring,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5007.8s	5007.8	 and I think it's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5008.6s	5008.6	 And I was kind of joking around with the Fauci thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5010.4s	5010.4	 I didn't expect it to become a tangent, so I don't need to keep going on about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5014.2s	5014.2	 Wait until you see him in editing try to change his position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5017.5s	5017.5	 No, I'm not going to change anything in editing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5019.0s	5019.0	 Keep that whole segment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5021.0s	5021.0	 Can you use a, can I do a voiceover to change my opinion?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5023.0s	5023.0	 If you had it become so argumentative, we wouldn't have spent five minutes on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5026.4s	5026.4	 If I'm correct, your incorrect position that Fauci's intent was wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5029.5s	5029.5	 Give me your final on-ramp, please, because I've got to fly to Europe. Go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5031.8s	5031.8	 Okay, here we go. David Sachs and Paul Graham have gotten into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5037.0s	5037.0	 It's a battle for the ages, and the stakes are so low, the stakes are so high,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5042.5s	5042.5	 and the animosity is so high because the stakes are so low.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5046.2s	5046.2	 Here we go. David Sachs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5048.2s	5048.2	 Wait, before this, does Phil Hellmuth qualify this as a billionaire battle or a quasi-billionaire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5055.8s	5055.8	 battle?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5056.2s	5056.2	 Billionaire, billionaire, billionaire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5058.6s	5058.6	 Literally, he revealed the billionaire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5061.4s	5061.4	 If you follow Phil Hellmuth's account, it's being DA greatest, being Doug greatest on Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5067.2s	5067.2	 Follow being DA greatest to get that Phil.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5070.9s	5070.9	 Phil Hellmuth outed on his Twitter that his new billionaire bestie is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5078.2s	5078.2	 which he stole bestie from me. I used to call everybody bestie. He just co-opted it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5081.8s	5081.8	 Like he co-opted me calling Tramont the dictator, but I'll tell the dictator origin story later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5086.6s	5086.6	 Is Stanley from DoorDash?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5088.8s	5088.8	 Stanley Tang, co-founder, chief product officer of DoorDash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5092.0s	5092.0	 Great guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5093.1s	5093.1	 Really? Great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5094.0s	5094.0	 Phil Hellmuth's latest truffle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5096.2s	5096.2	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5098.3s	5098.3	 He found it. Okay, here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5100.2s	5100.2	 So you can introduce him to Paul Graham.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5102.4s	5102.4	 Go ahead, Sachs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5103.3s	5103.3	 All right, here's the issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5105.0s	5105.0	 What's your vote to pick? What's your beat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5106.1s	5106.1	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5106.9s	5106.9	 Actually, I did not seek out this beat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5108.7s	5108.7	 Sachs Vendetta section of the poll.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5110.3s	5110.3	 No, no, no, no, no, listen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5112.0s	5112.0	 PG waded into my tweets. He came after me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5115.5s	5115.5	 Waded into it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5116.3s	5116.3	 Yeah, he did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5116.9s	5116.9	 He was not waiting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5118.5s	5118.5	 I love it. Please, any billionaires out there who want to like debate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5121.6s	5121.6	 like come wading into my tweets. Mark Cuban did it, made a big ass of himself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5126.1s	5126.1	 I don't want to deter these guys from wading in because it's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5129.4s	5129.4	 Here's what basically happened is I tweeted a video of all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5134.2s	5134.2	 multi-millionaire celebrity hypocrites partying massless at the Super Bowl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5138.9s	5138.9	 And then meanwhile, the next day, my three kids have to go to school in California
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5143.4s	5143.4	 wearing their masks. That is ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5147.5s	5147.5	 Okay, it makes no sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5150.1s	5150.1	 We all know that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5151.2s	5151.2	 Okay, any sane person knows that. That's what I tweeted about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5155.0s	5155.0	 I don't know why of all issues that was triggering in a PG,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5158.2s	5158.2	 but he had to come in and say, well, they were all partying outdoors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5161.5s	5161.5	 It's like, really?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5163.2s	5163.2	 It looks to me like they're in a skybox.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5164.9s	5164.9	 And if it has three walls and a ceiling, I call that a room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5168.3s	5168.3	 But in any event, that wasn't he was he was misinformed because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5173.1s	5173.1	 the rule of the Super Bowl was that if you were not eating and drinking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5176.0s	5176.0	 anyone under over the age of two have to be wearing a mask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5180.2s	5180.2	 So, you know, my point stands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5182.3s	5182.3	 I just want to air.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5183.4s	5183.4	 So here's where things kind of went south is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5186.3s	5186.3	 is so that I tweeted, blink twice, you know, Paul.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5191.8s	5191.8	 And here's the thing, I wasn't totally trying to be snarky with that comment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5196.5s	5196.5	 Here's why I said that is because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5198.1s	5198.1	 Explain what that means. I didn't understand that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5199.7s	5199.7	 What does that mean? Blink twice?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5200.9s	5200.9	 Well, it means like you are a captor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5203.4s	5203.4	 You're being held kidnapped by these concepts that you have to wear a mask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5206.8s	5206.8	 You're being held hostage by somebody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5208.5s	5208.5	 And the reason why I said that is because is is look, if PG had just been some crazy dumb person,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5214.3s	5214.3	 I never would have said that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5215.4s	5215.4	 The fact is that PG is smart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5218.2s	5218.2	 He writes extremely well, publishes a lot of interesting things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5221.2s	5221.2	 He's an independent thinker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hm1FzVako&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=67&t=5223.2s	5223.2	 So it almost seemed to me like somebody is holding him hostage here
