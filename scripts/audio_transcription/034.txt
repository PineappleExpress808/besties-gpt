https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=408.9s	408.9	 I think I'm most interested in hearing from Friedberg about is the lab leak theory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=413.5s	413.5	 and I think that this touches on a little bit of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=417.3s	417.3	 politicization of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=419.7s	419.7	 Science I guess we there's a lab in Wuhan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=423.5s	423.5	 I think it's more Trump derangement syndrome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=425.7s	425.7	 It didn't allow us to see the forest from the trees and the same words just said by a different president all of a sudden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=431.1s	431.1	 invokes a an investigation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=433.5s	433.5	 Yeah, so I mean there is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=436.7s	436.7	 COVID laboratory in Wuhan. It is the only one in China and that's where the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=443.0s	443.0	 Virology labs where they study viruses. Yes, but specifically they've studied COVID viruses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=449.4s	449.4	 They have yeah, that's I mean that's a big class of virus so and it's the only one in China and it's funded by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=456.3s	456.3	 America and China and the who?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=459.3s	459.3	 The Institute of Virology. I mean this is this is I mean this is like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=464.1s	464.1	 One Institute of Virology was posting job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=467.6s	467.6	 Rex two years ago for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=470.4s	470.4	 Specifically for researchers of bat viruses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=472.6s	472.6	 We know they were studying bat viruses at this place and we want just happens to be the place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=477.8s	477.8	 Where a novel coronavirus that seems derived from a bat virus, you know, like it emerges
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=484.1s	484.1	 I mean, what are the odds right? I mean, this was such an obvious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=488.0s	488.0	 theory the idea that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=490.0s	490.0	 You know COVID might have leaked from from this particular lab and yet we were forbidden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=495.4s	495.4	 From talking about it. I guess till Donald Trump was out of office
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=498.2s	498.2	 I mean, I think there's really two stories here. One is Chinese culpability, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=503.2s	503.2	 In the spread of the virus the other one is the media story
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=506.6s	506.6	 Why were we not allowed to have this discussion? Why did the media?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=511.3s	511.3	 Brand anybody who discussed this leak theory as being some sort of conspiracy theorist or a racist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=518.0s	518.0	 Why were big tech companies censoring or removing any user-generated content from their sites that were putting forward this theory?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=525.8s	525.8	 You know, why was the media and big tech doing this? I mean, is it somehow I can I can tell you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=530.7s	530.7	 But somehow they were telling us it was more racist to talk about a lab accident than to David because the person who could have explained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=538.6s	538.6	 It in a de-escalated factual way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=541.6s	541.6	 chose to escalate it and be emotional and superficial and that was Donald Trump and so I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=547.8s	547.8	 Don't I don't think that you could point to us and say we could have changed how the narrative is exploited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=552.4s	552.4	 All of us are just normal average people on the ground, but there probably is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=557.3s	557.3	 Sort of you know a hierarchy of like information and there probably isn't a single individual
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=562.8s	562.8	 Individual beyond the president that who has access to more information
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=565.9s	565.9	 And so if he was if he was just more moderate and normal and basically said hey guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=570.9s	570.9	 there is a legitimate risk that we need to investigate because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=574.8s	574.8	 fast forward basically 18 months later and this president who is moderate you can like him or not like him, but he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=581.4s	581.4	 Kind of moderate and unoffensive says basically that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=585.5s	585.5	 Says basically that and now we have this news cycle about investigating something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=590.7s	590.7	 We should have been investigating 18 months ago just at least to get to the bottom of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=594.3s	594.3	 What was going on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=595.2s	595.2	 But Trump had to make it such a big deal and about himself and I think that's a takeaway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=599.4s	599.4	 But just because Trump says something doesn't mean it's not true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=603.3s	603.3	 I mean he is occasionally gonna say things that are true and that's not what my point is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=608.8s	608.8	 President of the United States you just have to have more discipline
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=611.3s	611.3	 Well, but but I think you're right in the sense that the reason this became a forbidden topic is because the media had to act
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=618.2s	618.2	 Like anything Trump said is is untrue or crazy or race. It's a failure on both sides then David
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=623.6s	623.6	 I mean the the media is failing to be independent critical thinkers and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=627.8s	627.8	 Trump is failing to be a good leader and be clear and that means you have to be an independent critical thinker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=633.2s	633.2	 The media's first obligation here is to the truth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=636.1s	636.1	 They're not supposed to distort the truth or push forward a false narrative because of the political consequences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=641.8s	641.8	 And and that they didn't want to be seen as helping Trump in any way and that's really what their motivation was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=647.4s	647.4	 But I find it equally disturbing that Big Tech was censoring the truth on this issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=652.2s	652.2	 The whole point of having a free marketplace of ideas is so that we can arrive at the truth and how's that gonna be possible?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=657.1s	657.1	 When big I'm sorry, I really disagree with you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=659.9s	659.9	 I think that the the Big Tech's decision to censure this information was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=664.4s	664.4	 Was a derivative of the first two things like I don't think that decision would have happened had Trump been normal and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=672.5s	672.5	 Then you know media would have just listened and said okay. Maybe there's a chance this guy's right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=677.5s	677.5	 He's saying and acting in a normal way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=680.0s	680.0	 Let's go investigate and then Big Tech would have basically said we don't know the truth one way or the other but it seems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=685.9s	685.9	 Legitimate sane people are on both sides of issues because Donald Trump published mean tweets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=690.7s	690.7	 It was okay for Big Tech or rather the media to basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=695.2s	695.2	 portray the correct theory as a lie in a conspiracy and it was okay for Big Tech to engage in censorship on that basis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=702.0s	702.0	 What I'm saying is the following the president of the United States
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=706.5s	706.5	 Independent and whoever it is has a very specific
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=710.5s	710.5	 Responsibility to be measured
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=713.0s	713.0	 To be unemotional and to be about the bigger picture. That's what the president of the United States is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=719.5s	719.5	 Responsibility is no matter who holds the office and then the media's job is to fact-check that and hold that person accountable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=726.7s	726.7	 And call that person in a transparent manner free Berg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=730.5s	730.5	 Yes, or no, is it a viable theory and then let's get to odds and percentages
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=736.9s	736.9	 I mean as a scientist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=738.9s	738.9	 Do you think that this is because came from a wet market or some accidental exposure?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=743.9s	743.9	 Somebody eating bat or some cross-contamination a bat and a pig and then somebody eats the pig or do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=750.1s	750.1	 Somebody from the lot from the lab accidentally brought it home with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=754.5s	754.5	 Don't know doesn't matter. I feel like we need to kind of recognize that bio
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=761.2s	761.2	 warfare and bioterrorism is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=764.3s	764.3	 A real risk and I think more importantly that this moment whether or not it's proven
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=769.3s	769.3	 It will never be proven or disproven one way or the other. So it really doesn't matter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=772.5s	772.5	 What will ultimately happen is we are gonna kind of become much more cognizant of these sorts of threats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=778.9s	778.9	 To the human population. Let me be very specific
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=781.6s	781.6	 a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=782.5s	782.5	 kid in high school
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=784.2s	784.2	 Could write up some RNA code
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=786.9s	786.9	 Today on their computer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=788.9s	788.9	 Order that RNA to be delivered to them by what's called an oligo printing facility get this RNA booted up turn it into a virus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=795.9s	795.9	 And they could release that thing into the wild
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=798.9s	798.9	 There are several very cheap over-the-counter internet based ways that one could do this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=805.3s	805.3	 So the fact that there's some sophisticated government run lab doing this I don't think matters as much what's really compelling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=812.5s	812.5	 In this whole storyline is like holy shit. This is possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=816.3s	816.3	 It's possible that there's either an engineered or discovered virus and it shows just how if these things leak out and they are infectious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=822.7s	822.7	 And they are transmissible can become a real risk to the global population and it's not just viruses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=829.1s	829.1	 There are other mechanisms of bio warfare that can be printed and created
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=834.0s	834.0	 Using similar techniques of genomics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=836.5s	836.5	 There are proteins called pre-ons and pre-ons cause other proteins to fold in a mismatched way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=842.9s	842.9	 This is actually what mad cow disease is. It's a pre-on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=845.7s	845.7	 It's a protein that you find in the brain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=847.6s	847.6	 And if you eat this particular protein ends up in your brain it causes the other proteins in your brain that match that protein
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=854.1s	854.1	 To misfold and it basically replicates and creates this cascading effect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=858.5s	858.5	 It's basically like aliens like aliens and in fact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=861.4s	861.4	 Yeah, but I guess my point is like whether it's pre-ons or or viruses there are techniques and there are capabilities and instruments now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=869.1s	869.1	 that all humans have access to that theoretically could allow for the booting or the creation and the distribution of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=876.8s	876.8	 Truly terrifying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=878.5s	878.5	 tools
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=879.9s	879.9	 Biological tools now this comes hand-in-hand with the incredible optimism and opportunity that these tools present much like chemical engineering presented in the early 20th century
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=887.7s	887.7	 To humanity we could create things like DDT and kill ourselves or we could create things like artificial fertilizer and feed ourselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=894.8s	894.8	 And so there's this this tremendous as there is with any new technology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=898.5s	898.5	 This tremendous kind of optimism and fear and it's going to create I think a very powerful debate narrative over the coming decade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=905.5s	905.5	 On what do we do with these tools? Is it even possible to regulate them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=909.3s	909.3	 Where is this going to go and what are the risks and it's not necessarily just government agencies that we need to kind of be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=914.9s	914.9	 Considering here. It's the fact that there's a democratization of this tooling which is enabling all right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=920.2s	920.2	 Does it sex does it matter if it was leaked or not freeberg is saying it's a matter of big picture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=925.4s	925.4	 Of course, you disagree with of course it matters and and the only reason we don't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=931.0s	931.0	 conclusively that it came from a lab is because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=934.5s	934.5	 The Chinese government wouldn't let they thwarted the investigation. They wouldn't let the investigators come in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=939.7s	939.7	 And so the smoke is pouring out of the Wuhan Institute of Virology and they will not allow the firefighters in because those firefighters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=947.2s	947.2	 Come from the West we could establish the truth of what happened if they would let us talk to the scientists who work at that lab
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=954.0s	954.0	 If they could go what would you do about it? Let's say that you find out that it did like yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=957.1s	957.1	 Well at a minute. Well, first of all, we're talking about a virus has killed millions of people's millions of people across the world. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=963.3s	963.3	 Caused enormous damage to the economy to our economy to economies all over the world, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=969.3s	969.3	 We have to think through carefully what the consequences would be but it matters a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=973.7s	973.7	 How the Chinese government handled this at a minimum at a minimum?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=977.8s	977.8	 We need to decouple ourselves from China with regard to anything. That's a vital American interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=983.7s	983.7	 We cannot be dependent on them for the manufacturing of our PPE for our antibiotics for our pharmaceuticals. It is insane
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=990.7s	990.7	 So there's nothing we're gonna do if we're not there's nothing we're gonna do to China in terms of sanctions if we find out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=996.0s	996.0	 They covered up a leak if there's an accidental leak and they covered it up. We're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1003.4s	1003.4	 It acts more as a warning sign for us to do better and be more independent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1008.3s	1008.3	 It's a principle of escalation. They are still the critical supplier to most of American manufacturing and industry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1014.2s	1014.2	 Every product that American companies make most products have some sort of Chinese produced input

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1027.3s	1027.3	 Critical components that we need for our pharmaceutical industry. So drug manufacturing and so it's not about sanctioning China
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1035.4s	1035.4	 It's about getting our act together Chamath you agree with this and what do you think if we did find out that it was in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1041.3s	1041.3	 Fact a covered-up leak which I think is the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1045.3s	1045.3	 reasonable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1046.9s	1046.9	 Assumption here. What should we do as America as a country global?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1051.8s	1051.8	 Reaction to China. I agree with Friedberg and David Sachs in in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1058.0s	1058.0	 parts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1059.6s	1059.6	 There's nothing to do. I think we have to move on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1062.5s	1062.5	 I think it's important to get to the bottom of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1066.4s	1066.4	 It'll maybe help eliminate some of the politicizing of science that we've seen as a result of this thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1073.4s	1073.4	 But ultimately what's done is done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1076.7s	1076.7	 instead what I think we have to learn from it is you can't elect hotheads and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1082.1s	1082.1	 people who are unpredictable and unreliable to basically be our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1087.3s	1087.3	 truth-tellers and fact-tellers and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1089.3s	1089.3	 If anybody but Donald Trump was the president of the United States in that moment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1093.4s	1093.4	 We probably could have had a chance of getting to the bottom of it when it counted and whether you support him or not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1098.9s	1098.9	 It doesn't matter the style
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1101.2s	1101.2	 Made it impossible for anybody to really listen that to me is the most important takeaway of that moment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1107.1s	1107.1	 Which is he does have a responsibility above everybody else's the second thing is I think this is the most important macro
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1115.2s	1115.2	 Investing theme that I've seen in my lifetime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1117.9s	1117.9	 which is that globalization as we know it is over and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1121.7s	1121.7	 What Saksipoo just said is what I really believe which is that you have to onshore and you have to move to a place where?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1129.2s	1129.2	 You value resiliency over just in time and if you look at the businesses that get that need to get built
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1136.7s	1136.7	 in order to enable resiliency you will see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1140.3s	1140.3	 trillions of dollars of opportunity and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1142.7s	1142.7	 I really really believe in that that's that's very exciting to me. So instead of great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1147.6s	1147.6	 Yeah, instead of being anti-china, which I don't think is productive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1150.8s	1150.8	 I think it's better to be pro-america and say hey, let's just figure out how to build this stuff ourselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1155.1s	1155.1	 Now here's the problem though when the rubber meets the road
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1158.5s	1158.5	 The biggest impediment to on shoring jobs into the United States are the same people on the left who actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1165.8s	1165.8	 Claim that there is no upward mobility and here's why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1169.3s	1169.3	 When you go and you want to basically balkanize supply chains
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1174.1s	1174.1	 You are introducing inefficiency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1176.8s	1176.8	 You're also introducing some puts and takes in areas that today have been like third real issues. For example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1184.5s	1184.5	 The people on the left believe in climate change more than anybody else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1188.2s	1188.2	 But when you explain to them that in order to eliminate hydrocarbons, you actually have to mine critical minerals and metals out of the ground
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1196.1s	1196.1	 They're the same people that say no way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1198.5s	1198.5	 well, you can't have one without the other and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1201.4s	1201.4	 You actually have to have a rational conversation and realize like listen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1204.7s	1204.7	 We're gonna have to do this and so for example like Biden this past week somewhat capitulated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1210.3s	1210.3	 For environmental interests and said, you know what? Yes climate change is critical, but we're gonna try to get them from everywhere else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1215.6s	1215.6	 But America it's not gonna work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1218.1s	1218.1	 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1219.4s	1219.4	 That's kind of where like I'm a little frustrated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1221.9s	1221.9	 But those are my two takeaways number one is past
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1225.0s	1225.0	 Let's just get past China and let's just focus on the United States and number two is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1228.7s	1228.7	 Globalization as we know it is done and we need to focus on resiliency. Did you guys read the Wall Street Journal piece on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1236.0s	1236.0	 the miners who in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1239.1s	1239.1	 2012 were the ones who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1242.1s	1242.1	 You know were clearing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1244.5s	1244.5	 Essentially bat dung that yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1246.9s	1246.9	 And so this this is a really fascinating turn of events that we're starting to know what this lab was doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1253.1s	1253.1	 If you didn't see the Wall Street Journal story, we'll put it in the show notes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1256.2s	1256.2	 Yeah, we'll put the show notes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1257.2s	1257.2	 But in April 2012 six miners fell sick with a mysterious illness after entering the mine to clear bat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1261.9s	1261.9	 Guano, I guess is what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1263.9s	1263.9	 This
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1265.1s	1265.1	 Bat poop which is supposed to be a primary source of fertilizer worldwide. Yeah, so three of them died
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1272.0s	1272.0	 Chinese scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology were called in to investigate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1276.1s	1276.1	 After taking samples from bats in the mine identified several new coronaviruses now unanswered questions about the miners illness the viruses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1283.5s	1283.5	 Found at the site and the research done with them have elevated into the mainstream an idea once dismissed as a conspiracy theory that SARS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1290.2s	1290.2	 Cov-2 the virus that causes COVID-19 might have leaked from the lab in Wuhan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1294.1s	1294.1	 I mean, this is just becoming more and more obvious my my gut tells me that our government already knows this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1300.9s	1300.9	 Has known it for some time the 90-day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1304.1s	1304.1	 Sort of window that they've given the Chinese to kind of give us an answer as to what happened here is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1310.7s	1310.7	 Window dressing and then we're gonna start the process of becoming more independent from China because there's I mean, it's nothing you could do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1317.0s	1317.0	 How could we retaliate for an accident? We're not gonna get in a war over this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1321.4s	1321.4	 No one's suggesting that but I think we have to open our eyes to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1325.6s	1325.6	 The regime that we're dealing with over in China and just a late to add a layer to this analysis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1331.3s	1331.3	 Novel coronas coronaviruses are not the only thing coming out of Chinese labs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1336.2s	1336.2	 China is also the number one producer of fentanyl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1340.0s	1340.0	 Yes, and that's another truth that we can finally talk about now that Trump is out of office
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1345.3s	1345.3	 People haven't wanted to talk about it or they thought that you were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1348.3s	1348.3	 Hysterical or promoting a conspiracy theory if you talked about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1351.1s	1351.1	 But I just posted two articles in the chat one from Brookings and one from NPR
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1356.9s	1356.9	 About how China is the main source of fentanyl that's pouring into our streets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1361.0s	1361.0	 At first it makes a stopover in Mexico and then somehow it gets smuggled into the US
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1365.2s	1365.2	 this is a huge problem in our cities and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1369.9s	1369.9	 You know, I think this is not this is not accidental, you know, this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1375.3s	1375.3	 This is deliberate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1376.8s	1376.8	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1377.3s	1377.3	 The Chinese your position is the Chinese government is deliberately sending a super opioid drug into the United States
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1384.1s	1384.1	 for profit or to destabilize the country and different cities and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1389.1s	1389.1	 Create more division between the left and the right because homelessness and wealth inequality is getting mixed up with a super drug
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1396.7s	1396.7	 As opposed to a homeless problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1400.1s	1400.1	 This is getting a little long. I know it's getting crazy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1403.0s	1403.0	 Well, that's what I'm reflecting back to sex
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1405.3s	1405.3	 But how's it a conspiracy theory? We know that China is mass producing the fentanyl that's coming into the US
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1411.3s	1411.3	 We know that that fentanyl is creating a gigantic crisis of drug addiction and homelessness on the streets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1417.3s	1417.3	 We know they could stop it if they wanted to they have total control over that country. What is the conspiracy theory?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1425.1s	1425.1	 Yeah, I don't know if that's the equivalent of saying America produces all the world's cars. It's not America
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1431.5s	1431.5	 There are organizations within the United States that are under the purview
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1436.8s	1436.8	 CCP is handpicking who gets to run bite dance and ants and they're retiring CEOs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1442.4s	1442.4	 They get to decide what is produced in that country and who produces it you're telling me that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1447.8s	1447.8	 What do you think is going on in the federal government when they say to their counterparts at the Chinese Communist Party?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1454.6s	1454.6	 Hey, we need you guys to stop producing fentanyl. Do you think that conversation is happening?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1458.7s	1458.7	 Yeah, it was this was an agenda item during the Trump administration and talks between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1464.5s	1464.5	 What the feedback was from China, I mean, what's the counterpoint?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1467.1s	1467.1	 I don't know enough but what is the counterpoint that China would then say like why they can't stop it or why this is still happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1473.1s	1473.1	 I mean my understanding is there are thousands of kind of you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1477.1s	1477.1	 Call them under regulated factories and facilities in China any number of which this could be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1482.4s	1482.4	 Question it just does China have a fentanyl addiction problem in their streets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1487.1s	1487.1	 We don't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1489.7s	1489.7	 And the answer is they round up every single person who's a Hong Kong dissident who would sell a book or if anybody goes to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1496.6s	1496.6	 The that's fair Tienanmen Square
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1498.9s	1498.9	 Jail for five years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1500.3s	1500.3	 They just announced Hong Kong citizens who go to the Tiananmen Square
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1504.3s	1504.3	 Memorial this year are getting five years and if you tweet about it you get one year in jail so they can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1509.9s	1509.9	 They can control anything in their country just to build on your control point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1513.7s	1513.7	 I tweeted this to you guys in the group chat we can post this as well in the show notes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1517.2s	1517.2	 But there was an article in Forbes this week that said friends don't let friends become Chinese billionaires
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1523.8s	1523.8	 That was the title and the data point that this is an old story. By the way, it's like eight years old
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1528.9s	1528.9	 Just you know, no, no, no, this was written now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1531.6s	1531.6	 That might have been no, I think read the story
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1534.0s	1534.0	 I think at the top it says the story is like eight years old
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1536.0s	1536.0	 But anyway, it is true that Chinese billionaire Chinese billionaire dies every 40 days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1540.8s	1540.8	 Unnatural deaths have taken the lives of 72 mainland billionaires over the past eight years 15 were murdered
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1546.0s	1546.0	 It's the Wild West over there man 17 committed suicide 7 died from accidents and 19 accidents and 14 were executed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1555.1s	1555.1	 The 14 for can you imagine 14 billionaires just get executed is that story real? What is that story from some off?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1561.6s	1561.6	 I mean, well this this may be is a good segue into coinbase fact-check, but this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1566.7s	1566.7	 An article in Forbes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1568.9s	1568.9	 All right India versus what's up? Well, I'll give you the rundown on the India thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1574.8s	1574.8	 So basically, you know there there is a right to you know, free speech effectively in the Indian Constitution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1581.5s	1581.5	 But then India passed the law effectively. I'll just I'll just summarize it as traceability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1587.1s	1587.1	 Which basically means that if you have an online network and you post something in the network if an Indian censor or an Indian regulator
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1594.8s	1594.8	 Or authority basically says hey, hold on. This is an issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1597.2s	1597.2	 They have the right to basically have the the the network or whoever owns that network
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1603.5s	1603.5	 Trace it down to its originating source. Now. That's a really important distinction because there are certain products
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1609.6s	1609.6	 so for example take whatsapp where a feature of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1613.4s	1613.4	 Product is end-to-end encryption, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1616.7s	1616.7	 so it's hopping around in ways that are very difficult and near to impossible for anybody to really figure out and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1622.5s	1622.5	 Now all of a sudden that that that element which used to be a feature is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1627.1s	1627.1	 Now a bug because if the Indian government says hey, hold on that statement. I have an issue with I need you to figure out who said that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1634.2s	1634.2	 They'll essentially have to undo all their end-to-end encryption to figure out. So then whatsapp filed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1640.0s	1640.0	 A court case in New Delhi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1642.7s	1642.7	 This week essentially I think asking for an injunction and so I think this is gonna go to a head but you have this now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1649.8s	1649.8	 State of affairs which I think is really interesting which is so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1653.3s	1653.3	 You know, we we talk about how we have an issue with Chinese censors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1656.9s	1656.9	 Well now here's a different more complicated example because this is the largest democracy in the world and what they were effectively saying is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1663.6s	1663.6	 We need to have an equivalent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1665.6s	1665.6	 Red button and a set of levers so that we can figure out what's going on when we choose and there's going to be a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1672.4s	1672.4	 Of implications because inside of India what's different than America as a democracy is it has lower
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1678.2s	1678.2	 It has lower average incomes. It has lower health. It has lower literacy rates. It has more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1686.0s	1686.0	 religious sort of tension
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1688.2s	1688.2	 And it's got you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1690.7s	1690.7	 Many many more young people who are more prone theoretically to get you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1696.2s	1696.2	 bamboozled by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1697.8s	1697.8	 misinformation and disinformation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1698.9s	1698.9	 And so, you know India sees those facts on the ground and probably wrote this law with those intentions in mind, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1705.2s	1705.2	 And it's had a bunch of these issues by the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1707.3s	1707.3	 Particularly between Muslims and Hindus. And so what do you do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1711.1s	1711.1	 You know, what is Facebook and WhatsApp supposed to do? What is Google supposed to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1715.3s	1715.3	 What does it mean for internet rights? I think it's a super super complicated problem. And do you prioritize?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1722.9s	1722.9	 misinformation and disinformation above
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1725.9s	1725.9	 The right for people's privacy and you're gonna see it unfold in the largest democracy in the world over the next couple months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1731.5s	1731.5	 I don't really know how I feel about it to be honest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1733.5s	1733.5	 Except I do think that Indian government has a right to set the rules of their own country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1739.1s	1739.1	 Well and set the rules they are I mean remember they also banned tik-tok in an instance and hundreds of other apps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1746.1s	1746.1	 I think 60 apps from China have been banned permanently in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1750.1s	1750.1	 India so India obviously has a different approach to China, which is we're gonna put our foot down now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1755.1s	1755.1	 Of course, they're involved in some skirmishes on their border. But yeah, it does seem sex. What do you what's your thought you have?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1761.6s	1761.6	 personal right to privacy end-to-end decryption and then you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1765.8s	1765.8	 You know the ability to run back door a back door to it. Yeah, this is another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1771.1s	1771.1	 major
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1772.5s	1772.5	 Sledgehammer to globalization, you know in the in the mid to late 90s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1776.8s	1776.8	 We had this beautiful dream that we're gonna create a single internet for the whole world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1779.9s	1779.9	 It would create a single common market a single place for people to interact and go and that all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1786.1s	1786.1	 Barriers these geographic barriers tribal barriers would come down over time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1789.9s	1789.9	 And now what we see is the trade barriers have come up and now instead of having one internet for the whole world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1796.4s	1796.4	 It's fragmenting into a bunch of different internets governed by local laws
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1800.9s	1800.9	 You know, it started with the the great firewall of China creating sort of a separate Chinese internet now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1806.4s	1806.4	 you're starting to see country by country regulations and I just think it's it's sort of an inevitable reaction that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1813.3s	1813.3	 the power of governments and sovereignty's comes before the power of corporations and they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1819.2s	1819.2	 Reimposing their will and I think the question for all these companies is gonna be where they decide they're willing to play and you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1827.1s	1827.1	 I think now I do think it's a very different choice whether you want to play in India or whether you want to play in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1832.5s	1832.5	 China because in China when the government tells you to hand over information on dissidents you really are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1839.9s	1839.9	 Aiding and abetting what could be political oppression
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1843.4s	1843.4	 Whereas India being a democracy. I don't think the choice is quite the same at all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1847.8s	1847.8	 and so, you know, I do think these tech companies are gonna have to decide which countries they want to sort of play ball with and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1855.0s	1855.0	 Ultimately, I think they probably have to make a determination
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1858.2s	1858.2	 Based on working with the Democratic ones and they're probably gonna have to exit the ones that engage in political repression in my first of all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1865.6s	1865.6	 I think that's really well said what you said in my in my annual letter last year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1869.4s	1869.4	 I kind of wrote like here's the white paper on how to dismantle big tech and there were two frames one was around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1875.1s	1875.1	 Taxation which we're also seeing but the second was on this regulator regulatory point David that you're bringing up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1880.6s	1880.6	 That's the simplest way to sort of break these companies down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1883.7s	1883.7	 Which is if you have to engineer now instead of one monolithic code base
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1888.8s	1888.8	 Multiple instantiations where you can't even get the leverage of like, you know cross-border data centers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1894.3s	1894.3	 I mean by the way, there there's a really interesting thing that the Biden tax bill also proposes on this dimension, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1900.3s	1900.3	 It's gonna prevent you from sending IP, you know into places like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1905.1s	1905.1	 Like Ireland and keeping it there, right? So you can't have all of a sudden, you know code that's running in Ireland that executes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1912.4s	1912.4	 Something that makes money so that you can pay Irish tax versus something code that runs in America. That's largely, you know user-oriented
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1919.2s	1919.2	 That's not gonna happen. That's not gonna be allowed anymore, right? So all of these things are happening at the same time essentially to reign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1926.2s	1926.2	 Big tech in making it almost a whack-a-mole problem inside these companies where you're fighting a tax thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1932.2s	1932.2	 For example, Google's fighting antitrust in France, then you're fighting antitrust at the EU level then you're fighting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1938.6s	1938.6	 You know traceability and encryption in India, then you're fighting, you know inversion of an IP in America
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1946.8s	1946.8	 Wow, like it's like all of a sudden the lawyers inside of these companies will outnumber the engineers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1952.0s	1952.0	 And I think a lot of this is the downstream
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1954.3s	1954.3	 Consequences of what happened back in January when Twitter and all the other big tech companies deep platform Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1960.4s	1960.4	 Remember at the time it wasn't just you know conservatives or in the US who raised alarm bells. It was Angela Merkel in in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1968.4s	1968.4	 Germany, it was the finance minister in France. I think India you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1973.2s	1973.2	 Talked about it. I think Modi had a statement about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1975.6s	1975.6	 They all woke up and said whoa a head of state can be deep platformed by Jack Dorsey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1981.6s	1981.6	 he's more powerful than the president of the United States and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1984.7s	1984.7	 Countries all around the world started looking at the power of big tech and realized that they're subordinate to all these tech billionaires and oligarchs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1991.7s	1991.7	 Tell me about Coinbase and fact-check. I think this thing is incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=1994.8s	1994.8	 I mean I have to say by the way the first thing I'll say about and this is this is the exact opposite of what I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2000.1s	2000.1	 Said the last time Bryan Armstrong wrote a memo this memo is excellent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2004.5s	2004.5	 And if you haven't had a chance to read it, we'll put it in the show notes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2008.8s	2008.8	 But Bryan's essay is super
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2011.5s	2011.5	 I think there have been a couple of CEO memos in the last two months that I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2015.1s	2015.1	 Honestly should be in the Hall of Fame in the Smithsonian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2017.9s	2017.9	 One is the Toby Lutke memo that the internal email he wrote and the second one is this one that Bryan wrote because I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2024.0s	2024.0	 This this thing is probably one of the most important things in my opinion that has been written
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2029.1s	2029.1	 By a CEO which has the potential to lead to huge systemic changes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2033.7s	2033.7	 Well, he echoed a lot of the things we've been saying on this part about going direct
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2038.0s	2038.0	 Don't let the press tell your story go direct get you get the truth out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2043.4s	2043.4	 They're basically what the what the blog said is they're gonna start using the Coinbase blog as a forum basically as a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2050.7s	2050.7	 media publication for for crypto related things and the fact-check part is that when the popular press
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2058.1s	2058.1	 Gets crypto wrong, which they do frequently in Coinbase's view Coinbase is gonna call them out and correct them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2063.7s	2063.7	 Yeah, so basically here's what he says the increased awareness has been great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2067.5s	2067.5	 Unfortunately, we also see misinformation published frequently as well rather in traditional media social media or by public figures
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2072.8s	2072.8	 This doesn't always come from negative intentions our business and crypto can be difficult to understand and often people are rushed to post first impressions online
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2079.6s	2079.6	 Making mistakes in the process that other times misinformation comes from people publishing their own agenda or from people who have a conflict of interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2086.0s	2086.0	 This is not unique to our business or industry, of course
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2088.5s	2088.5	 So how should companies respond one turn the other cheek to fight and three publish the truth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2095.1s	2095.1	 I believe there is a reasonable middle ground between these first two options
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2099.2s	2099.2	 Turning the other cheek and fighting which is to simply publish the truth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2104.0s	2104.0	 The way you fight back is you publish the truth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2106.6s	2106.6	 So that to me that's not a choice. Those are the same thing is you can either remain silent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2111.7s	2111.7	 Take the high road which always results in people believing whatever, you know lies are being said or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2118.5s	2118.5	 You fight back by telling the truth fact-check approach is not about antagonizing or embarrassing others
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2125.0s	2125.0	 It's a Brian Armstrong, but simply sharing what happened through our own channels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2128.3s	2128.3	 It also means sharing the good along with the bad with radical transparency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2132.5s	2132.5	 I just want to say that I wish him all the success in the world because I think if if if and as this works
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2138.4s	2138.4	 So it's which I think it will because people in the crypto universe are more prone to actually get their own information and do their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2144.9s	2144.9	 Diligence I think the spillover effects to other companies can be really positive all of this is going to the same place which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2151.9s	2151.9	 The intermediate layer of traditional media is basically getting whittled down, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2157.8s	2157.8	 There was a there was a different thing that happened in those last few weeks, which was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2162.1s	2162.1	 The Tribune Company, I think it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2164.6s	2164.6	 Basically got taken private by some hedge fund and in it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2168.2s	2168.2	 they talked about what has happened in the industry and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2171.5s	2171.5	 The most incredible thing was the amount of revenue that has disappeared from newspapers and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2177.0s	2177.0	 Literally from the tens of billions of dollars to basically single digit billions today over the last 20 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2182.7s	2182.7	 which effectively means traditional media's revenue source is going away and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2187.2s	2187.2	 If then all of a sudden if you take that media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2192.1s	2192.1	 Model away and there are no more economic incentives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2196.2s	2196.2	 Then it stands to reason that the overarching incentives that remain are around reputation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2202.0s	2202.0	 Which is then about facts and so the fact that Coinbase will have a place that says here are the facts and we're gonna put it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2208.2s	2208.2	 On chain permanently on the record. That's I think a really powerful idea and recent Horowitz, by the way same situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2214.8s	2214.8	 They're doing it in venture capital, you know, one of the largest and most prolific and important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2220.1s	2220.1	 sources of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2221.6s	2221.6	 Funding the future they're on the record on chain in their own way, right with their own media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2226.3s	2226.3	 And and they're now helping to tell the stories of other folks through it David Sachs, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2231.0s	2231.0	 Sachs has put so much content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2233.4s	2233.4	 In terms of teaching people about the business that he knows really well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2237.5s	2237.5	 But at the same time he's also been able to write about what he thinks about certain things and then eventually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2242.1s	2242.1	 On behalf of his companies, he'll be able to say things and do things as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2245.7s	2245.7	 So all of a sudden not all of a sudden, I guess we've seen it. But if we had to put a label on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2250.6s	2250.6	 This is the dismantling of traditional media it is happening in real time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2255.2s	2255.2	 And it's accelerating it turns out, you know as a subject being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2259.7s	2259.7	 Interpreted as you're being through the New Yorker right now in your story Jamath and I am through my business insider profile
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2265.8s	2265.8	 You know all these profiles that they do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2268.0s	2268.0	 They're interpreting your life when people could just tune into the podcast and hear us talk about it, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2273.6s	2273.6	 And it's like you can go direct to the source and listen to 34 episodes of all-in or you could read
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2278.7s	2278.7	 Some interpretation from somebody trying to get pages. Well, here's my here's my observation. The thing is that people who create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2285.6s	2285.6	 Artifacts on a real-time basis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2287.5s	2287.5	 So in many ways we have all collectively now started to create a weekly artifact of who we are as people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2294.0s	2294.0	 It leaves very little left over for interpretation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2297.2s	2297.2	 And so then unfortunately what happens is journalists trying to write content have to introduce some form of flourish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2304.3s	2304.3	 To stand out. Yeah, because if you're just repeating something that was said on the podcast or something that we said in a tweet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2311.5s	2311.5	 There's nothing left to talk about it's kind of already been said and so that's what creates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2315.4s	2315.4	 Boundary conditions for lying and it's what creates boundary conditions for mistruths
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2319.5s	2319.5	 And we've seen a handful of reporters back in the day fall, you know fall into that trap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2323.9s	2323.9	 We you know, there was a couple writers in the New York Times that got pinched for lying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2328.1s	2328.1	 It's gonna be harder and harder to lie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2330.1s	2330.1	 So in many in some ways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2331.1s	2331.1	 I'm actually pretty optimistic that that reputation management and truth will be easier to do in the future when this intermediary layer doesn't exist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2339.1s	2339.1	 But it'll take many other companies to do what coinbase is doing and recent us in this podcast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2344.7s	2344.7	 Us with our tweets and our memos and our posts. I think it's it's all in the good positive direction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2350.3s	2350.3	 Yeah, and and and and Armstrong in his in this blog talks about the gel man amnesia effect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2355.7s	2355.7	 Which we talked about on this pod before which is I saw that yeah, which is great. I love that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2360.3s	2360.3	 Because you know that the gel man amnesia is you read the newspaper about a topic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2364.2s	2364.2	 You know something about you see that 50% of it is just wrong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2367.6s	2367.6	 Then you turn the page to some other part of the newspaper say, you know world affairs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2372.1s	2372.1	 You don't know as much about and you just assume it's true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2374.6s	2374.6	 And we all know that the media is maybe 50% right about everything. And so yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2380.3s	2380.3	 I mean, so this is why we have to hear from experts directly. I think it's why it's the decentralization of media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2385.7s	2385.7	 It's why I think this like heavy-handed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2389.0s	2389.0	 Centralized censorship by big tech is so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2392.0s	2392.0	 Offensive and anachronistic is to try and control what everyone can say, especially when it later turns out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2398.6s	2398.6	 That you know big media gets so many things wrong like the lab leak theory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2402.9s	2402.9	 So it's it's this is definitely the way things are headed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2406.1s	2406.1	 I would like to invest some money to basically have freeberg a platform to explain science
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2411.3s	2411.3	 Well, that's right here freeberg. Tell us about the science of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2415.3s	2415.3	 NBA games and large gatherings in the age of vaccination
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2419.8s	2419.8	 I'm pretty sure you got covid this week jake-o. I'm pretty sure I definitely lost my voice at the nix games
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2424.9s	2424.9	 But I have to say this was pretty stunning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2427.9s	2427.9	 To go to a nix game have everybody in the arena show their vax card to get in. I suppose somebody could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2435.6s	2435.6	 Photocopy one or steal one, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2438.5s	2438.5	 It sounds like a lot of work and I don't know what the if there's any penalty for doing something like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2442.9s	2442.9	 But what when you see a full arena madison square garner everybody vaccinated freeberg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2448.1s	2448.1	 Do does it give you any pause as a scientist that this is not a good idea or this is too soon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2453.0s	2453.0	 Or do you think heck? Yes, this is what we should be doing proper risk assessment. Finally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2459.4s	2459.4	 No, we should do what we want to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2462.8s	2462.8	 They have it folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2465.7s	2465.7	 Do what you want to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2467.5s	2467.5	 There's a great science moment way to keep the freeberg ratio high
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2471.5s	2471.5	 That was supposed to be the science segue we're ready for a monologue. Let's go freeberg. Come on. Let's go freeberg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2476.5s	2476.5	 We're poking the tiger here freeberg. Why don't you tell this is something I thought was incredible amgen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2481.2s	2481.2	 This week at the end of this week got approval for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2483.8s	2483.8	 This really incredible drug that basically targets k-ras mutations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2488.5s	2488.5	 In lung cancer, which has been this body of cancer that has basically been somewhat intractable for a really long time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2494.8s	2494.8	 And these guys have cracked the code it looks like and now the drug is 18 000 a month I think but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2500.7s	2500.7	 You know that's that's for insurance to take care of but pretty incredible breakthrough that people are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2505.5s	2505.5	 Talking a lot about I don't know if you if you were tracking it. No, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2510.1s	2510.1	 I think that there were several other gene therapies there were several
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2515.7s	2515.7	 Drugs that got approval in the last like month
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2519.8s	2519.8	 um, one of which is this or actually was about two months ago this drug that um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2525.7s	2525.7	 Uh uses targeted car t therapy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2529.9s	2529.9	 Basically, you know, we all have t cells
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2532.9s	2532.9	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2533.9s	2533.9	 We can edit our own t cells now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2536.8s	2536.8	 using this car t therapy this is a series of techniques where you basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2541.8s	2541.8	 Reprogram your t cells genetically to go after a specific target in your body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2547.3s	2547.3	 And so there are now a whole series of car t therapies that are coming to market that are actually in market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2553.1s	2553.1	 You can go down and go get treatment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2555.7s	2555.7	 Uh today for several these car t therapies that you know, not too long ago were really difficult to kind of understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2561.9s	2561.9	 Uh, you know being real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2564.3s	2564.3	 They take your t cells out of your blood, you know, so you go and you get your blood drawn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2568.5s	2568.5	 A couple weeks later you come back to the doctor. They've taken the t cells out of your blood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2572.5s	2572.5	 They re-engineer them the way they re-engineer is really interesting. They basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2576.5s	2576.5	 Use this technique where they zap them with electricity and it gets this gene editing in there and then they get edited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2581.9s	2581.9	 And then they put those t cells back into your in your body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2586.0s	2586.0	 Uh, it takes about an hour to get them reinjected back into your body and then they do their job and they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2590.5s	2590.5	 In many cases are being used to target cancer cells. It's very specific receptors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2594.7s	2594.7	 So now the t cell has been programmed to go find that cancer cell receptor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2599.1s	2599.1	 They hit the cancer cell receptor bind to it and then eliminate that cancer cell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2603.5s	2603.5	 so essentially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2605.2s	2605.2	 In in plain english, you're putting this super t cell back on the body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2609.3s	2609.3	 It goes through the blood and then it finds something far in that shouldn't be there like a virus or cancer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2615.3s	2615.3	 Anything you want bacteria whatever you want it to find and it snipes it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2619.4s	2619.4	 But yeah what it does remember it's it's looking for a specific protein and that protein for example can be expressed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2626.0s	2626.0	 Only on the surface of specific cancer cells
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2628.9s	2628.9	 So if you found certain cancer cells that you have a cancer and we know that there's a specific protein that shows up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2634.5s	2634.5	 On the surface of that cancer which is common in many cancers because they all follow very similar kind of you know mutations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2640.8s	2640.8	 You can end up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2642.2s	2642.2	 Targeting that cancer cell and only that cancer cell and your your t cells go to work and they go and wipe it up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2647.7s	2647.7	 I think the breakthrough this week was in multiple myeloma and thyroid cancer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2651.9s	2651.9	 Yeah, there's a multiple myeloma one, which was a bluebird bioproduct. Yeah, and then I think it got picked up by um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2658.7s	2658.7	 bristol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2660.1s	2660.1	 Uh or someone else picked it up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2662.1s	2662.1	 So they basically paid the fee and they run their own good manufacturing practice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2667.4s	2667.4	 Uh facility where your blood is shipped to them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2670.9s	2670.9	 They do all the gene editing with your own t cells in this facility and they ship it back to your doctor and it gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2675.0s	2675.0	 Re-injected back into you. There are 600 car t cell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2680.3s	2680.3	 Is that what it's called car space t cell? Yeah, so car stands for chimeric antigen receptor and that is the little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2687.0s	2687.0	 Call it think about it as like a seeker that's on the outside of your t cell it goes and it finds a specific
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2691.3s	2691.3	 Thing it's trying to bind to and so you're reprogramming your t cell to have a specific
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2696.6s	2696.6	 Receptor and then as soon as it finds that that as soon as that receptor binds to the correct protein that's looking for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2703.3s	2703.3	 Boom that that cell that it binds to gets wiped out. Are we going to talk about the crazy media mergers and spin-outs that are happening because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2710.9s	2710.9	 It seems like just in the last 90 days the entire industry is rewiring itself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2715.7s	2715.7	 And it's kind of a pretty significant set of transactions that are underway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2719.7s	2719.7	 Amazon is buying mgm which owns most importantly james bond james bond has done 20 billion dollars in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2727.4s	2727.4	 adjusted revenue for their movies and you can obviously see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2731.9s	2731.9	 Many different backstories and television shows around the james bond. So this is kind of in my mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2737.3s	2737.3	 Of that eight or nine billion. They spent six billions on the franchise for james bond so that bezos can play james bond
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2743.5s	2743.5	 Obviously why he retired if you take a zoom out, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2747.3s	2747.3	 Several years ago you guys may remember, you know early 2000s into the mid, you know, uh aughts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2753.5s	2753.5	 Um all the telcos started freaking out. Um, because they were sorry all the media companies were freaking out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2760.4s	2760.4	 Because their controlled points of distribution which were network television and then their cable television stations and the movie theaters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2767.3s	2767.3	 We're getting disintermediated by the internet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2769.3s	2769.3	 So all these internet companies showed up like youtube and netflix and were going direct to consumer where consumers were not getting access to content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2776.7s	2776.7	 Directly without the control channels that the media companies controlled at the same time the telcos were freaking out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2783.1s	2783.1	 Because it turns out people didn't need cell phones anymore or need phone lines anymore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2786.9s	2786.9	 What they needed was internet access and internet access was quickly commoditizing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2790.6s	2790.6	 So the telcos were like holy crap being in the business of providing internet service not a great business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2796.0s	2796.0	 We need to be making more value per user per year than we're going to be able to make charging them for internet access
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2801.7s	2801.7	 So the telco started buying up media companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2804.7s	2804.7	 This is what verizon and others did and the media companies and at&t and the media so remember verizon bought aol and yahu
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2812.6s	2812.6	 Uh at&t bought time warner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2814.9s	2814.9	 And then the media companies the old school media companies that were kind of like still decided not to sell and to stay on their own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2820.6s	2820.6	 They decided well, we got to go internet, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2822.6s	2822.6	 So we got to figure out how to be on the internet and compete in this world where companies like netflix
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2826.3s	2826.3	 And amazon are going direct to consumers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2828.5s	2828.5	 And um, you know, they all started building their own internet services and so now you got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2834.1s	2834.1	 HBO max hulu
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2836.1s	2836.1	 And you know hulu was a big one and meanwhile the tech companies that went direct to consumers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2840.4s	2840.4	 They're realizing, you know, what if these media companies aren't going to play ball? We better get our own media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2843.8s	2843.8	 We got to get apple tv. Yeah, and so then they started licensing buying funding and building their own media companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2851.4s	2851.4	 And so there's a total reorientation that's underway now. What's interesting in the last couple weeks is verizon decided
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2856.3s	2856.3	 You know what? We can't be in the media business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2857.9s	2857.9	 We're not very good at it and they spun it out and they're selling aol yahu
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2862.6s	2862.6	 And then meanwhile this really interesting deal is at&t gave up on owning time warner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2867.6s	2867.6	 And so it turns out that the telcos who thought that they could own the media and monetize it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2872.0s	2872.0	 You know what? It's just a pain in the butt. It's another business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2874.5s	2874.5	 We can't really figure out how to add value to our subscriber base with these products
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2878.0s	2878.0	 They're gonna have to exist on their own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2879.3s	2879.3	 We don't know how to run them because we're not media guys and they're spinning out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2881.9s	2881.9	 So now the telcos the interesting question to ask is what are they going to do next?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2885.7s	2885.7	 What's the next move for them because they got to keep growing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2888.1s	2888.1	 Meanwhile, the tech companies and the media companies are just like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2891.6s	2891.6	 And there's 50 subscription services each with their own silo and vulcanization of content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2896.0s	2896.0	 And we're all going to have to choose as consumers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2898.1s	2898.1	 Do I want hbo max or paramount plus or you know the the bundle I get from concast and it's going to be a nasty battle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2904.1s	2904.1	 for the next 10 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2905.7s	2905.7	 Where you and where you want content you're gonna have to go pick and choose. Who do you want to buy content from?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2910.7s	2910.7	 And so yeah, I have a theory. I think consolidation happens when markets don't matter anymore and are getting commoditized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2918.4s	2918.4	 And what I would say about all of this what it shows me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2922.3s	2922.3	 Is that we're now transferring to the phase of the market where it's all about cost of capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2927.5s	2927.5	 And right now the only person that actually understood that was netflix
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2931.6s	2931.6	 And netflix issued billions of dollars of debt and they've started to finance every piece of content under the sun
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2939.0s	2939.0	 And being small and trying to compete against netflix was not possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2944.6s	2944.6	 And now we're in that part of the market where content is actually not that important because there is an enormous diversity of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2951.1s	2951.1	 So no one single person can really corner that market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2955.2s	2955.2	 And so then it becomes how much can you make and how cheaply can you make it and there scale matters?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2961.4s	2961.4	 so I could think like what this shows me back to sort of what we talked about before on the other part about like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2967.3s	2967.3	 Facts and truth is this is part of a much broader
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2970.6s	2970.6	 you know media puzzle that's becoming more obvious, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2974.8s	2974.8	 Traditional outlets that push top-down content is kind of yesterday's news and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2981.0s	2981.0	 What it's being replaced by is more and better forms of user-generated content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2986.0s	2986.0	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2987.1s	2987.1	 highly commoditized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2989.0s	2989.0	 Professional content and in all of that the economics are going away. So I don't if you if you if you are not sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2997.0s	2997.0	 Go and look inside of tik tok
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=2999.4s	2999.4	 the content that individual people create inside of tik tok is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3003.3s	3003.3	 unbelievably good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3004.9s	3004.9	 And they are training an entire generation of kids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3009.6s	3009.6	 to consume content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3011.7s	3011.7	 15 seconds 30 seconds at a time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3014.3s	3014.3	 Which has huge implications by the way for how they consume music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3017.0s	3017.0	 So for example, if you guys like look inside a tik tok and then go to youtube and look at the most popular videos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3022.4s	3022.4	 The same and same thing with spotify. It's 15 second clips now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3026.3s	3026.3	 No, you know these kids want to listen to the hook of a song and then they won't listen to it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3030.5s	3030.5	 I I see how my kids use it and it's crazy because like they get addicted to a hook on tik tok
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3034.8s	3034.8	 They try to go to youtube to learn the lyrics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3036.6s	3036.6	 They only want to learn the lyrics for the part that's in the tik tok bus and then they move on bus a challenge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3040.9s	3040.9	 Yes, whatever it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3042.3s	3042.3	 And so the the point of all of that is that content costs are going to continue to go down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3046.3s	3046.3	 Which means the economics are going to go down the margins are not that good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3049.9s	3049.9	 Um, and so it's all just a commodity that almost doesn't matter. I don't know about that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3054.0s	3054.0	 I think for the top tier ip like you can't displace a disney
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3058.2s	3058.2	 And they are growing portfolio of ip and those things are high margin and you know having 250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3063.7s	3063.7	 Having 250 to 500 000 500 million people paying you monthly has never existed in the history of humanity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3071.0s	3071.0	 There's never been an at scale service like this before the closest was verizon at&t when they hit 100 million members
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3077.1s	3077.1	 I'm not disputing that people won't pay 9.99. What i'm disputing is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3081.8s	3081.8	 The denominator of what they're paying for is increasing so fast that no one piece of content matters. Jason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3086.6s	3086.6	 No, the idea we agree with that collections matter, right? So the ip of marvel disney
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3091.7s	3091.7	 Pixar put together disney's been perfect case study, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3094.8s	3094.8	 Like pick disney launched this thing with no direct to consumer relationships with when they launched disney plus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3100.4s	3100.4	 What do they have now 60 million subscribers or something to 100 now 100 million subscribers, which is incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3106.2s	3106.2	 You guys have kids my kids watch this stuff on you will have it for the rest of our lives over and over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3111.1s	3111.1	 They'll put on frigging moana. I cannot tell you how many times i've watched the seashore scene of moana
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3115.4s	3115.4	 They want to watch the beginning they want to watch the middle part
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3118.0s	3118.0	 It's just like infinitely reusable content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3120.3s	3120.3	 And so disney's content library is so powerful for that particular demographic basically the demographic of anyone with children
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3126.7s	3126.7	 That it's an instant on kind of moment these other guys like paramount plus and you know hbo's obviously got some special content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3133.3s	3133.3	 But it shows how much content matters, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3135.7s	3135.7	 The quality of the content for the demographic is so key for this to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3140.3s	3140.3	 All these media companies that have kind of a broad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3144.0s	3144.0	 Dithered, you know library of half quality half good kind of content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3148.2s	3148.2	 They're gonna struggle man because they're not gonna get I also feel like they're ringing a little too much out of it with this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3153.0s	3153.0	 too much content production there is like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3155.3s	3155.3	 50 shows about superheroes then there's like 50 shows that are like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3160.1s	3160.1	 You know meta commentary on the superhero shows. It's almost becoming exhausting like how many homeland?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3166.6s	3166.6	 Style shows are they're going to be how many soprano style shows are going to be game of throne?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3171.2s	3171.2	 I'm getting burnt out. I think you're I think you're making my point, which is that no one piece of content matters anymore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3176.5s	3176.5	 It's all the same. So my big takeaway from bezos buying mgm and these other, you know, m&a events is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3183.8s	3183.8	 It's less about the decline of content even though there are more and more options that are ever have been and therefore more competition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3190.5s	3190.5	 And it's more about the rising power and wealth and influence of big tech. I mean if you look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3196.0s	3196.0	 Throughout history whoever is buying studios in any given era
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3200.6s	3200.6	 They're the people with the money and power and they're seeking influence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3203.4s	3203.4	 It was g e buying nbc it was gulf and western buying paramount in the 1970s an oil and gas company or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3209.1s	3209.1	 Robert Evans kid stays in the picture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3211.3s	3211.3	 So that's right sony buying columbia in the 1980s when you had the era of the rising sun
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3216.7s	3216.7	 So whoever has the money and the power and seeking influence are the ones buying studios
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3221.2s	3221.2	 That's what bezos is doing right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3222.6s	3222.6	 but I think this time it is a little bit different in this sense that we're reaching an end state of digital convergence where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3230.3s	3230.3	 the um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3232.0s	3232.0	 Where content and the digital distribution are now reaching their kind of final state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3236.6s	3236.6	 And so I don't expect these studios once they're owned by big tech to ever go anywhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3241.0s	3241.0	 And I don't think they're going to be trading again every 10 years. I think this is the end state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3245.4s	3245.4	 Um amazon wants this library for their streaming service
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3249.5s	3249.5	 And I think that big tech is going to gobble up the rest of these libraries and that's where they're going to stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3254.2s	3254.2	 Do you think all media will end up in tech? Yeah, I mean I think I think I think big tech is going to eat hollywood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3259.6s	3259.6	 Look, we've been on this this path of convergence now since the mid 90s with the internet and the question was always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3266.2s	3266.2	 You know we knew that tech and hollywood were converging and and joining
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3271.7s	3271.7	 To more and more and the question would be on whose terms this final merger would take place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3277.0s	3277.0	 And I think that big tech now you just look at the market caps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3280.2s	3280.2	 There's so much bigger than the market caps of these studios that eight billion surrounding error
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3285.3s	3285.3	 It's a rounding error for bezos. I mean, it's one day's it's one day's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3289.4s	3289.4	 Revenue or whatever or less. So obviously big tech is going to win this battle. They are going to own hollywood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3295.3s	3295.3	 But except for the few guys that have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3297.7s	3297.7	 Scale to actually be successful like disney, right disney maybe hbo to some extent. We'll see how I mean look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3304.9s	3304.9	 Zaslav who runs uh this guy he's an incredible media guy and he gets it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3310.2s	3310.2	 But they could be like this discovery plus slash hbo plus whatever that combined business ends up looking like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3315.9s	3315.9	 That could be a competitor and there may be like there's two to three libraries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3318.8s	3318.8	 They're deep enough and strong enough to compete and stand on their own as a tech kind of platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3323.8s	3323.8	 But what's also really interesting is that all the telcos are exiting and what are they going to become right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3328.2s	3328.2	 It's clear what's interesting is they're not they're not tech companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3331.4s	3331.4	 That are fast are important, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3333.8s	3333.8	 So so so here's the thing with the telcos the telecom stack is is we know that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3338.0s	3338.0	 Tech is taking over hollywood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3339.4s	3339.4	 But the question is what part of the tech stack and what's happened is the part of the tech stack that has the direct relationship with the audience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3348.2s	3348.2	 Apple google amazon who aggregate millions and millions of consumers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3353.5s	3353.5	 They're the ones who should actually own the content because they are the ones delivering up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3358.7s	3358.7	 The content to the consumer and everybody else who's lower down in the stack who are just the pipes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3364.7s	3364.7	 They don't really have a claim on these libraries in this content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3371.9s	3371.9	 The pipes are valuable, but they're a commodity what elon is doing with starlink is going to disrupt them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3377.2s	3377.2	 I'm not saying they're not valuable, but they're not in a highly leveraged position to do anything with the content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3382.9s	3382.9	 They're going to keep increasing speed in order to keep you paying 30 bucks a month
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3386.6s	3386.6	 Because like now that they're out they realized you know what we can't we can't run media businesses and we can't monetize it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3391.0s	3391.0	 Well, what are they going to do because they can't just focus on faster bandwidth. Get us to gigabit. I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3396.2s	3396.2	 It doesn't matter. I mean like you guys are like you guys are so fucking old like you're just like talking about yesterday's news. Nobody cares
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3403.9s	3403.9	 This is what I mean consolidation in markets like this should tell you it's time to move on and focus on something else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3409.1s	3409.1	 This is a dead industry with no profit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3412.1s	3412.1	 So jamath what happens to at&t and what happens to bryton over the next 10 years? It doesn't matter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3417.2s	3417.2	 Well, I I agree. I agree with that part that it doesn't matter what happens to these telcos. They should be dumb pipes again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3422.0s	3422.0	 They're not in a leveraged position to create value around content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3425.6s	3425.6	 They never should have owned it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3426.7s	3426.7	 But I do think there is major major significance in amazon and apple and google and these other big tech companies owning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3434.6s	3434.6	 Hollywood because they have they're going to combine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3438.0s	3438.0	 The influence they already have with the influence of hollywood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3441.3s	3441.3	 And you already have again censorship on these tech platforms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3444.5s	3444.5	 Are they going to start censoring the type of content that hollywood produces?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3448.7s	3448.7	 I think these issues are going to get more and more important over time because so much control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3453.8s	3453.8	 Over our politics and society and culture are being concentrated in the hands of frankly our industry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3460.1s	3460.1	 But this is what I think about the other the other side of that coin is what we talked about before with respect to things like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3465.6s	3465.6	 Coinbase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3466.9s	3466.9	 While that's happening more and more people who have their own distribution are going direct. So let's just separate entertainment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3475.1s	3475.1	 and facts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3476.4s	3476.4	 From a fact perspective. I think we're seeing everything sort of become highly decentralized and I think that that's constructive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3482.8s	3482.8	 Now there'll be services that will be there to help us navigate but I think that's what's happening with respect to entertainment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3488.8s	3488.8	 I just think like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3490.3s	3490.3	 It was our generation was the last one that actually even cared about movies that cared about these tent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3495.7s	3495.7	 Productions that that cared about water cooler type conversations on a monday morning books novels kids will not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3502.8s	3502.8	 Understand what the hell we're talking about. They're like, what do you mean? You used to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3507.5s	3507.5	 Run into work on a monday. I don't want to go to the movies anymore. You think it's over. They couldn't care less
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3512.3s	3512.3	 Really? They play games. I still love going to the movies. They love video games
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3515.5s	3515.5	 Yeah, I mean video games are obviously like that, you know the combination of media tech and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3520.6s	3520.6	 They're just the kind of ultimate manifestation of where it's all and it's not just our kids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3525.5s	3525.5	 Just look at the monthly active usage numbers at roblox and epic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3529.6s	3529.6	 And for that, yeah, yeah, it's it's nuts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3532.3s	3532.3	 And so they are voting every day with their attention and at the end of the day the thing that has never been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3538.3s	3538.3	 Improved is the nut or increased is the number of hours in a day. So chamak your point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3543.5s	3543.5	 Your point on the telcos, you know as an investor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3546.0s	3546.0	 I own a bunch of Verizon and at&t stock if you were running that company, what would you do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3550.2s	3550.2	 I would quit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3551.5s	3551.5	 Okay, you might run it for capital and then buy assets. Oh wait, they did that you can't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3556.0s	3556.0	 Right, but here's the crazy stuff. What's left to do, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3559.4s	3559.4	 These businesses have had horrendous capital allocation for decades and the reason that they were allowed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3565.4s	3565.4	 Was that they were they were part of a culture of insiders. There were other ins where other insiders said that they were important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3572.1s	3572.1	 But as it turned out to individual users who are making usage decisions every day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3577.0s	3577.0	 They were not important at all and this is what we're learning that the emperor has no clothes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3581.6s	3581.6	 So while everybody was you know looking around themselves saying at&t is important and hey, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3587.6s	3587.6	 Let's go and like, you know buy all of these crazy old school media assets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3592.3s	3592.3	 Young people were like I use snapchat and tik tok and youtube and i'm done. Thanks. Goodbye talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3596.8s	3596.8	 Right and who owns those platforms? I mean you're right that professional content is being crowded out to some degree by amateur content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3604.5s	3604.5	 But now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3605.5s	3605.5	 The the big tech companies own the professional content or the studios for creating them and they own the the user generated platforms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3612.6s	3612.6	 That lets the amateurs create the content. So big tech now owns everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3616.6s	3616.6	 No, but you're seeing the next shooter drop because the thing that I think content creators haven't yet realized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3623.4s	3623.4	 And social media personalities and influencers haven't yet realized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3628.7s	3628.7	 Is how can I own my own distribution?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3632.3s	3632.3	 And monetize my relationship that feature of the web
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3637.5s	3637.5	 Will get figured out in our lifetime and that's starting to a patreon and then apple is now no no no spotify is doing pay content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3645.6s	3645.6	 People are doing stripe accounts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3647.6s	3647.6	 Direct with their fans. Those people are too old. They're not going to figure it out. What i'm saying is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3652.2s	3652.2	 There are going to be people who are teenagers today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3655.9s	3655.9	 Right or kids who will be teenagers in a decade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3658.8s	3658.8	 20-somethings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3660.2s	3660.2	 Who will figure this out for whom the idea that if you're a charlie demilio, right your tiktok's top biggest star with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3668.4s	3668.4	 120 odd million followers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3671.2s	3671.2	 That to go through an intermediary to talk to your people will not in the future make any sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3676.4s	3676.4	 And I think david that's that's where the the next thing will change. I just think it's unreliable to expect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3683.8s	3683.8	 laser beam mr. B's charlie demilio all these people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3687.8s	3687.8	 To continue to go through the no because they have they have such guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3691.6s	3691.6	 I think they could go direct some of those guys could go direct now that they're huge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3695.1s	3695.1	 But it's it's no different than building a name on the new york times and then starting your own sub stack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3699.8s	3699.8	 It's going to happen. Yeah, but you can't go viral and you can't get discovered unless you participate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3706.0s	3706.0	 In these platforms, you can use the platform and you can have a new relationship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3711.2s	3711.2	 You will build scale on a platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3713.3s	3713.3	 And then you'll go on your own because you'll want to control and monetize your own relationship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3717.2s	3717.2	 It's it is what these folks have done meaning like how kylie jenner and kim kardashian had built incredible scale and wealth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3724.3s	3724.3	 Yeah is effectively through that they build scale through instagram and twitter and wherever tv show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3730.2s	3730.2	 Now the only thing that they haven't done is they've monetized it through offline goods
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3734.2s	3734.2	 But if somebody figures out how to monetize it through an online relationship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3739.0s	3739.0	 Then what you're really doing is you're learning how to build scale in an established platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3743.3s	3743.3	 And then you on ramp to something else that's also online and you go from there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3747.1s	3747.1	 To think that it won't get figured out. I think is being that it's being figured out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3750.4s	3750.4	 It's being figured out right now. The street is figuring out there's something called ghost, which is like an open source version of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3755.6s	3755.6	 Substack it is an open source version of sub stack and people are building direct relationships and doing their own patreon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3762.1s	3762.1	 And if you leave sub stack you get to take your stripe account with you you use your stripe account
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3766.8s	3766.8	 So now it's portable you can go on sub stack for a year leave and keep all your subscribers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3771.2s	3771.2	 I think this solution will get figured out through the crypto community
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3775.4s	3775.4	 And the reason is because that is by definition to your point jason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3779.2s	3779.2	 Fundamentally distributed and tied to a payment and a store of value because that's what effectively this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3785.1s	3785.1	 It's like where is the value of somebody's reputation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3788.7s	3788.7	 And right now we don't have a way of measuring it and you can you can put that on chain in some way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3793.3s	3793.3	 I don't claim to know how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3795.4s	3795.4	 But I mean people have talked about this is all these different. I hope I hope that happens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3799.6s	3799.6	 I hope that crypto figures out a way to to create decentralized social networks and all the rest of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3804.0s	3804.0	 But it doesn't exist yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3805.2s	3805.2	 And the only way that mr beast or charlie demilio or any of these people became stars is they went viral
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3811.6s	3811.6	 On youtube or tiktok or insta they on up on a big tech platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3816.8s	3816.8	 And so right now the strategy is going to be doing both you you use the platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3821.1s	3821.1	 To work and then you power they have all the power right now because if they deny you access to one of these platforms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3826.8s	3826.8	 Oh, you're talking about trump who cares about trump. I'm not talking about trump. You're talking about trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3830.8s	3830.8	 You're so completely lost your mind. Nobody wants trump in their life, but you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZG89pDzzY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=102&t=3835.1s	3835.1	 Okay, you're the one who mentioned his name. You're the one with trump on the on the brain. What are you talking about?
