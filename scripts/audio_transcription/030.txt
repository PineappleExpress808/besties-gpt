https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=78.3s	78.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=79.3s	79.3	 Breaking news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=80.3s	80.3	 Biden has announced his capital gains tax hike.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=86.3s	86.3	 I don't think this impacts any of us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=88.3s	88.3	 but Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=92.3s	92.3	 rate for wealthy individuals from 20% to not 25,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=98.3s	98.3	 not 28, 39.6% to help pay for the social spending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=104.3s	104.3	 and in equality for those earning one million or more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=108.3s	108.3	 So nobody on this call.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=109.3s	109.3	 Federal tax rates could be as high as 43.4%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=112.3s	112.3	 The capital gains increase would raise 370 billion over a decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=116.3s	116.3	 Yada yada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=117.3s	117.3	 For New Yorkers, the combined state and federal capital gains
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=121.3s	121.3	 rate could be as high as 52.22%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=124.3s	124.3	 In Californians, 56.7%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=129.3s	129.3	 Biden has previously warned that those earning over 400,000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=132.3s	132.3	 can expect to pay more in taxes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=134.3s	134.3	 This was just breaking news a couple of hours
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=137.3s	137.3	 before we started the pod and the stock market is down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=143.3s	143.3	 and people are freaking out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=145.3s	145.3	 Well, J. Cal, I want to hear your take on this actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=148.3s	148.3	 I want to start with your take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=150.3s	150.3	 Why didn't you tell me Biden was going to do this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=152.3s	152.3	 I would have voted for Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=153.3s	153.3	 You didn't tell me this was going to hit me so hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=156.3s	156.3	 No, J. Cal was ranting on this topic 15 minutes ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=160.3s	160.3	 We were talking and I'm like, dummy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=162.3s	162.3	 what did you think was going to happen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=165.3s	165.3	 He's saying they're going off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=167.3s	167.3	 He's saying they're going off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=168.3s	168.3	 It's like, what did you expect?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=169.3s	169.3	 Just before we get into it, we should do a quick primer on what this means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=172.3s	172.3	 So capital gains taxes are the taxes you pay when you make an investment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=176.3s	176.3	 and you sell that investment at a profit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=178.3s	178.3	 You pay a tax on the profit you make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=180.3s	180.3	 And there's a difference between capital gains on the short term,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=183.3s	183.3	 which means less than one year, and long term,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=186.3s	186.3	 which means you've had the investment for more than a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=188.3s	188.3	 So economic policy historically has dictated that having a low capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=192.3s	192.3	 gains tax rate relative to what an income tax rate might make,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=196.3s	196.3	 might be, incentivizes people to make long term investments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=200.3s	200.3	 And it gets more money moving in the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=202.3s	202.3	 And as a result, the economy will grow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=205.3s	205.3	 And so the idea of increasing the long term capital gains tax from 20%,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=210.3s	210.3	 which it currently is, to 40%, is a real striking economic policy shift
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=216.3s	216.3	 rationalized as we're going to use this money for social spending.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=221.3s	221.3	 But I think the historical context and what this is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=224.3s	224.3	 is really important as we get into the conversation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=227.3s	227.3	 And just speaking historically, the maximum tax rate on long term capital gains
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=232.3s	232.3	 got up to 40%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=235.3s	235.3	 Sachs, you probably have the history on this in 1978 for a year, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=239.3s	239.3	 Or like 76 to 78.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=241.3s	241.3	 And then it's been largely 15 to 20% for the last 20 years or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=246.3s	246.3	 And so to jump up, and prior to that, in the early part of the 20th century,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=250.3s	250.3	 it was like 25% pretty consistently for a long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=253.3s	253.3	 So to jump up to 40% is a really big shift.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=255.3s	255.3	 And there's a lot of debate around the economic implications of doing this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=259.3s	259.3	 I thought that was important. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=261.3s	261.3	 Let's take a step back and actually see the forest from the trees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=264.3s	264.3	 And the forest from the trees is that I don't think Biden thinks that it's a credible plan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=272.3s	272.3	 in as much as I probably think he needs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=277.3s	277.3	 This is like it's performative because it was a lot larger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=282.3s	282.3	 The number, the headline number was a lot larger than what people were whispering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=287.3s	287.3	 was going to be the number, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=289.3s	289.3	 It was supposed to be like in the low 30s or maybe kind of like 33, 34.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=294.3s	294.3	 And then all of a sudden, to come out of 39.6, I think it's almost like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=299.3s	299.3	 OK, he's giving the pound of flesh to the left, kind of like woke mob of the Democratic Party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=309.3s	309.3	 who probably doesn't understand how capitalism works in the first place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=313.3s	313.3	 and doesn't care because they're not participants in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=316.3s	316.3	 Now, my reaction is I don't think it's going to pass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=319.3s	319.3	 I think it's going to be really tough to get done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=321.3s	321.3	 And I think it probably, you know, maybe there's a watered down version,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=325.3s	325.3	 but I think with this version, I'm not super worried about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=329.3s	329.3	 And then it just comes back to the same thing over and over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=332.3s	332.3	 The fewer, the number of people that get to participate in the growth and see the upside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=337.3s	337.3	 the more there are that just wants to just kind of, you know, tear it all down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=341.3s	341.3	 And so, I don't know, it's just yet another signal that we have these structural issues to fix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=346.3s	346.3	 It's not reasonable that a few people get super rich and everybody else gets left on the sidelines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=351.3s	351.3	 Sax, what are your thoughts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=352.3s	352.3	 It's not going to pass, but it's not going to pass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=354.3s	354.3	 Is it an opening salvo where he wants to get to 32, so he's starting at 39?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=359.3s	359.3	 I think it could pass because I think they're planning to do this tax increase as part of the second infrastructure bill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=367.3s	367.3	 It's not really an infrastructure bill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=368.3s	368.3	 They're calling it human infrastructure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=370.3s	370.3	 We've talked about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=371.3s	371.3	 Infrastructure is one of the last categories of federal spending that's still popular.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=375.3s	375.3	 So, they're rebranding a bunch of social programs as human infrastructure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=379.3s	379.3	 I think that bill will pass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=381.3s	381.3	 I don't know if the rate will stay at 39.6, but I think there will be a big increase clearly in the cap gains rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=389.3s	389.3	 I mean, I think it's worth remembering how it got to 20%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=394.3s	394.3	 It got to 20% because Bill Clinton lowered it from 28 to 20 as part of an overall package of tax reforms that he did in the sort of the mid-90s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=407.3s	407.3	 That led to some of the best years of economic performance, GDP growth in the US, productivity growth, deficit reduction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=416.3s	416.3	 I think we are experimenting with breaking something that's been working, I think, pretty well since the Reagan-Clinton years, which is to have reasonably low taxes on capital formation and investment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=434.3s	434.3	 I think it's a category error to treat capital gains or to think about it just as income.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=439.3s	439.3	 You have to remember that all of this money has already been taxed once, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=443.3s	443.3	 So, you make the money the first time as income.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=446.3s	446.3	 You earn it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=447.3s	447.3	 You pay tax on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=448.3s	448.3	 Then you decide to save some of it and invest it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=451.3s	451.3	 And then you get taxed again on that amount.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=453.3s	453.3	 And so, capital gains is a form of double taxation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=457.3s	457.3	 That was the original reason, one of the reasons to have a different tax rate for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=462.3s	462.3	 I think that this risk kind of messing up the economic recovery that's really underway already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=469.3s	469.3	 By the way, think about what just happens to any organization that has to pay cap gains, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=474.3s	474.3	 It's not just individuals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=476.3s	476.3	 Last time I checked, organizations aren't exempt from cap gains, for-profit organizations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=482.3s	482.3	 And I don't exactly know what they will do as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=489.3s	489.3	 You're putting a lot of people under a huge strain when you double the effective rate of return.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=495.3s	495.3	 So, if you're, for example, a pension fund, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=500.3s	500.3	 And you have an enormous investment in a private equity fund or a hedge fund,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=505.3s	505.3	 part of these things is that they're these complete pass-through vehicles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=509.3s	509.3	 And so, as long as you've structured yourself in a way where you don't have to pay that tax, I guess you're indifferent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=516.3s	516.3	 But if you're any organization or institution or a person or collection of people that bears that tax,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=523.3s	523.3	 all of a sudden, your returns have been basically cut in half.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=528.3s	528.3	 That's pretty nuts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=530.3s	530.3	 Let's talk about the average, Joe, for a second, or Jane, as it were.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=534.3s	534.3	 401Ks would take a hit here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=537.3s	537.3	 And then when you go to your retirement and you have to liquidate them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=540.3s	540.3	 You don't pay tax on the 401K gains.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=542.3s	542.3	 Yeah, you don't pay tax on the 401K gains during the investment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=546.3s	546.3	 Otherwise, your portfolio, because 401K is going to be a small amount you can contribute to every year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=550.3s	550.3	 So, retirees who happen to have stock market gains or cryptocurrency, people trading that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=555.3s	555.3	 Yeah, you'll basically pay the same as income tax as opposed to paying a lower tax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=560.3s	560.3	 So, would a...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=561.3s	561.3	 It'll diminish investment, Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=563.3s	563.3	 It's exactly what David says, which is that on a marginal basis, what will happen is inflation probably goes up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=568.3s	568.3	 because people just decide to consume rather than invest because they think, well, what's the point?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=573.3s	573.3	 There's already risk that I bear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=575.3s	575.3	 And so, the earliest risk assets, the riskiest ones that we all participate in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=580.3s	580.3	 which is early stage venture and company formation, you may not be thinking about the capital gains rate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=586.3s	586.3	 but it's implicit in the returns that you're expecting for the risk and the time you're going to take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=590.3s	590.3	 And we've been trained to feel that rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=594.3s	594.3	 And if you double that rate from 20 to 40, I suspect that there's a lot of people whose risk tolerance changes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=601.3s	601.3	 and they're going to feel their after-tax gains differently and they'll wonder to themselves, is this worth it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=607.3s	607.3	 And then I think what happens as a result is entrepreneurship drags.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=612.3s	612.3	 I don't know if anybody's done an analysis, but I suspect part of the reason why America is such an amazing sink for capital,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=620.3s	620.3	 it absorbs capital all around the world, is that you've created incentives that get people very excited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=626.3s	626.3	 because they think they can get rewarded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=628.3s	628.3	 If you take those rewards away, I think the implications are much bigger than just the cap gains rates here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=633.3s	633.3	 because as the people change their behavior, then the capital formation pools outside of the United States change their behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=639.3s	639.3	 and the whole thing has a knock-on effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=641.3s	641.3	 And it was more muted in Clinton. It was less muted in 78.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=646.3s	646.3	 It basically didn't exist in the 40s and 50s, but it is a huge force today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=651.3s	651.3	 I mean, we are an indebted nation that owes money to all kinds of countries around the world, including China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=656.3s	656.3	 We're supposed to generate growth and pay the back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=659.3s	659.3	 And where will the growth come from if LPs don't want to back venture funds or venture funds?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=664.3s	664.3	 But let's be honest and direct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=668.3s	668.3	 Are any of you guys going to change your investment behavior if the cap gains tax goes to 40%?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=674.3s	674.3	 No, but there'll be less of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=677.3s	677.3	 So, look, anything...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=679.3s	679.3	 Yes, my behavior will change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=681.3s	681.3	 I think my behavior will change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=682.3s	682.3	 How will it change?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=684.3s	684.3	 It's exactly what David said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=685.3s	685.3	 So, I just put in $100 million into a climate change company two weeks ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=689.3s	689.3	 Under this promise, I could only put in 50.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=693.3s	693.3	 So, there's 50 million less progress that's going to happen on that business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=697.3s	697.3	 I'm not sure that that's the right answer for what that company is trying to do in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=702.3s	702.3	 And the way it will change...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=703.3s	703.3	 You're saying the profits you would have had from before are diminished in half.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=707.3s	707.3	 Therefore, you would only have half as much money to invest as an investor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=711.3s	711.3	 Right. So, however way you want to cut it, whether it's like the 10 companies gets cut down into five,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=716.3s	716.3	 or the five, 10 companies that I invest in get half my money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=719.3s	719.3	 The point is at some point, the money starts to run out, not just for me, but for everybody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=725.3s	725.3	 Yeah. Basically, at the end of the day, the money goes into the hands of, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=728.3s	728.3	 government legislators and administrators to decide how that money gets spent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=733.3s	733.3	 And it's not in the hands of capitalist investors to decide where to invest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=738.3s	738.3	 That's the fundamental kind of shift that's going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=741.3s	741.3	 Right. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=742.3s	742.3	 Capital has been taken out of the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=744.3s	744.3	 Risk capital has been taken out of the economy and it's now going to be, you know, spent by government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=749.3s	749.3	 Look, anything that you tax, you punish and disincentivize,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=753.3s	753.3	 and anything you subsidize, you create an incentive for there to be more of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=758.3s	758.3	 And, you know, so this is just, we always talk about these things in terms of who they're going to hurt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=763.3s	763.3	 Is it that this only falls on the backs of rich people?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=767.3s	767.3	 So, we shouldn't care. But the real question is, what is this going to do to the economy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=771.3s	771.3	 And, you know, I think we've talked in previous podcasts, the last one that we have with Brad Gerstner,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=775.3s	775.3	 it feels like everything in the American system is kind of broken, except for one thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=780.3s	780.3	 which is this sort of opportunity economy that's been created by risk capital, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=785.3s	785.3	 And people creating new companies, you know, like these big, stultifying political corporations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=790.3s	790.3	 the S&P 500 are completely broken, government's completely broken, the federal debt is out of control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=796.3s	796.3	 The media is broken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=798.3s	798.3	 Everything in America is either broken or needs to be revitalized or reformed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=802.3s	802.3	 except one thing is working really well, which is risk capital and its allocation to founders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=809.3s	809.3	 who have nothing but a good idea, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=812.3s	812.3	 And when all of a sudden you double the cap gains rate, that is an attack on that opportunity society.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=818.3s	818.3	 Now, I think there is a legitimate conversation to be had about how do we spread this sort of system of opportunity to more and more people?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=826.3s	826.3	 I think like Brad framed it really well in the last episode, like how do we get more people involved in that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=830.3s	830.3	 I would submit the answer has a lot to do with school choice and charter schools, giving people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=835.3s	835.3	 everyone in this country deserves to have a first rate education.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=838.3s	838.3	 And so that is a very legitimate conversation to have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=841.3s	841.3	 But I think to have punitive taxation on it is I think it risk breaking that last thing that is working so well in the American system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=850.3s	850.3	 I think it's really well said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=851.3s	851.3	 And I think this is going to take redomiciling to another level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=855.3s	855.3	 I mean, if you're in New York or California right now and you were thinking about Wyoming or Utah or Texas or Florida,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=863.3s	863.3	 I mean, this kind of makes the decision for you if it does go to 40 and because that's what you could actually meet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=871.3s	871.3	 Would you get to neutral if you left?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=873.3s	873.3	 And so I remember I remember when I moved to the United States in 2000, the marginal tax bracket that I was in and I was making maybe, you know, a hundred.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=883.3s	883.3	 No, I was making 80 or 90 thousand dollars a year was 55 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=890.3s	890.3	 And I remember coming to the United States and seeing my after my take home pay my first paycheck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=896.3s	896.3	 And I was shocked because I was like, you know, I was paying maybe 36 percent all blended in federal and local at the time or state at the time in California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=904.3s	904.3	 And slowly, slowly, it's creeping up with if you play it out today where we are, plus New York State just passed laws,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=911.3s	911.3	 you're going to be sort of in the 50 to 55 percent, almost upwards of 56 percent for certain folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=917.3s	917.3	 And maybe the answer is that's the right thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=920.3s	920.3	 But I think we have to acknowledge that there's going to be a bunch of unintended consequences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=924.3s	924.3	 So maybe the intended consequence is to actually create more equality between the richest few and, you know, not even the poorest, frankly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=934.3s	934.3	 because but it'll just be the richest few and the next richest few, quite honestly, because, like, you know, the investing class is still a small number of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=942.3s	942.3	 But the unintended consequences of that decision, I think, is what exactly what David said, which is that over the next five or 10 year period,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=949.3s	949.3	 you will at a practical level see less investment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=954.3s	954.3	 And the only way to make that whole is if the government then takes all that money and all of a sudden allocates it from their own coffers back into the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=962.3s	962.3	 And we know that that's not going to happen. Well, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=965.3s	965.3	 That's just going to be riddled with waste and graft and corruption.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=968.3s	968.3	 So unfortunately, the setup is that, you know, you're going to really impact entrepreneurship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=973.3s	973.3	 And then and then I wondered to myself, by the way, guys, like, what was the actual goal of this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=979.3s	979.3	 Meaning there was 20 or 30 guys that were just making so much money on their equity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=984.3s	984.3	 But then that's then then we need to blame like the these lists like the Forbes billionaires list, because those are inaccurate because a lot of these stuff is like unrealized,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=994.3s	994.3	 Realized paper gains. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=997.3s	997.3	 And so they're not they're not paying any capital gains because they haven't sold anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1001.3s	1001.3	 And most of these guys that are Uber, Uber rich, you know, have no desire to sell because it's for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1006.3s	1006.3	 It's a control issue to sell. I'm not sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1008.3s	1008.3	 I'm not sure the consequence of taxing Uber rich people is the true motivation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1014.3s	1014.3	 I think for some people, maybe it is. But if we just take a step back, I mean, a year ago, the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1021.3s	1021.3	 debt level was significantly lower than it is today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1024.3s	1024.3	 We've taken on a tremendous amount of federal debt to fund a series of programs that we believe we're going to kind of keep the American population employed and keep our economy moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1036.3s	1036.3	 That was a massive burden we accrued and in the past year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1040.3s	1040.3	 Ultimately, over time, the only way to kind of support this this new federal budget and, you know, this new servicing costs that we've taken on at the government level, you really only have kind of like three options.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1053.3s	1053.3	 Option one is you're going to continue to raise more debt and massively kind of inflate everything and the dollar declines in value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1060.3s	1060.3	 Option two is to reduce spending, which means starting to cut these programs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1064.3s	1064.3	 And option three is to raise taxes. And it's pretty clear that option one is one where we're kind of already at the economic limit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1071.3s	1071.3	 Option two is going to be very hard to swallow at a time like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1075.3s	1075.3	 So you can't just cut spending right now across the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1078.3s	1078.3	 So many aspects of the U.S. economy and so many individuals in the United States are dependent on the federal government for support.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1085.3s	1085.3	 And so option three is the only real one that's left on the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1089.3s	1089.3	 And so then the question is, who are you taxing? You're not going to go tax the people that are struggling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1093.3s	1093.3	 You're going to tax the corporations and the wealthy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1096.3s	1096.3	 And the capital gains tax is the one place where you can kind of say, look, the tax rate that you're paying today is half of what an income tax rate would be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1103.3s	1103.3	 If you were earning that as income, let's get it to be fair and even.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1106.3s	1106.3	 And I think just just to argue this other side, like there's a motivation, there's a point of view where this is coming from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1112.3s	1112.3	 It's not just let's go tax the rich, screw the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1115.3s	1115.3	 It's that we find ourselves in a circumstance where we need to do one of those three things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1119.3s	1119.3	 The most rational to do is to or the most kind of sensible politically to do is to increase taxation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1127.3s	1127.3	 And this is the first place to go, the most obvious place to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1130.3s	1130.3	 It's not because so when you think about like, so, for example, like, you know, you would say, OK, who are the folks that we're talking about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1137.3s	1137.3	 There can be entrepreneurs that are building companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1140.3s	1140.3	 Again, they're never selling, so they're never going to pay these taxes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1143.3s	1143.3	 Like, it's not the case that Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg is all of a sudden going to write a 40 billion dollar check because that's that's not how much they make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1151.3s	1151.3	 That may be how much they're worth, but they will never sell a single share unless they have to to fund some other project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1157.3s	1157.3	 In which case, those three things would you do tomorrow?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1160.3s	1160.3	 So so so what I was going to say is so and then and then you look at somebody else like maybe you say, oh, well, you know, the people that manage money, like, let's go after those guys, because like those guys shouldn't be, you know, rich.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1171.3s	1171.3	 But then the problem is those guys are already paying W-2 income.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1174.3s	1174.3	 They're already paying nominal income tax rates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1176.3s	1176.3	 That's how the entire hedge fund industry works right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1179.3s	1179.3	 You know, you get paid in current income.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1182.3s	1182.3	 And so, OK, so you're not getting their money because they're already paying at the prevailing rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1186.3s	1186.3	 So, again, this goes back to if you actually trace the problem and see who it affects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1192.3s	1192.3	 It's exactly what David said. It's these folks that are in the middle that are actually putting the money to work that are trying to invest in things that now have a very different return profile.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1200.3s	1200.3	 And you're right, the core business that they do, they may still keep doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1204.3s	1204.3	 But then all of the incremental things in the future that they want to do, they won't do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1208.3s	1208.3	 For example, look at all of the talk right now about how everybody needs to stand up, you know, more angel investing, more minority investing, more women, GPs, all of this stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1218.3s	1218.3	 Well, all of the folks, let's just be honest, all the folks that were in a position to put money into those folks are now 50 percent on a dollar rated basis, poorer if this thing passes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1230.3s	1230.3	 And I bet you what they're going to do is they're not going to cut their allocations in Sequoia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1234.3s	1234.3	 They're going to cut their allocations to all these other folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1236.3s	1236.3	 Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking, Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1239.3s	1239.3	 Who's it going to hurt? It's again, it's going to hurt all the people that you want to get into the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1243.3s	1243.3	 It's going to hurt all the people that are here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1245.3s	1245.3	 But the richest, richest, rich folks, that is not unless you act, unless you act appropriate the money from them, that's not you're not going to get a single cent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1252.3s	1252.3	 And then that was the that was the concept of the wealth tax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1255.3s	1255.3	 Wasn't it that you would take the total value that you have and just take away one percent a year from Bezos's, you know, or Zuckerberg's hundred billion dollars?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1264.3s	1264.3	 So would that not have been a better solution than this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1267.3s	1267.3	 If you had to pick one, a one percent wealth tax for people over whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1271.3s	1271.3	 Jason, then then we're no better than a banana republic that could also then expropriate a mine because we don't like the way that the mining is happening or, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1279.3s	1279.3	 another critical asset because the government decides that it's important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1282.3s	1282.3	 I mean, what's the difference between a stock and any other asset that either a person or a corporation owns?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1288.3s	1288.3	 It's it's it's very I think that the definitions are thin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1292.3s	1292.3	 They're all the same things at the end of the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1294.3s	1294.3	 Let's go back. Let's go back to the federal budget problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1296.3s	1296.3	 Like, how do you address it, Sachs? I mean, what's the right course here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1299.3s	1299.3	 What I think is amazing is we're we're about to spend we're raising this hundreds of billions of taxes in order to fund, you know, trillions of new spending.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1308.3s	1308.3	 I don't really hear the administration selling these new programs, selling the spending.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1314.3s	1314.3	 All we're really talking about is that there's too many rich people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1317.3s	1317.3	 We have these millionaires and billionaires. We got to tax them more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1320.3s	1320.3	 And so all we're really talking about is whether it's appropriate to be punishing the rich and super rich.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1326.3s	1326.3	 We're not really talking about where is this money going? Are these programs justified?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1330.3s	1330.3	 What do we get out of it? Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1332.3s	1332.3	 And my point is forget about like who it's going to hurt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1335.3s	1335.3	 I think it's eventually going to hurt the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1338.3s	1338.3	 And the question is, what do we get out of it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1340.3s	1340.3	 And I think what's amazing is this isn't even paying for the big ticket items on the progressive wish list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1345.3s	1345.3	 We're not getting to universal health care with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1350.3s	1350.3	 We're not getting to universal higher education.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1352.3s	1352.3	 We're not getting to any of the we're not getting to like forgiveness of student loans or anything like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1356.3s	1356.3	 We're not getting to any of the really big ticket items on the progressive wish list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1360.3s	1360.3	 And yet we're maxing out the taxes relative to anything we've done historically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1364.3s	1364.3	 And so where do you go from here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1367.3s	1367.3	 You know, because this is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the progressive agenda.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1372.3s	1372.3	 Doesn't that speak to the problem?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1374.3s	1374.3	 Like the fact that we have such an extraordinarily high debt burden and federal budget that we're kind of scrambling to figure out a way to kind of make ends meet effectively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1384.3s	1384.3	 Right. I mean, because our alternative again is to just let massive inflation run, you know, issue a ton of a ton of new debt or to cut spending.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1392.3s	1392.3	 No, no, no. But David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1394.3s	1394.3	 But either of those seem to be on the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1395.3s	1395.3	 No, no, no. You're going to exacerbate this issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1398.3s	1398.3	 I'm I'm telling you, I know it doesn't seem likely, but I think on a marginal basis, this will be an incentive to spend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1405.3s	1405.3	 And the reason is that it's a very frustrating idea for somebody to think about putting money in the ground, especially a sophisticated investor at a rate of return that just changed in half.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1416.3s	1416.3	 And so from my perspective, I would be more likely to spend because I would rather just YOLO the money than I would rather put it into the ground because I would be worried that that could then get taken away from me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1427.3s	1427.3	 It could also change even further and further.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1429.3s	1429.3	 And I think that's a very frustrating idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1431.3s	1431.3	 I'd rather take a vacation. Again, let's go back to the example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1434.3s	1434.3	 I'd rather take a vacation with that ten thousand dollars than go on to Jason's syndicate and put it into the hands of folks because I'm just like, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1441.3s	1441.3	 It's going to turn into even if even if Jason hits it and I get back, you know, I'd rather just go on vacation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1446.3s	1446.3	 Enough of those decisions. And I think I think you have a very different kind of economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1450.3s	1450.3	 You have you know what you have. You have what everybody else has.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1454.3s	1454.3	 So do we reduce spending?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1455.3s	1455.3	 I think you have to reduce expenses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1457.3s	1457.3	 I think that we have an infrastructure that is not well accounted for, meaning if you're a company, you can go to a company like Tableau.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1465.3s	1465.3	 You can go to a company like, you know, pick your pick your metrics company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1469.3s	1469.3	 And within, you know, a few weeks and months of work, you can literally understand where all the dollars are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1474.3s	1474.3	 Right. You can understand your business and you can figure out where money is being wasted and where it's not in a government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1480.3s	1480.3	 That's impossible to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1482.3s	1482.3	 Right. Because you have these laws and these laws are artificial constructs that we construct and those artificial constructs are influenced by money in and of itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1492.3s	1492.3	 And so these dollar flows are impossible to map. So you don't know where it goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1495.3s	1495.3	 So, for example, the seven hundred billion dollar budget in the Pentagon, does anybody have any idea what the ROI is on that or even a way to measure it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1503.3s	1503.3	 Like even to actually make it simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1505.3s	1505.3	 Well, like if you were if you had seven hundred billion dollars of investment capital, the market has a really simple way of saying, OK, David, what's your Royke?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1514.3s	1514.3	 What's your return on invested capital?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1516.3s	1516.3	 And you can say all kinds of fancy things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1519.3s	1519.3	 You can have all kinds of fancy projects or simple projects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1522.3s	1522.3	 But at the end of the day, what is measurable is a dollar in and what that dollar grew into.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1526.3s	1526.3	 And that's a return on invested capital. It is impossible to know that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1531.3s	1531.3	 And so, you know, we could say, for example, you could define it and say, well, I'm going to basically get every single person to graduate high school.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1539.3s	1539.3	 And now I'm going to spend five hundred billion dollars a year to make sure that the graduation rate is one hundred percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1545.3s	1545.3	 That would be an incredible goal. You know what? That is absolutely measurable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1548.3s	1548.3	 Right. And and you'd be able to back into all of these programs and the ones that ones that didn't work, you'd cut, you know, and you'd end up with what David said, which is school vouchers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1558.3s	1558.3	 I mean, just I think I think the absence of that accountability, Chamath, has led us to a scary dilemma.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1564.3s	1564.3	 And the dilemma is over 10 million Americans are directly employed by federal government and a large swath of the remainder of the economy is supported by federal government spending, which is basically your point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1577.3s	1577.3	 Right. So large amounts of defense and military construction, health care and pharma.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1582.3s	1582.3	 I mean, the list goes on, but like the direct employees of the federal government, plus the amount of revenue that depends on federal spending is so significant now as a percent of the total income generated by Americans that it is very hard to say, like, let's create accountability in a system when so much of the economy is functionally dependent on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1600.3s	1600.3	 Am I missing something, Sachs? Like, I mean, isn't that the circumstance we're in right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1604.3s	1604.3	 Yeah, I mean, the thing that like is amazing to me is, you know, I lived through the 1980s and 1990s like like you guys did from 1982 to 2000 that 18 year period, we had sort of an unrivaled economic performance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1619.3s	1619.3	 It was roughly around we had two bad years under George Herbert Walker Bush. That's why he lost reelection. But we had close to 40% growth in GDP.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1627.3s	1627.3	 Every year we had great productivity and we had massive deficit reduction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1633.3s	1633.3	 It's the last year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1634.3s	1634.3	 You said 4% a year in GDP.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1635.3s	1635.3	 Yeah. And we actually had government's surpluses, budget surpluses the last few years. So it seems to me that we had the winning formula as a country. And look, this is not partisan. I think it's bipartisan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1649.3s	1649.3	 I think the right solution is somewhere between what Reagan and Bill Clinton did. And, you know, Clinton, he rose, he increased the individual tax rate to 39.6. So he did do that from 36%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1663.3s	1663.3	 But he cut it from he cut the investment, the cap gains rate from 28 to 20. It was in that ballpark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1669.3s	1669.3	 You know, we know that works. You know, we know that works. I and and and you know, somehow we've moved away from what we learned in that time period because, you know, I think that the left in this country has has become kind of, you know, has embraced this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1685.3s	1685.3	 We're saying the same thing. You set up the incentives for people to invest. They do. If you set up the incentives for people to spend, they will do that as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1693.3s	1693.3	 I see this, I think, Shematha is exactly right. There are a lot of people and I use the example of the syndicate.com. When I do my syndicate deals, there are people who are recreationally saying, you know what, I love the idea of putting five or 10k into a flyer, they're gonna you know, half of them will go away a third of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1709.3s	1709.3	 All these people who are, you know, involved in day trading or crypto or real estate investing, they're gonna look at and say, Is this worth the time? Or is it worth this amount of time? Maybe I'll cut back from doing 40 hours a week of this to 20. And if you look at what happened crypto people, they went to Puerto Rico, you look what happened to venture capitalists and CEOs, they went to Florida, Miami, Austin, this is gonna, if it does pass, you could be pushing people to Singapore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1734.3s	1734.3	 Well, we have another very complicated problem. And this is what Freebird brought up, which is, and I don't know the answer, David. So I'm trying to I'm actually talking around your question, because I think it's a it's, it's the right absolute question. But think about this, what happens in a world where now let's just say that the revenue of the government goes up, right? But outcomes stay the same or get worse. And at the same time, and you could claim that that's effectively what's been happening over the last 20 or 30 years, right? Government revenues have gone up, impact has stayed the same or even worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1764.3s	1764.3	 They've probably been net negative. But then at the same time, you have this, you know, program of quantitative easing, where then you can essentially print money on demand. And when you think about that, it's like, wait a minute, I am giving you money. But then then you are also going to the photocopier machine with my money to make more money. And all of that total money does less than what it did when it was half that or a quarter or a third of it. That's a very scary realization, I think that people, you know, will eventually come to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1794.3s	1794.3	 And I don't know what the answer to that is. I, you know, I think David Saxey, who said it was just like, you know, the states are this incredible a b test, right? Because you get to test like theories, right? And you have you have now every complexion of theory, you have like, you know, the low tax states, the no tax states, the mid tax states, you have high real estate taxes, low real estate taxes, high estate tax, whatever, you get every grab bag of incentives. And you're going to see but the problem is that was assuming that the federal government kind of mostly stayed out of the way. Right? You have this massive overlay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1824.3s	1824.3	 Yeah, I just posted a chart in the chat that Nick can put up, which is federal spending federal outlays, a percentage of GDP. And it's really interesting because federal outlays, a percentage of GDP have generally been around the 20% line plus or minus a couple of percent since you know, the 1980s. And last year in 2019, it was 20.7%. It jumped to 31.3% under COVID. And it now feels like we're trying to make this new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1854.3s	1854.3	 level of you know, going from 20 to 30 permanent. It's like mask mask wearing. Well, the the problem is the only time we did that in history was in World War Two. Now we were trying to fight the Nazis, which was worth spending the money on. Yeah, I would say that was a good use of capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1869.5s	1869.5	 But it's very hard to step back, right? I mean, what starts out as temporary becomes permanent. Is that kind of the concern? Yeah, well, that's what that's what Milton Friedman said is there's nothing quite so permanent as a temporary government program. Right. But what they're threatening to make permanent is this new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1883.9s	1883.9	 permanently higher level of federal spending in the economy. And I think it's a very dangerous experiment because it either takes tremendous money printing to support it, or a tremendous tax burden. And neither one of them is good for the economy. By the way, you know, again, when Bill Clinton left office, I remember, you know, you can go to the time machine for White House.gov when he left in 2000. And he bragged about how under his terms under his eight years as president, they reduced federal spending from 22%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1913.9s	1913.9	 to 18% of the economy. Can you imagine a Democrat today boasting of that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1919.9s	1919.9	 Or even a Republican? I mean, what who was the guy who was your guy who was like the Tea Party people who there was somebody who was like in charge of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1928.9s	1928.9	 Senate? Oh, I don't know who was but it was just like, we got to cut spending.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1933.0s	1933.0	 Oh, yeah. Ryan, the speaker, the speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Yeah. All right. You're right. You're right. He is based on this. Yes. Spending restraints kind of gone out the window and in both parties and the republic. And it did it did happen under Trump, the Republicans don't seem to find their principles on spending unless and until there's a Democrat in the White House. So they definitely deserve their share of the blame on this. But but we do seem to be entering a new territory here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1958.9s	1958.9	 Of you know, this again, levels of spending we've never seen before. It's incredible. It's absolutely the problem. The problem is, it would be so much better if we just said we're going to do this one very specific thing with a huge number attached to it. Like I would rather say, we're going to Mars. Here's a trillion dollars. We're cutting student debt. Here's a trillion dollars. We're going to double down on cyber and we're going to get you know, completely pivot the military or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=1986.0s	1986.0	 Here's my green new deal, whatever something aspirational, that is not just anti rich people. Let's tax right now we have we have a labels, we have a label. And then we have a spaghetti mess of spending that just isn't really attached to what the label means. And none of it is accountable. And so you don't really get anything for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2004.4s	2004.4	 I know this is a silly question. But why wouldn't we test this and say, hey, 2040? There are numbers between these two, maybe we'll increase it 2% a year for eight years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2018.0s	2018.0	 I'm sorry, but see what happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2019.5s	2019.5	 This is the this is the other problem with like this idea of American exceptionalism. We believe that we can't learn anything from anybody else. And that's also not true. We actually know what it looks like when you have government as a massive portion of the economy. And we also know examples
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2033.9s	2033.9	 where government basically enables human capital outcomes, but remains relatively, you know, small and fixed Singapore, right? There's this there's this incredible, you know, there's this incredible example where I think, right when Lee Kuan Yew became the head of Singapore, the GDP of Singapore was the same as the GDP of Jamaica, right? And what you saw was this complete, just just complete divergence in these two countries. And think about this country, which is basically this like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2064.1s	2064.1	 you know, this little spot of land surrounded, you know, and, you know, apolitical, a religious surrounded by these Muslim countries, and they still thrived, and they kicked ass, you know, they were never invaded, etc, etc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2078.6s	2078.6	 And underneath that was this belief that it's what you said, Friedberg, where you focus on an outcome, you spend against the outcome, and you try to measure in a reasonable way, and you double down on the things that work. And then on the other hand, if you look at Europe, Europe is a good example when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2092.3s	2092.3	 you know, spending sometimes for the greater good in the best interest can run amok. And really, what happens is you start to stagnate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2099.8s	2099.8	 Yeah, and Singapore is only what six million people? I mean, it's like Ireland or Norway or Denmark. I mean, it's not a huge place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2106.8s	2106.8	 Sounds like we didn't solve any problems in that last piece.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2109.3s	2109.3	 We didn't solve. I mean, what do we think is going to happen in four years? Does Donald does this give Donald Trump a clear path into office if he said, hey, we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2117.1s	2117.1	 taxes again?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2118.1s	2118.1	 You know, the worst case scenario is you see what happened in France when they had that 75% super tax, and then they introduced the wealth tax and they had massive emigration of of invested dollars out of the country and people out of the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2130.1s	2130.1	 They did get rid of George, didn't they? That was a bonus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2134.5s	2134.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2136.1s	2136.1	 At what point? How many red pills do you guys have to take before you're willing to reassess your political party? Because it seems obvious to me now look, we can talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2145.5s	2145.5	 political party. Hold on, hold on. We can talk about we can talk about how bad the Republican Party is. But there's no question in my mind that the Democratic Party, all the energy, the base, the activists, and the politicians who have the microphone, they are woke socialists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2159.3s	2159.3	 Okay, that is the dominant ideology in the Democratic Party. And what Biden is doing right now is catering to that he's compromising wasn't catering to that until this point. He didn't put Bernie or Elizabeth Warren into any cabinet positions. He kind of marginalized them. And now he's like, okay, let's do something. I mean, would Warren and this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2178.9s	2178.9	 why I think no, but Jason, I think you're right. This is why I think this is like a sacrificial lamb. And I don't think anything's gonna happen. I don't I think Biden is a fundamental centrist. That's why I like him. I think he's a boring. He's a stable. He's a stable, predictable figure. And that's I think what you want in the in the presidency. I think that this is sort of like, okay, you guys want a pound of flesh? Here you go. But I think he's so politically smart, that he probably does have a bunch of millennial woke socialists whispering and chattering like, hey, do this, do that to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2208.9s	2208.9	 other. But he's probably the only one there who's smart enough to realize none of this won't get passed. You know, it's not going to muster enough support.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2215.1s	2215.1	 I don't know. I think I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2216.0s	2216.0	 Biden is not governing like a centrist right now. He's he's proposing, you know, what 4 trillion of new spending, you know, new tax increases, and he's just getting started. But look, and I would challenge this idea to slightly of him being a centrist. What I would say is, he's always tacked to the center of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2230.6s	2230.6	 Democratic Party. So I do I do think he's he's a triangular, triangulator, and a calibrator. He's not like a conviction politician, the way that a Bernie Sanders is or an Elizabeth Warren, but what he's tacked to is the center of the Democratic Party. And the center of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2247.3s	2247.3	 Democratic Party has moved very far left because all the activists have moved to the left. And so he's been dragged left. Remember, Biden was Clinton's floor manager in the Senate when he passed all this legislation. And so now Biden is very far to the left of where Biden was in the 1990s. And the reason for that is because the Democratic Party has moved. So once again, I guess, you know, my question to all of you guys is, what does it take? How far does the Democratic Party have to go to the left of Trump? Okay, I wouldn't I wouldn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2276.7s	2276.7	 call this the problem is Donald Trump. I wouldn't call this as much of a radical policy shift as I think it's being framed. I honestly think this is a natural and inevitable consequence of the circumstances we find ourselves in right now with respect to the spending level, the dependence we have on federal spending across the board with respect to individual employment and the economy, the need for a variety of social services to get us through this COVID economic collapse. I just don't see another way out. And I feel like it's the natural course to do exactly what's going on right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2306.7s	2306.7	 I think it's gonna pass. I think something like it's gonna pass. And I think something like it's gonna pass, but I don't think it's gonna pass. Yeah. Where do you put it out? You think it's gonna be equidistant? I'm not saying it's good or bad. I think obviously, we just find ourselves in this circumstance in this country in this moment in time, that this is the only path. I'm just not sure you can go in and go slash a ton of spending right now. And you know, and anyone would win reelection or any, you know, or most Americans would be anything but unhappy. It's just it's just the consequence of where we are. Let's play the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2336.7s	2336.7	 last half full. Here's a crazy idea. Okay. You know, for example, somebody like me, what I would think about, which I think is a little it's crazy, but I would do it is okay, I'm just going to move literally every single thing, every dollar that isn't nailed down into a charitable vehicle, and I will invest through my charity, because I still have to donate 5% a year, but then I can compound tax free. Now, I care more about the businesses that I'm a part of and the progress that I can create.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2366.7s	2366.7	 So that may be okay, and I'll just pay myself a salary to like fund my lifestyle. But that could be a way around this. To me, the biggest issue isn't how much money I have personally, the biggest issue is how much money I will have to put back into the world. And the idea that then it goes to a place where it's profligately spent in a way that isn't accountable really bothers me. That idea bothers me a lot. David, that would cause me to attack, you know, more even more to the right if I could find somebody who understood that principle, because what I don't want to have is, you know, in the absence of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2396.7s	2396.7	 social programs, like the problem that the Republicans leave is this no man's land where then you're forced to believe that this one man for yourself, it's all about you, you can figure it out, you know, the rugged individualism, that's just not realistic, like I, I am a complete byproduct of a social safety net, and that should exist. And the problem is that Republicans don't give you that option to have then accountability on spending, then just somebody please just say that I don't care what you call yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2426.7s	2426.7	 Yeah, well, look, I think, you know, that I think Republicans have gotten a lot more comfortable with the idea of entitlements and the social safety net, I don't really hear anyone opposing that anymore. I mean, it's the same things happened with like the Tories and in England, you know, no one's really trying to roll back the social safety net, we need a Republican messenger to come forward and say, listen, we don't care, you know, who you love, what you smoke, where you're from, what you look like, you know, we believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2456.7s	2456.7	 in an opportunity society, we want to spread that option to everybody. But ultimately, opportunity comes from the private sector, we're going to have a strong social safety net. And we're going to basically give everybody the most opportunity to participate by giving them a great education. That's basically what the agenda should be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2472.2s	2472.2	 Yeah, I'm in. I'm in. I mean, I to your point, starting line. Hallelujah. I like it. I mean, I would, I've got as your boy tried to dismantle Obamacare, you know, the problem is Trump, like Trump, I'm a never Trump or obviously, but I'm kind of perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2486.7s	2486.7	 I'm purple, I would, you know, I'm considering Austin or Miami as a place to locate myself and a decision like this makes it easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2493.6s	2493.6	 I would never do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2495.4s	2495.4	 I'm actually very I love Texas. I love Austin. Austin is the kind of purple I like. Like I like personal freedom. And I like what you're saying, like love who you love smoke what you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2506.0s	2506.0	 What year did you move to the Bay Area?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2508.2s	2508.2	 Five, six years ago. I was in LA for 10 New York for 30.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2512.2s	2512.2	 I feel like it's a last in first out thing that's going on right now with respect to immigration out of California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2517.3s	2517.3	 I've been here since 2000. I'm not leaving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2519.6s	2519.6	 Yeah, I've been here my since I was six years old in California, and I'm not leaving. And I've been in the Bay Area since college. So I'm not, you know, I feel like it's a lot harder to leave when you've been here longer. It's a lot easier to leave when you've been here less time. That certainly seems to be the pattern I've seen amongst friends and colleagues with respect to leaving the state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2536.8s	2536.8	 All right. The Chauvin trial came back guilty all three charges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2543.2s	2543.2	 What is there to even talk about here? What is there to talk about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2545.5s	2545.5	 I don't even know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2546.4s	2546.4	 I mean, I feel like we should.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2547.2s	2547.2	 Why were you like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2548.5s	2548.5	 Can I give a shout out to a really good friend of mine. His name is Neil Katyal. He was the former Solicitor General under Obama.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2557.3s	2557.3	 He was one of the prosecutors that worked on that case. He's a partner at Hogan's, runs a Supreme Court practice here, but basically went and did this pro bono trial on behalf of the state of Minnesota, working with the district attorney. And I just want to say, Neil, proud of you. It's an incredible thing. Thank you for keeping America safe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2583.6s	2583.6	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2585.0s	2585.0	 I mean, you know, it's crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2588.1s	2588.1	 But then, you know, the same day there was there was a shooting of this, this unfortunate shooting of this, I think, I think she was 16 years old, 16 years old, this black girl in Ohio. And then, you know, LeBron tweeted something out and then LeBron had to basically delete the tweet because it was causing people to go absolutely crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2601.9s	2601.9	 Well, I mean, each of these situations is unique. And in that situation, somebody was going to stab another person, the cop didn't know what was going to happen. And, you know, in another time period, like maybe that would have been saving somebody's life who had potentially been stabbed. And, you know, the George Floyd, I think he had a reserve judgment on each of these until you get all the information. But the information here was just super conclusive, like the gymnastics Ben Shapiro, and some of these far right, right, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2632.0s	2632.0	 People had to go through to say what you saw in George Floyd being murdered was not what happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2638.2s	2638.2	 Well, that's that's performative theater, trying to get people to watch something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2641.6s	2641.6	 And it was I mean, it was just gross to watch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2643.7s	2643.7	 I might as well call it what it is like that's acting. I feel like probably if anybody if any one of us found Ben Shapiro in a bar and just hung out and had a beer, you'd find out that he was like he was like the Meryl Streep of our generation. You know, like this incredible actor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2656.8s	2656.8	 What does that mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2658.2s	2658.2	 Like an incredible actor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2659.6s	2659.6	 Well, no, I mean, I think Adam's and his podcast, all these guys are just trying to figure out how to say that this was a travesty of justice. And I'm like, I don't know what you saw. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2670.0s	2670.0	 yeah, let me explain where they went wrong. Okay, so. So look, I agree with you guys, fundamentally, this was an easy look, this was, you know, finding a fact by the jury guilty on all charges. Obvious, right? The tape shows it. His the Chauvin's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2687.7s	2687.7	 record as a cop, numerous complaints, you know, this was a bad apple. This was a bad cop. He deserved to be convicted. End of story. That's where the analysis should end. But of course, the people on cable news would have nothing to say if that was the end of it. And so look, I think both the right and the left kind of went off the rails on this where, you know, the right kind of went off the rails is you had well, what happened is you had Maxine Waters, you know, come out. And while the jury was still deliberating, she was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2717.1s	2717.1	 basically calling for activists to get more confrontational on the streets if the verdict went the wrong way. And so then the defense helpful, not helpful, right. And so that so then the defense made a motion saying that this this was affecting the deliberations, there's no proof of that the jewel, the judge ruled against that motion, but he did. The judge reiterated his desire for the politicians to stop talking about the case, right. And so then what happened is the the right wing commentators were criticized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2747.1s	2747.1	 for analyzing Maxine Waters and implying that that there was an effort to try and coerce the jury. And there's no proof of that, right. And and and I think there's the mistake is in somehow framing the Derek Chauvin as like a sacrificial lamb to the mob. He was not he was guilty. He deserved it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2766.1s	2766.1	 That being said, I do think that the judge had a point that it would be helpful if these politicians would just stay out of it, stop commenting on it while the jury is deliberating. I think there was a legit point there. But you know, the left made some some weird comments as well. You had Nancy Pelosi made this really bizarre
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2786.1s	2786.1	 statement. I think that was like a slip up of like, just trying to say something not I mean, being charitable, she was trying to say something nice, that George Floyd is going to create a wave of justice. And that's a great idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2800.1s	2800.1	 She said, yeah, she said, Thank you, George Floyd for sacrificing your life for justice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2804.1s	2804.1	 justice. Yeah, that didn't come out exactly as she intended. No, no, I mean, because look, George Floyd did not go out that day intending to be a martyr. No, no, no. And, and so it, it sort of gave it expressed kind of what she's thinking, which is how am I going to use this politically? You know, train
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2825.1s	2825.1	 it came out pretty gross, right? It came out gross, for sure. I think that's how they're trained. It's kind of like, you know, if you if you take a finely tuned athlete in a sport, and give them, you know, they're just they're reactive, because they're so instinctual. I think it's kind of like this, she's an incredibly finely trained athlete in her domain is politics. And so, you know, what is that phrase? Every crisis is an opportunity kind of thing. So I think I mean, they all flew there to be there for the for the trial, etc. And that couldn't have helped them. And I think that's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2855.1s	2855.1	 judge with, you know, the impartial jury, and maybe that causes a mistrial. I mean, I don't know, David, you're an attorney. Is there any chance on appeal that a maxi water quote like that could result in?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2868.5s	2868.5	 Well, the judge actually said that the defense could reserve that issue and use it on appeal. So yeah, they could use it. But I don't think it's good. I don't think it's gonna work unless they can prove that somehow the jury was contaminated by what they were hearing on TV.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2884.6s	2884.6	 The judges instructions were pretty clear, like I watched a couple of the ending days. And he's very clear, like he's like, guys, I don't want you to watch the news, you know, the stuff like that he was very directive in making sure that they tried to be as uncontaminated as possible. So I think the surface area for an appeal is pretty thin here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2899.2s	2899.2	 The fact that the police chief and everybody who worked with him said, like, this is not standard this and they just threw him right under the bus, they didn't want to be associated with this in any way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2909.1s	2909.1	 By the way, well, you know, they're not going to be able to hide much longer, though, because the DOJ said they're opening an investigation into Minnesota police force. So I think they're just trying to crack open the police reform in that state and just get those guys on the right side. And it's going to be, you know, again, here's this other issue where it's like, okay, this is where like, there, it's very difficult for the federal government to do anything. But you know, so whatever they try to do won't really result in what what you want to have, because every state, again, Jason, to your point, has completely different political ideologies, nobody wants to behave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2939.1s	2939.1	 the same, everybody wants to be independent, everybody wants to get reelected as not kowtowing to somebody else. And so you just don't get these consistent outcomes. And then people are forced to vote with their feet and move across the country. You know, to get a bunch of simple things that I think should be pretty consistent across the entire country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2956.5s	2956.5	 The thing that I found particularly deranged was these people who are like, listen, he's a fentanyl addict, he's an opioid addict, which by the way, there are tons of affluent people, everybody in this country is addicted to opioids, fentanyls are everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2969.1s	2969.1	 Fentanyl is everywhere. And then you're trying to say like, because he had that addiction, but in some way that negates the person kneeling on his back while he's in handcuffs, like you're you have a duty as a police officer to take care of somebody when he's in handcuffs, how is he any threat in any way and then to listen to Scott Adams and Ben Shapiro on these absolute pieces of garbage try to say, Oh, you know, there was the fentanyl that killed him. It's like, yeah, no, the person on his back kneeling on him for nine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=2999.1s	2999.1	 minutes because it's about it's about ratings. Now, switching topics and to talk about ratings something a little later. The most interesting popcorn thing that I watched was the Hulu documentary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3011.4s	3011.4	 You did watch the Hulu documentary on WeWork?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3013.7s	3013.7	 WeWork. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3014.4s	3014.4	 I gotta watch it. I gotta watch it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3016.1s	3016.1	 I haven't seen it yet. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3017.4s	3017.4	 It is it is in a word. I think I think the good I think the right word is like, outrageous. I think the guy who stole it, Jason was the lawyer who they interviewed. Yep. He had some incredible kind of like one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3028.7s	3028.7	 of the miners. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3030.9s	3030.9	 But I think it's yeah, the I had a G I'll be honest, and this may sound crazy, but I actually had a fair amount of sympathy for Adam Newman and watching it. I think that he at least in the documentary, it came out that he you know, not not that he didn't create this issue, but that I think it was a little overly scapegoated because it's very hard for you to incinerate $45 billion without the complicity at a minimum of your board of directors. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3058.6s	3058.6	 And and a bunch of like extremely well healed, thoughtful investors. And so there was just there was just this so much complicity in this thing. So if anything, my takeaway was that he he shares, he shares the blame with a lot of other people. And it's not it wasn't, you know, him and him only. But my gosh, that documentary, some of the things guys are just they're fabulous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3078.8s	3078.8	 This is this is always true in these businesses that end up with, you know, bad actors that are enabled. Right. I mean, it's been the case in public and public success stories and failures. Right. I mean, there's a cult of personality. The personality provides the high beta personality provides the alpha. And it can also provide like a Theranos outcome. And, you know, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3103.6s	3103.6	 thing that when you'll see when you watch this is I don't know if you guys watch the vow about that NXIVM cult, which is just equally loathsome, horrible people behaving badly. But he really targeted young people to work there and indoctrinated him into this we're changing the world. And then there were no adults there. And you see him behind the scenes when he's talking at the IPO roadshow, and he's having basically a panic attack. And he's psychotic. I mean, he was really deranged. And they have this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3133.6s	3133.6	 video of him trying to get through the IPO roadshow. What show is it? What movie is this? It's the WeWork documentary. We work documentary. Just get Hulu. Yeah, it is so deranged. It's awesome. I mean, it's fire festival level deranged is a big word. I don't I'm not sure that it's deranged. But I think it's like it's juicy. It's it's gossipy. And like that whole thing, like we school they're like, we have to democratize education for 60,000 a year. Have you guys ever?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3163.6s	3163.6	 Have you guys ever regretted enabling, you know, quirky personality entrepreneurs that you've backed and then you've regretted it later?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3170.9s	3170.9	 Yeah, so the problem is, it's hard, it's hard to know in the midst of it, you know, I guess is like kind of like that line, like the line between genius and insanity is very thin. But yeah, I mean, the one thing I will say is I've only ever had one issue of outright fraud. And so you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3188.8s	3188.8	 tell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3190.0s	3190.0	 well, no, I mean, in hundreds of in hundreds of companies that I've that I've invested in, luckily, I've only I've only seen one issue where, you know, the CEO was extremely, I don't know, aggressive in how they accounted for and book revenue. And, you know, this is where one thing that we don't have at the early stage companies, we don't have the check and balance of a reporting infrastructure and a third party watchdog and all these other people. And so, you know, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3218.5s	3218.5	 guys all know this, when we go in and we sit in a meeting, in a board meeting, and you know, the entrepreneur puts slides up, there is an inherent 100% categorical belief that they're that they aren't lying, right? Like, you don't you don't even have to check that assumption. It's just assumed that nobody's lying, you know, good or bad, we're just presenting the data. And I had one case where the guy lied. And it wasn't one was was and our CFO and you know, our team figured it out. And, you know, there were other investors and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3248.5s	3248.5	 it was, we all were just really shocked. And we had to kind of clean it up as best we could. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3253.9s	3253.9	 I have literally a dozen. And they we didn't wind up investing in I think 10 of the 12. And the reason is, we took diligence to your point, your mouth like do you how do you even know in a board meeting, I just said, screw it, I'm going to build a diligence team. And we asked people for all their bank statements, and for their iTunes account and for their Google Analytics. And if a company doesn't give those to us, we just know that something's up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3278.7s	3278.7	 And we figure it out before we invest, because the two times we did get dinged on this, we had one where somebody was giving themselves a loan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3285.8s	3285.8	 So you do diligence?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3287.3s	3287.3	 We did. We've just been having a diligence list that says give us the incorporation docs and all these bank statements. Now somebody could fraudulently change a bank statement that is possible. So there, it depends on how people want to go in the fraud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3300.6s	3300.6	 But did you guys ever like enable a personality that was just like so over the top, and then you're like, oh, shit, this is actually gonna, this is actually an explosion. Like it's a total disaster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3309.8s	3309.8	 My top three investments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3314.0s	3314.0	 That's a good point there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3315.0s	3315.0	 That's a good point, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3315.7s	3315.7	 Yeah. So because, okay, so I wrote about this in my blog post blitz fail about the sort of how, how founder psychology can actually cause a company to go off the rails.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3324.8s	3324.8	 Zinni Fitz.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3326.4s	3326.4	 The thing is that founders do need to be much more aggressive than the average person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3332.8s	3332.8	 You know, we like to think that a quality, that a personality trait like aggressiveness, there's like some sort of normal distribution of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3339.4s	3339.4	 And you kind of want to be, you know, somewhere in the middle of the curve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3342.4s	3342.4	 And it's actually not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3344.3s	3344.3	 You want founders to be much more aggressive than the average person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3348.1s	3348.1	 Because if they're not, they're just not going to persevere and push hard enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3352.2s	3352.2	 Right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3352.5s	3352.5	 And Jay, I mean, we saw this with Uber, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3355.1s	3355.1	 I mean, TK was a super aggressive personality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3357.4s	3357.4	 The company would not have been as successful had he not pushed that hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3361.0s	3361.0	 And so the curve in the real world, it's not a normal distribution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3364.9s	3364.9	 It looks more like a curve where there are returns to aggressiveness and they're keeping increasing returns to it until suddenly the person goes too far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3373.1s	3373.1	 And then they jumped the shark and the whole thing craters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3375.2s	3375.2	 But wait, can I say something?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3377.2s	3377.2	 Like, you know, having been in the engine room with Zuck in a critical moment, Zuck was an aggressive guy, but he wasn't over the top.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3384.2s	3384.2	 And he wasn't just this like crazy weirdo personality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3387.8s	3387.8	 He wasn't enabling sexual harassment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3390.0s	3390.0	 He was doing any of that stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3391.4s	3391.4	 Would you say?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3392.6s	3392.6	 Yeah, he was he was he was he was an intellectually incisive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3396.4s	3396.4	 He was an aggressive thinker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3397.9s	3397.9	 So this is why my reaction to David's question is, I haven't backed assholes because I just think that that archetype doesn't work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3404.7s	3404.7	 Zuck's a very cool analytical personality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3407.0s	3407.0	 There are these founders that, you know, we I've heard the term wild stallion to to describe them where they are, you know, they're like these these wild stallions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3417.4s	3417.4	 They have tremendous upside, but they're also a little bit, you know, wild.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3421.6s	3421.6	 And unless they sort of learn to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3423.0s	3423.0	 Get hit with the hoof.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3423.9s	3423.9	 Yeah, I mean, they're they're they're they've got a lot of talent, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3430.0s	3430.0	 The the the talent is the amount of talent you have is like the horse you're riding on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3434.3s	3434.3	 And some people are riding on a Bronco.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3436.6s	3436.6	 They got a lot of talent, but it might just say I just think the real the real edge in investing is figuring out what is bluster and window dressing and show and what is actually aggressive thinking like John and Patrick Collison.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3449.3s	3449.3	 There's zero bluster with those guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3451.3s	3451.3	 Yeah, those guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3451.9s	3451.9	 You Shopify zero that company is zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3455.1s	3455.1	 That's going to be the most valuable valuable company that's private right now besides these guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3459.4s	3459.4	 Are these guys are incredible, intellectually thoughtful killers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3462.7s	3462.7	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3463.0s	3463.0	 That's what they are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3463.5s	3463.5	 That's true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3464.1s	3464.1	 They out think everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3465.7s	3465.7	 But there's also a maturation process that a lot of founders go through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3468.6s	3468.6	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3468.9s	3468.9	 I mean, the Colson's and Zuck, I think, got very mature, very young.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3473.4s	3473.4	 I think there's other founders that it takes them a while to get more polished, get more disciplined, rein in that, you know, those emotions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3483.4s	3483.4	 I'm not saying they're fraudulent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3484.7s	3484.7	 We don't want to bet on fraudulent founders, but some founders need to learn how to harness the talent they have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3491.0s	3491.0	 Yeah, I agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3492.2s	3492.2	 I agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3493.3s	3493.3	 And those are the ones where it's very hard to know earlier in their career whether to bet on them or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3498.4s	3498.4	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3498.9s	3498.9	 I agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3499.5s	3499.5	 Because they may get it under control or they may not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3502.0s	3502.0	 It's you can't tell at the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3503.4s	3503.4	 Here's the analogy we use internally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3505.1s	3505.1	 It's like being Professor X and the X-Men.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3507.8s	3507.8	 You could have a Jean Grey or a Wolverine and like everybody's got a different superpower, but you need to teach them how to use that superpower so they don't self-destruct or cause chaos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3516.8s	3516.8	 They can bifurcate the other way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3517.9s	3517.9	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3518.4s	3518.4	 They could be Magneto.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3519.7s	3519.7	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3520.0s	3520.0	 You could go the other way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3522.0s	3522.0	 Not sure I get all the references, but I hear you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3524.6s	3524.6	 Well, I mean, I'm kind of shocked given how much of a huge nerd you are that you don't understand the X-Men.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3530.2s	3530.2	 Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3530.8s	3530.8	 I love that movie with the guy who's made of all the rocks and the little tree guy who's his buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3535.9s	3535.9	 That's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3536.4s	3536.4	 That's Guardians of the Galaxy, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3538.3s	3538.3	 I think Jason's favorite character is the Blob.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3542.2s	3542.2	 That's coming to you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3543.3s	3543.3	 You dropped COVID-20, I dropped COVID-15.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3547.2s	3547.2	 What are you talking about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3548.1s	3548.1	 How many of those Cubano sandwiches are you having?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3552.0s	3552.0	 Look at your face, dude.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3554.9s	3554.9	 No croquetas, Sax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3557.0s	3557.0	 Are you right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3557.6s	3557.6	 I shouldn't have gotten there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3559.0s	3559.0	 Side salad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3559.7s	3559.7	 Bad idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3560.3s	3560.3	 I shouldn't have gotten there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3561.0s	3561.0	 You're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3561.3s	3561.3	 Yeah.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3565.2s	3565.2	 Well, Sax, what is your health plan?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3566.6s	3566.6	 Are you...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3567.2s	3567.2	 Now that we're coming out of COVID, are you running or like...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3569.0s	3569.0	 Yes, we've got an intervention right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3570.6s	3570.6	 You look terrible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3573.1s	3573.1	 You do look a little bloated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3574.6s	3574.6	 You look like a puffed fish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3577.1s	3577.1	 Oh, jeez.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3578.0s	3578.0	 I need to lose like 20 pounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3580.1s	3580.1	 Puffed fish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3581.0s	3581.0	 I'm down 12 from my peak of the COVID peak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3583.2s	3583.2	 I'm feeling good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3584.7s	3584.7	 Just get a personal trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3586.1s	3586.1	 Speaking of COVID, what the hell is going on in India?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3588.8s	3588.8	 Oh, my Lord.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3589.7s	3589.7	 It's scary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3590.3s	3590.3	 I thought the whole thing was they were taking hydroxychloroquine for totally different reasons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3594.3s	3594.3	 And this is why it's all fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3595.4s	3595.4	 Or that they had some immunity or that it was hot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3597.8s	3597.8	 I mean, there was a million reasons of why they were not going to get hit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3600.4s	3600.4	 And then now they're surging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3602.1s	3602.1	 And we have 60 million shots on the shelf.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3605.5s	3605.5	 And the number of people getting shots is going down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3607.6s	3607.6	 This is America's chance to use instead of battleships and nuclear weapons, we can use this COVID to shape global policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3617.0s	3617.0	 We should be getting vaccines to other countries and be once again, the shining light of the entire planet and humanity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3626.1s	3626.1	 Why are we not bringing shots to India now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3629.8s	3629.8	 We have so many extra.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3630.9s	3630.9	 I'm not sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3631.5s	3631.5	 I'm just trying to pull up the India Vax data per day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3634.0s	3634.0	 I'm not sure that there's a that's as much the issue, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3640.2s	3640.2	 I mean, it is scary to watch there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3642.4s	3642.4	 I mean, you're our go to science guy, Freiburg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3645.1s	3645.1	 Tell us what we're looking at here on this chart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3647.0s	3647.0	 I mean, the daily COVID cases are now hitting 250,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3651.9s	3651.9	 300,000 a day, Jason, right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3653.6s	3653.6	 It broke 300.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3654.6s	3654.6	 Oh, my Lord.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3655.2s	3655.2	 And the United States has gotten down to like 50, 60.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3657.6s	3657.6	 India is now past the peak of the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3662.4s	3662.4	 India is now seeing more cases per day than any country has seen worldwide during the whole pandemic at over 300,000 a day right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3671.9s	3671.9	 And it doesn't seem to be letting up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3674.4s	3674.4	 And we're now questioning whether it's testing that's the limiting factor in terms of reporting on these cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3679.2s	3679.2	 So it's pretty nasty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3680.9s	3680.9	 Now, there's a famous Indian politician who who had been double vaxxed, who claims that he is COVID positive as is his mother and sister.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3692.2s	3692.2	 And so it's also creating a little bit of a concern in the market about, you know, getting COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3698.8s	3698.8	 Now, he doesn't seem to be having a severe case, which is one of the kind of important things to take note of in vaccination is it's not necessarily binary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3710.4s	3710.4	 But it's certainly making a lot of creating a lot of fear as a result of his kind of public statement about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3716.8s	3716.8	 This isn't just about cases either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3719.7s	3719.7	 30 days ago, they were at 200 deaths a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3723.6s	3723.6	 And, I mean, tragically, they're at 2100.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3727.4s	3727.4	 So it's 10x in 30 days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3729.2s	3729.2	 If it 10x is again, that's 20,000 people a day dying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3733.6s	3733.6	 This is a different level than any other country has experienced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3737.3s	3737.3	 And they don't look at the end of the day, the hospitals, hospitals to handle this, do they?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3742.2s	3742.2	 This could become a crisis of epic proportions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3745.1s	3745.1	 At the end of the day, a country's success in battling COVID is going to be about how fast they can get their population vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3750.4s	3750.4	 It's very simple, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3751.8s	3751.8	 I mean, Israel was first, they got everyone vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3754.6s	3754.6	 Now their cases are down to almost nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3757.8s	3757.8	 The US is doing pretty well, although there's some room for concern.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3761.3s	3761.3	 We were doing, you know, close to four million vaccinations a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3764.6s	3764.6	 Now we're at like three, three and a half.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3766.7s	3766.7	 They're starting to slip a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3769.6s	3769.6	 And that doesn't have to do with Johnson and Johnson, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3771.8s	3771.8	 That has to do with people not showing up for appointments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3775.1s	3775.1	 Yeah. And I think you got to blame the media a little bit because they keep running all these vaccine scare stories about, you know, how this person or that person, the vaccine punched through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3784.2s	3784.2	 They got sick despite getting the vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3786.3s	3786.3	 They keep selling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3787.4s	3787.4	 They keep selling all this like, you know, COVID scurrient porn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3792.1s	3792.1	 You know, the fear porn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3793.4s	3793.4	 Do you know what I noticed the other day on CNN?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3795.3s	3795.3	 This is how insincere and ratings desperate they are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3799.9s	3799.9	 When they put up their COVID stats, they put up cumulative cases and cumulative deaths.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3804.3s	3804.3	 That's what they obsess on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3805.8s	3805.8	 And it's like, hey, dummies, we know what you're doing here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3808.6s	3808.6	 You're trying to scare people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3810.4s	3810.4	 You should show the graph of the deaths going down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3813.6s	3813.6	 And then why can't you take your mask off if you're vaccinated and you're outside?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3817.8s	3817.8	 Let's give a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3819.0s	3819.0	 You were talking about this last week, didn't you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3820.4s	3820.4	
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3820.4s	3820.4	 Nate Silver had a really good tweet about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3822.3s	3822.3	 He said that wearing a mask after you're vaccinated is now it's like the blue equivalent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3827.0s	3827.0	 of the red MAGA hat, where it's completely performative to say, hey, I'm on team blue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3832.5s	3832.5	 You know, even though like scientifically it's meaningless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3835.0s	3835.0	 I it's like the press, they keep talking about this possibility that even after you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3840.7s	3840.7	 vaccinated and you could somehow, you know, keep transmitting the virus to other people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3845.8s	3845.8	 Look, viruses, I mean, and Freeberg can explain this better than me, but viruses do not have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3850.8s	3850.8	 in themselves the machinery for replication, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3853.5s	3853.5	 They have to take over your cells, hijack your cells, machinery to replicate themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3858.4s	3858.4	 So first they have to infect somebody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3860.6s	3860.6	 Then that person gets, you know, gets the virus, starts producing a lot of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3864.4s	3864.4	 Then they start shedding it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3865.7s	3865.7	 If you don't get really sick, you're not going to be shedding a lot of the virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3869.0s	3869.0	 You're not going to be transmitting it to a lot of other people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3871.6s	3871.6	 And, you know, they talk about this, this possibility as if it's like a real possibility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3876.9s	3876.9	 that people could still be transmitting the virus after they're vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3881.1s	3881.1	 I mean, it's not a statistically relevant possibility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3883.6s	3883.6	 Right. It comes down to this interpretation of everything being binary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3887.0s	3887.0	 And the reality is that all of this is on, you know, a statistical curve or on a kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3893.3s	3893.3	 of a gray scale. And, you know, the sexist point is a hundred percent correct that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3898.4s	3898.4	 probability of someone who's been double vaccinated getting infectious, getting infected
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3903.0s	3903.0	 and then being infectious in a meaningful way is so remote that it is not even worth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3909.0s	3909.0	 kind of considering in a way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3911.5s	3911.5	 And being double vaccinated gives you such a significant typically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3916.0s	3916.0	 Right. Not for everyone. Right. All immune systems are different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3918.8s	3918.8	 And some of what we might be seeing is the difference in kind of how people develop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3923.2s	3923.2	 immunity. But it is such a rare case that one could have a severe infection after getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3929.9s	3929.9	 a vaccination is such that it shouldn't even be considered and kind of mentioned as being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3935.7s	3935.7	 a reason for continuing to wear masks and not gather and not do things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3939.1s	3939.1	 And so, you know, we started out, as Sachs pointed out, and I think this is such a true and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3942.3s	3942.3	 important point. We started out with this like immediate politicization of what's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3948.0s	3948.0	 right thing to do to reduce the spread of the virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3950.6s	3950.6	 And then that became the mainstay for that political affiliation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3954.2s	3954.2	 And now the transition of the new world that we live in, where most people are vaccinated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3959.4s	3959.4	 we have a better understanding of the science and the statistics and the mechanisms of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3962.8s	3962.8	 transmission. We hold on and we grasp on to that initiating kind of belief system that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3969.6s	3969.6	 was correct at the time, but isn't correct anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3973.5s	3973.5	 And it seems so difficult to get people to shift their mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3976.3s	3976.3	 This kind of this behavior is an ignorant behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3979.6s	3979.6	 And you see it in so many manifestations right now, in particular with respect to masks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3985.4s	3985.4	 and behavior after vaccination and so on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3988.0s	3988.0	 And it's it's really brutal to watch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3990.3s	3990.3	 But we obviously digress a bit from the Indian circumstance, which is a really nasty one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3996.2s	3996.2	 So it looks like...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3996.8s	3996.8	 But why now and not a year ago?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=3998.9s	3998.9	 You know, it's it's not clear, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4000.4s	4000.4	 So there's someone provided an indication today that there may be as many as somewhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4007.2s	4007.2	 between 100 and 200 unique variants that we're seeing emerge in India.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4010.8s	4010.8	 So there may be a lot of interesting, very interesting technically, but not obviously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4016.3s	4016.3	 for human life, but a lot of dramatic variants or significant variants that might be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4022.2s	4022.2	 increasing the the infectiousness right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4025.5s	4025.5	 And and in particular, you know, behavior has shifted in a way that's enabling some of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4030.9s	4030.9	 these transmissions to occur.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4032.2s	4032.2	 You know, a lot of people let their guard down and so on in a way that maybe they weren't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4035.0s	4035.0	 six months ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4036.7s	4036.7	 And, you know, there may be some forced evolution associated with partial vaccination.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4043.0s	4043.0	 Totally a theory right now, where 110 million doses have been given in India so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4048.8s	4048.8	 So, you know, in order for a virus to succeed, the viral variants that are going to infect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4053.7s	4053.7	 more likely through a partially transmitted, a partially vaccinated population are the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4058.8s	4058.8	 ones that are winning out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4060.2s	4060.2	 So there's a lot of confounding factors here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4062.6s	4062.6	 We're not really sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4064.4s	4064.4	 But it is it is pretty brutal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4067.1s	4067.1	 What is what is going on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4069.6s	4069.6	 I will say, like this notion that vaccination does not prevent protection against variants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4075.5s	4075.5	 is not a binary statement either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4077.2s	4077.2	 This is really, really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4078.4s	4078.4	 I've been wanting to say this for a couple of our shows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4081.7s	4081.7	 When you get this vaccine, what you're doing is you're training yourselves, you're giving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4086.2s	4086.2	 yourselves the RNA to print the spike protein and that protein is now in your body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4090.7s	4090.7	 Everyone's immune system then reacts differently to create antibodies to that protein.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4096.0s	4096.0	 The antibodies that Chamath makes and Jason makes and Saks makes and I make are all going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4099.9s	4099.9	 to be different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4100.9s	4100.9	 But if you had to pick whose would be better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4104.2s	4104.2	 I can tell you Saks is probably going to be the worst off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4106.1s	4106.1	 But Jason's are the most sluggish for sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4108.2s	4108.2	 They're the slowest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4109.3s	4109.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4109.8s	4109.8	 But there are likely tens of thousands of novel variants that our B cells will make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4115.5s	4115.5	 that will bind to that spike protein and get rid of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4118.5s	4118.5	 And we will each have many hundreds or potentially thousands of novel antibodies that our immune
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4123.1s	4123.1	 system will make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4123.7s	4123.7	 So keep that in mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4124.7s	4124.7	 You now have a portfolio of antibodies that your body is producing to that spike protein.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4129.8s	4129.8	 So now when a SARS-CoV-2 virus shows up in your body, some of those antibodies are going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4136.3s	4136.3	 to be really effective at getting rid of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4138.2s	4138.2	 Some of them are not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4139.5s	4139.5	 Now, the protein in the SARS-CoV-2 virus changes slightly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4143.3s	4143.3	 Some of the other antibodies you have are going to be effective and some of the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4146.6s	4146.6	 ones are not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4147.7s	4147.7	 And it is that portfolio that is going to change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4151.2s	4151.2	 Sorry, that portfolio that is going to define your success at fighting off a specific
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4156.3s	4156.3	 variant of SARS-CoV-2 where the spike protein is changing slightly with each variant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4161.2s	4161.2	 Right. So these variants change the composition of the protein.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4163.9s	4163.9	 The antibodies that you have are going to be more or less successful depending on how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4167.5s	4167.5	 that variant changes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4168.8s	4168.8	 And that's where there may be cases where the number of antibodies that you are producing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4174.0s	4174.0	 or the success of the antibodies that you particularly have are a little bit lower for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4178.2s	4178.2	 a particularly new variant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4179.4s	4179.4	 It doesn't mean that you're going to have an infection that's going to be a runaway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4182.7s	4182.7	 infection in your body. It means that it might take you longer or it might be a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4186.4s	4186.4	 bit harder for you to clear that particular variant given the repertoire of antibodies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4190.5s	4190.5	 that you've produced. And that's why this isn't binary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4194.0s	4194.0	 Right. It could be that it's like, hey, this variant shows up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4196.7s	4196.7	 Boom. Instantly, I got rid of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4198.2s	4198.2	 I don't have any infection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4199.3s	4199.3	 But someone else might have like, you know, maybe a slight bit of, you know, there might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4204.0s	4204.0	 be a couple of days where they'll feel a cold as your body's clearing it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4207.0s	4207.0	 And the measure of this is this neutralizing titer, which is where they take people's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4212.1s	4212.1	 blood with all of their antibodies in it and they put these different variants in and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4215.6s	4215.6	 they can measure how effective your antibodies are getting rid of that new variant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4220.2s	4220.2	 And the less effective your antibodies are, the higher this titer needs to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4225.6s	4225.6	 And as a result, it could be a little bit longer, a little bit harder for you to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4228.8s	4228.8	 rid of that virus. And so, so again, like when viral variants start to emerge in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4232.9s	4232.9	 population and as they kind of take off and become more dominant, it doesn't mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4238.2s	4238.2	 that we don't have immunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4239.7s	4239.7	 It means that immunity might be slightly affected, but not not it's not one or zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4244.4s	4244.4	 Right. Because you've got hundreds or thousands of antibodies to fight against COVID
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4248.6s	4248.6	 in your body. And I think that's really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4250.5s	4250.5	 So we should, you know, while there may be some variants that might be what we call
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4253.4s	4253.4	 variants of concern, meaning they can kind of slip away a little bit from most of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4256.9s	4256.9	 antibodies you have. It doesn't mean you're not going to be able to fight them off with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4259.9s	4259.9	 the antibodies. And so I don't know if that was too technical or too difficult to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4263.7s	4263.7	 understand, but I think it's really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4264.9s	4264.9	 It makes total sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4266.2s	4266.2	 Yeah. And one thing just to add to that is, is that most of the variants that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4271.9s	4271.9	 press keeps reporting with alarm that are somehow that basically are going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4277.1s	4277.1	 vaccine proof, they turn out not to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4279.5s	4279.5	 You know, very shortly there comes out a new article basically saying that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4286.1s	4286.1	 vaccines work. And so the press keeps reporting these isolated cases as proof of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4291.3s	4291.3	 something that's not actually true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4293.7s	4293.7	 I mean, this is, I just want to give the press a kind of, I just want to, again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4298.0s	4298.0	 accounting for the press in the last 30 days, one obsessing about every single
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4303.4s	4303.4	 shooting and then inspiring more shootings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4306.6s	4306.6	 When you obsess about these mass shootings, you inspire more of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4310.1s	4310.1	 It is a proven fact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4311.4s	4311.4	 It is inducing people to do this more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4313.8s	4313.8	 It's not exactly correlated, but there is proof about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4318.6s	4318.6	 Same thing with suicides.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4319.7s	4319.7	 That's why we don't cover any young people killing themselves in the Bay Area, in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4323.8s	4323.8	 certain town that we all know had a rash of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4326.7s	4326.7	 Or we don't cover suicides on the Golden Gate Bridge anymore, because when they used
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4330.8s	4330.8	 to cover them and put it on the cover of the Chronicle, two more people would jump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4335.0s	4335.0	 off the next week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4336.1s	4336.1	 Number two, they were obsessing about riots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4339.5s	4339.5	 I mean, I don't know if you turned on the TV during the deliberations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4342.9s	4342.9	 They were absolutely gleeful about the potential of trouble happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4349.3s	4349.3	 And that, of course, incents more people to go out and see what's going on because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4354.1s	4354.1	 you're going to get on TV and because other people are doing it and humans model
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4357.8s	4357.8	 other humans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4359.2s	4359.2	 And then finally, with the goddamn Johnson and Johnson, eight people have blood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4363.2s	4363.2	 cuts. Nobody died.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4364.5s	4364.5	 Am I correct in that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4365.9s	4365.9	 And the one person died, one person died.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4368.0s	4368.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4368.4s	4368.4	 So we don't even know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4369.5s	4369.5	 And then they obsess about that for days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4372.4s	4372.4	 Like, you can't cover these things wall to wall and not think that they you don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4377.6s	4377.6	 have culpability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4378.5s	4378.5	 The CNNs, the Foxes, etc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4380.4s	4380.4	 You're obsessing over these things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4382.1s	4382.1	 And it's scaring people to not take vaccines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4384.0s	4384.0	 It's incenting people who are crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4386.3s	4386.3	 You're dog whistling crazy people to go get a gun and to use that as a way to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4390.0s	4390.0	 famous. And you're doing the same thing, you know, with it, with these, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4395.9s	4395.9	 riots in the streets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4397.3s	4397.3	 We're all in the opinion business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4399.8s	4399.8	 But the problem is when they just when they don't just hype things, but they actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4403.8s	4403.8	 give you factually incorrect information because, you know, it's they're trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4408.0s	4408.0	 scare people into getting higher ratings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4409.8s	4409.8	 You know, fear porn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4410.5s	4410.5	 It's also framing, David, which is a different thing than lying about statistics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4415.0s	4415.0	 They would say we're not lying about the statistics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4416.8s	4416.8	 That's how many people died of covid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4418.6s	4418.6	 But what they're doing is they're framing the cumulative number to make you scared.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4422.2s	4422.2	 Today, 400,000 people have died from covid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4424.5s	4424.5	 It's like, no, over 14 months, 400 people died of covid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4428.1s	4428.1	 700 people died today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4429.3s	4429.3	 And that's the lowest number since November.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4431.3s	4431.3	 But that wouldn't get more people to tune in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4433.1s	4433.1	 Boys, I want to tell you guys something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4434.9s	4434.9	 It's frustrating.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4467.4s	4467.4	 All right, let's wrap here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4468.4s	4468.4	 When we as we wrap what what's going on just because people have been asking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4472.4s	4472.4	 what's going on with the SEC and SPACs and just some more reporting or something?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4476.8s	4476.8	 Because I was watching CNBC and they said, hey, you're doing everything right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4480.1s	4480.1	 But there's a lot of other people doing things wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4482.1s	4482.1	 Explain to us what's going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4483.8s	4483.8	 It's I mean, it's a it's a very specific accounting issue, which is that some SPACs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4489.7s	4489.7	 many SPACs and in fact, many companies, let's just put it that way, not just SPACs, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4493.3s	4493.3	 many companies use warrants and the prevailing guidance on certain warrants was that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4498.2s	4498.2	 they were equity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4500.3s	4500.3	 And basically that gets put into a balance sheet statement where you have equities,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4504.5s	4504.5	 assets and liabilities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4505.7s	4505.7	 And, you know, it's it's on one side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4508.4s	4508.4	 And basically what they said was they issued some refined guidance that said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4512.6s	4512.6	 actually, in these specific cases, these should be really listed as liabilities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4515.8s	4515.8	 So then it needs to move from this column to that column.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4517.9s	4517.9	 But when that when you do that, you go through a bunch of cascading implications
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4523.4s	4523.4	 and effects and revisions and restatements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4526.2s	4526.2	 And so that's what the that's what the entire securities industry is dealing with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4530.0s	4530.0	 right now, which was this guidance by the SEC and the implications.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4534.0s	4534.0	 So that was on the 12th. I mean, just so you know, today we just filed the updated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4538.6s	4538.6	 all of our updated docs plus the updated S4 for SOFI.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4541.8s	4541.8	 So we were able to work around the clock and just kind of get it done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4544.4s	4544.4	 And hopefully what we've also done is create a bit of a way forward and a path
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4549.0s	4549.0	 that other folks can use to kind of like accelerate their their progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4552.1s	4552.1	 But it's definitely created a ton of work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4557.2s	4557.2	 But but I think we're I think we found the right answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4560.4s	4560.4	 So ultimately good for you because you want to see it be buttoned up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4564.8s	4564.8	 Yeah. And also, I think like the simpler path forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4567.0s	4567.0	 So, I mean, if you just think about capital market stability for a moment, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4570.2s	4570.2	 warrant coverage should probably go away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4571.9s	4571.9	 Number one. Right. So take all the warrants to zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4574.6s	4574.6	 Second thing that should happen is that, you know, I think this is an opportunity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4577.9s	4577.9	 to take a step back and figure out how to really make sure that the SPAC sponsors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4581.5s	4581.5	 are of the highest quality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4582.8s	4582.8	 Somebody told me this incredible thing today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4585.0s	4585.0	 I am one of five groups that put up any money when we do a pipe in our deals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4590.2s	4590.2	 Meaning, he said to me, 95 percent of sponsors put up literally a zero
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4594.3s	4594.3	 dollars game, zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4596.7s	4596.7	 And so, of course, you're going to have, you know, extremely loose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4599.4s	4599.4	 underwriting requirements if that's the case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4601.2s	4601.2	 And so, you know, the idea that I'm thinking about, which someone proposed to me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4605.6s	4605.6	 which I think is very clever, is this idea that, you know, you earn more of the promote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4610.8s	4610.8	 more money you put up. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4612.7s	4612.7	 So, for example, like, you know, you know, in so far, I think we put in 275
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4617.4s	4617.4	 million dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4618.9s	4618.9	 So, I mean, we really, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4622.1s	4622.1	 that's a meaningful commitment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4623.3s	4623.3	 And it closes the gap between, you know, what your equity is issued at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4628.5s	4628.5	 and what investors are buying at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4630.0s	4630.0	 And that's very healthy. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4631.7s	4631.7	 And so I think there's all these mechanisms that will clean up this back market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4635.7s	4635.7	 We need to have a much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4638.6s	4638.6	 More refined criteria to allow people to be sponsors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4643.4s	4643.4	 and we need to make sponsors in a position where they must put in money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4648.1s	4648.1	 so that they actually do the work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4650.0s	4650.0	 If you get something for free, let's be honest, you won't do the work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4653.4s	4653.4	 If you're forced to write a check, it's a hundred percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4656.0s	4656.0	 Think about it. Show me an incentive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4657.5s	4657.5	 I'll show you the outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4658.2s	4658.2	 And this happened on Angel List, where in the beginning days of Angel List,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4662.1s	4662.1	 you had some angels, quote unquote, who didn't have any money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4666.1s	4666.1	 So they put a thousand or two thousand into a deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4669.0s	4669.0	 Then they would have five hundred thousand come behind them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4671.2s	4671.2	 And so you had this five hundred to one ratio of dollars to skin in the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4675.8s	4675.8	 And it was like, well, why wouldn't a syndicate lead put every company out there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4680.6s	4680.6	 and not even put it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4682.0s	4682.0	 You know, they have no skin, which is why when you have a venture fund,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4684.2s	4684.2	 I don't know what they expect us to put in typically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4686.2s	4686.2	 Well, the problem is, venture funds are one to two percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4688.6s	4688.6	 I was twenty five percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4690.4s	4690.4	 Well, one to two percent is it can be pretty significant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4692.8s	4692.8	 if you're doing a fund every three years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4694.2s	4694.2	 I'm doing this and it's it winds up being millions of dollars for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4697.0s	4697.0	 But I'm happy to do it because I believe in my own ability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4699.7s	4699.7	 All right. As we wrap, anybody have a plug or anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4701.6s	4701.6	 they want to let people know about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4702.9s	4702.9	 Oh, I want to talk about this one little thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4705.4s	4705.4	 I just not to talk about it, but I would like to tell you guys to read it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4708.0s	4708.0	 because it is so interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4711.1s	4711.1	 Basically, like European soccer tried to incite a revolt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4714.5s	4714.5	 where, like the top teams across all the different leagues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4717.6s	4717.6	 came together to try to create a super league.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4719.9s	4719.9	 But it ended up like they were like a band of evil villains and like fans erupted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4725.0s	4725.0	 Everybody erupted. And then, you know, it existed for 24 hours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4728.5s	4728.5	 But in that 24 hours, it looked like a complete rewriting of sports
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4733.1s	4733.1	 and sports like laws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4735.9s	4735.9	 And, you know, it was an incredible thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4738.6s	4738.6	 There's an article in The New York Times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4739.8s	4739.8	 I'll post it in here. And folks want to read it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4742.6s	4742.6	 It's really, really fucking funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4744.6s	4744.6	 And that will be on season two of Ted Lasso.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4746.9s	4746.9	 I don't know if you guys watched Tim Cook's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4750.2s	4750.2	 keynote this week with the new IMAX, which are really beautiful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4754.3s	4754.3	 He was so excited about Ted Lasso and Ted Lasso is a great show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4758.0s	4758.0	 But I mean, it literally is the the Apple show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4762.1s	4762.1	 You guys see Ted Lasso yet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4763.7s	4763.7	 What is it, the television show?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4765.3s	4765.3	 You guys haven't seen Ted Lasso, the TV show yet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4767.6s	4767.6	 Is it on NBC or CBS?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4769.3s	4769.3	 What channel is it on? TV Plus, whatever that is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4772.5s	4772.5	 Channel six. Is it on Channel six?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4774.5s	4774.5	 TV Plus. You got to go on your Apple TV and then find an Apple TV plus on your TV.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=106&t=4780.1s	4780.1	 And you'll find it eventually.
