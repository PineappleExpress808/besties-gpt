https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey, everybody. Welcome to the All In Podcast with Jason Kallikannis and Chamath Palihapitiya.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=4.4s	4.4	 We record this podcast. Well, on a really unique schedule, Chamath, what's our schedule
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=9.3s	9.3	 right now whenever we feel like it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=11.4s	11.4	 Basically, it is whenever our significant others get so sick of us that they kick us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=16.6s	16.6	 off and say, don't come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=18.0s	18.0	 Yeah, we get thrown to the pool house. We decide to pop up the podcast. You're in Atherton.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=23.8s	23.8	 I am in the city in San Francisco.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=26.2s	26.2	 Thank you, Duke of Discretion. Is there anything else you'd like to do? Tell them by address.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=30.2s	30.2	 By gate code.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=31.2s	31.2	 Gate code off the fence. We had two guests on that people just went absolutely crazy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=39.0s	39.0	 for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=40.0s	40.0	 But they weren't available, so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=41.0s	41.0	 So we're just going to talk shit about them. No, we have two amazing Davids in our lives,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=46.6s	46.6	 David Friedberg and David Sacks. And they are super smart, super effective at their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=52.5s	52.5	 work. Everything, we're not, Chamath. And so we bring them back on the podcast and we'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=56.9s	56.9	 do a little roundtable here and talk about life in the age of Corona. So welcome back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=61.7s	61.7	 to the podcast, David Sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=63.7s	63.7	 Yeah, good to be back with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=67.3s	67.3	 And also David Friedberg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=69.3s	69.3	 Thank you guys. Happy to be here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=71.2s	71.2	 All right. Fantastic. So I just want to start off with our choir check. How is everybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=76.7s	76.7	 doing in this quarantine? How's everybody's mental health? Let's start with you, Sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=82.9s	82.9	 Well, as you might be able to see, we've moved our bunker to an undisclosed Mexican
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=88.7s	88.7	 location. You know, and it's been great. You know, we, you know, I think it's really kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=98.2s	98.2	 of sad because where we're at is a tourist city that would normally be at peak season
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=104.3s	104.3	 and it's just deserted right now. All the construction stopped. Normally you see lots
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=109.5s	109.5	 of hotels and houses being built and that's all stopped. And there's no tourists. So it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=115.8s	115.8	 all just kind of cleared out. But I think it's quite safe. You know, every worker that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=122.2s	122.2	 I've seen here since we landed at the airport to, you know, got transported to the community
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=128.8s	128.8	 we're at, I mean, has been wearing a mask, much more consistent than I think in the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=134.4s	134.4	 And you know, I think it's been fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=138.1s	138.1	 Now, of course, you founded the Kraft Venture Capital firm and people know before that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=144.3s	144.3	 obviously did Yammer and sold that to Microsoft for a billion dollars plus. And before that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=148.7s	148.7	 you are the COO at PayPal. What's going on with your business? Are you actively investing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=154.0s	154.0	 And how is your firm running remote?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=160.9s	160.9	 It's worked very well. I mean, we've always been super collaborative as a firm. We were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=167.7s	167.7	 already on Zoom and we share everything on Yammer. And so for us, just moving to Zoom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=174.7s	174.7	 wasn't that difficult. We've done four or five deals, I think, since the whole kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=179.7s	179.7	 of quarantine started.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=181.7s	181.7	 I'm sorry, sorry, sorry. Did you say that you actually use Yammer now in 2020?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=186.3s	186.3	 We're still using it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=187.3s	187.3	 Oh my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=188.3s	188.3	 Is Yammer still available?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=190.3s	190.3	 That's insane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=192.3s	192.3	 I mean, it's kind of gotten a little bit buried inside of Microsoft, but you can certainly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=195.5s	195.5	 still get it. And no, we love it. I mean, the whole firm kind of works in Yammer and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=202.1s	202.1	 it works very well for us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=203.3s	203.3	 And now what's going to happen with this incredible office that you have, this beautiful office
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=206.8s	206.8	 you have in San Francisco and commercial real estate now that are you going to come back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=211.2s	211.2	 to work? We saw Twitter and Square, the Jack collection of companies, they're not going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=216.4s	216.4	 to come back to their offices. They work from home primarily going forward. What are you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=220.0s	220.0	 going to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=221.3s	221.3	 Well, it'll be a great asset for us in the year 2025 or something like that. No, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=226.8s	226.8	 we will eventually go back to work there. I think that the team still likes having an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=231.8s	231.8	 office. I think the idea that everyone wants to work out of like a small room and extra
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=237.4s	237.4	 room in their house, I think it's probably getting, it's probably a little overrated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=241.1s	241.1	 I think people would like to get back to the office. But do we have to have one? No. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=247.7s	247.7	 think we've proven that we can do our jobs via Zoom. And we've done a lot of, we've done,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=254.7s	254.7	 like I said, we've done four or five deals since this started where we haven't met with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=258.5s	258.5	 the entrepreneur in person. It's all been done via Zoom and it's worked great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=263.2s	263.2	 All right, Chamath, how are you doing? What's your mental health like? I get to see you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=268.2s	268.2	 once in a while on CNBC throwing bombs, but how are you doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=275.2s	275.2	 I was really excited for phase two of the shelter in place to start here in San Mateo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=284.8s	284.8	 County. So that's been really good. A new poker table that I had built arrived today,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=291.8s	291.8	 which I'll be installing after this. And what I mean by I'll be installing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=296.4s	296.4	 You'll be supervising.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=298.2s	298.2	 I'll be supervising.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=299.3s	299.3	 You'll be watching as people do real work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=301.4s	301.4	 I'll be watching. And-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=302.3s	302.3	 It's a beautiful table. I saw the pictures of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=305.3s	305.3	 Is it an infinity edge poker table?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=308.1s	308.1	 No, no, no, no, but I'll send you a picture when it's all done, but it just looks stunning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=312.9s	312.9	 And I really want to try to organize the game soon so that I can get you guys back into the,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=318.9s	318.9	 into my little cave here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=320.1s	320.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=321.3s	321.3	 I am ready for this shelter in place to end. I'll just be honest. And I think that my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=326.8s	326.8	 sentiments are the sentiments of a lot of people. It's really tough. Really, really tough. I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=332.4s	332.4	 losing all my motivation to be quite honest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=335.1s	335.1	 It is weird to not see people even, and you're an extrovert, David, you're an introvert, and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=341.7s	341.7	 David Friedberg also on the line. David, how are you handling all of this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=347.9s	347.9	 I'm fine. I think one of the things that made a huge difference for me is the creating a rhythm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=352.9s	352.9	 in the day. Cause there isn't one when you kind of normally get up and you go to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=357.9s	357.9	 and then you come home at the end of the day from work. That's a rhythm and you're, you kind of get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=362.9s	362.9	 adjusted to it. So not having that a lot of people I've been hearing are struggling with that. I was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=366.4s	366.4	 certainly struggling with it, having sleep issues. And I sit on about a dozen boards, some of which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=372.8s	372.8	 are small companies, some of which have a couple hundred employees. And I've been hearing pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=376.3s	376.3	 consistently mental health issues across all the companies. And I think it's just been really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=381.5s	381.5	 grating on people. I think it number one kind of says we probably do need to be together and have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=386.8s	386.8	 social space. As David said, like being in the same office, people really miss that and you get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=391.1s	391.1	 a lot of value from that. And I've been getting up every day in the last couple of weeks and going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=398.0s	398.0	 off site, going out of my house to go work. We're actually working on another place and I have like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=402.6s	402.6	 a little office there and I go kind of work there. And so that's made a huge impact honestly on my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=406.9s	406.9	 mental health, being able to do that every day. So just doing that's been helpful. Not everyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=412.1s	412.1	 has that privilege, but I think it speaks a lot to why we're going to need to go back to offices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=416.1s	416.1	 And what do you think about what's happening with your businesses? Obviously you're running
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=421.5s	421.5	 a startup studio, I guess would be one way to describe it, where you create companies and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=425.2s	425.2	 spin them out. What's been the business interruption, if any? We have a couple of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=430.3s	430.3	 hardware and lab companies. That's most of what we've done. And so those operations are paused.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=435.2s	435.2	 So that's been really frustrating. The teams have all found ways to adjust and work from home. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=438.8s	438.8	 our companies are not predominantly software-based. There's a lot of software, but it's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=443.6s	443.6	 predominantly software. So it's been difficult on those scientists and engineers that work in a lab
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=448.4s	448.4	 or in a physical environment that they have to go to to do their work. The larger companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=453.0s	453.0	 we have a number of food businesses that happen to be in the food supply chain one way or another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=457.6s	457.6	 Frankly, those businesses are doing fantastically well. And there's been just this incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=462.4s	462.4	 success in the era of COVID on kind of a focus on fundamentals like food, supply chain efficiency,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=468.8s	468.8	 availability of things that people need. And we were doing a lot in human health and we've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=473.2s	473.2	 kind of benefited from that. So yeah, I think it's kind of a mix for us that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=478.7s	478.7	 I think every business is bifurcated one way or another during this kind of moment of punctuated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=483.2s	483.2	 equilibrium. Yeah, I think one thing I'd like to sort of talk about is we had you both on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=488.1s	488.1	 podcast early on at the start of the pandemic. And I'm curious, Chamath, now that we're here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=495.1s	495.1	 over two months in quarantine, sheltering in place and a lot of information, a lot of cards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=500.0s	500.0	 have turned over here, right? We've seen the flop, I think. We haven't seen the turn in the river,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=504.6s	504.6	 so to speak. What is your assessment of what we were talking about a month or two ago and what we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=511.6s	511.6	 thought about this and what's become reality and what hasn't? What are you more optimistic about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=516.0s	516.0	 What are you more pessimistic about? Chamath, let's start with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=519.2s	519.2	 I think that we will have this pandemic or this disease well in hand within two years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=530.8s	530.8	 And so whether it's a combination of a therapeutic and a vaccine or just a therapeutic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=537.3s	537.3	 I just think that we're going to kick its ass. And so that's made me more optimistic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=542.4s	542.4	 I think that the thing that's made me more pessimistic, though, is the return to normalcy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=549.2s	549.2	 has been sort of cut on political lines. And it's been so massively politicized. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=555.5s	555.5	 when David talks about the fact that you can go to a developing country like Mexico and all of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=560.8s	560.8	 sudden everybody can get around the idea of masks, it's because that there's a level of common sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=566.1s	566.1	 there that trumps politics. And in the United States, that just isn't the case. And so what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=572.6s	572.6	 you're seeing in this crazy way, I think, is sort of the center left and the left
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=580.6s	580.6	 probably sticking very firmly to the ideology of sheltering in place and a lockdown,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=587.8s	587.8	 probably on the sort of hope that it gets Trump out of office. And on the other side,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=593.6s	593.6	 the red states, I think, have basically said, hey, I would rather get sick from coronavirus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=600.0s	600.0	 and take my chances than the 100% chance of failure that I have in my professional life if you leave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=605.6s	605.6	 me at home for another week or month or what have you. So that's been a huge disappointment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=611.9s	611.9	 of how political this whole thing has gotten. And, Sax, you've been talking about common sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=616.8s	616.8	 procedures. Sort of same question to you. What you first thought, and you had been talking about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=622.3s	622.3	 you thought, an L-shaped recovery. So we'll get into also the economy here. But in terms of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=626.9s	626.9	 disease, what did you think two months ago that you don't think now and what do you think? Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=634.1s	634.1	 Yeah. Well, in preparation for this, I kind of went through my Twitter feed to see what I was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=639.1s	639.1	 saying the last time I was on the pod and how well it was holding up. And two months ago today,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=645.0s	645.0	 I tweeted that the pandemic, that underreaction caused the pandemic and overreaction will cause
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=651.5s	651.5	 the depression. And I think that's kind of where we are right now. We still have this pandemic with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=657.9s	657.9	 us, but now we're also potentially facing, I think, a potential depression because of the way we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=663.6s	663.6	 overreacting. We're still in lockdowns and huge swaths of the country. And no one can quite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=673.2s	673.2	 understand why. I mean, the original reason for the lockdowns was to bias time so that the hospitals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=679.1s	679.1	 wouldn't become overwhelmed like Italy. Well, nowhere in the country did the hospitals get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=683.5s	683.5	 overwhelmed and we're still in these lockdowns. And so I think that it's long overdue for it to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=692.3s	692.3	 end. Now, at the same time, where I agree with Tramath that this whole thing has become politicized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=697.7s	697.7	 where the people who generally want to get us out of lockdowns don't believe in doing anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=706.0s	706.0	 A lot of them aren't even willing to wear masks, which I think is just kind of insane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=712.4s	712.4	 So where I come out on this thing is that I think we should end lockdowns but wear masks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=717.2s	717.2	 And it's very hard to find anybody in the political spectrum who agrees with that because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=724.8s	724.8	 one side wants to keep lockdowns going indefinitely and the other doesn't want us to wear masks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=730.0s	730.0	 And it makes no logical sense, obviously. And if you think about our political system,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=734.1s	734.1	 the left is so far left that the moderates on the left side don't have a place to live anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=739.3s	739.3	 And then on the right, the conservatives, which I would put you in, the group of who were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=745.2s	745.2	 looking for fiscal conservatives, they don't have a home anymore either. And so the most reasonable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=753.4s	753.4	 approach is clearly to start going back to work for people who are not at risk and who wear a mask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=761.3s	761.3	 Yeah, I think there's been since the last pod that we did together, I think there's been three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=766.4s	766.4	 kind of major discoveries or sets of facts that have come out about the virus. Number one,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=774.0s	774.0	 the official fatality rate has been over, which is about 6%. You know, it's a very high fatality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=780.3s	780.3	 rate. It's pretty scary. But we now know that that's overstated by probably at least 10x
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=787.7s	787.7	 because it doesn't take into account all the asymptomatic cases or mild cases
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=793.0s	793.0	 that just never got tested. And this is the fatality rate of people who contracted the virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=798.5s	798.5	 Right. Yes, exactly. As opposed to people whose case... The problem with the... It's kind of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=805.2s	805.2	 debate between the IFR versus the CFR, the infection fatality rate versus the case fatality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=810.4s	810.4	 rate. The problem with kind of the official CFR numbers is that only the people who got really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=816.2s	816.2	 sick never got tested. And you know, Freeberg was the earliest person I know to start talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=824.2s	824.2	 the need for wide scale population testing and these blood serology tests and other kinds of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=829.3s	829.3	 tests to establish what the real baseline is. But regardless of like... And there's been a whole bunch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=834.2s	834.2	 of different tests with different results. We don't know exactly what the true IFR is to this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=841.4s	841.4	 day, but we do know it's probably closer to half a percent than to 5%. So that's sort of discovery
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=849.0s	849.0	 number one. I think discovery number two is... And we knew a little bit... We saw a little bit of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=854.6s	854.6	 from the Wuhan data, but now it's really clear that which populations are at risk. And it's...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=861.4s	861.4	 You know, the data seems to suggest that people under 60 who are healthy don't have sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=867.1s	867.1	 pre-existing conditions are 50 times less likely to develop or... There's a 50x greater chance for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=875.6s	875.6	 those over 60 in terms of having a really bad outcome. And so for people under 60 who don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=882.8s	882.8	 have these pre-existing conditions, it's just not... Yes, there's always examples to the contrary,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=889.1s	889.1	 but it's not this sort of gigantic risk. And so for two-thirds of the population,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=895.4s	895.4	 they don't have a huge risk and we're still locking them down. I think the third study...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=902.2s	902.2	 Not just study... There's been studies and there's been models, and then we've also seen practice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=907.2s	907.2	 is that wide-scale use of masks or ubiquitous mask wearing is sufficient to control the virus,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=915.6s	915.6	 meaning to stop the exponentiality of the virus. We've seen in the Asian countries or Czech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=922.0s	922.0	 Slovakia, other places, they've been able to get the so-called R0, the viral coefficient,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=930.4s	930.4	 to go below one with wide-scale use of masks. And so we have a way to prevent the virus from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=936.9s	936.9	 going exponential that doesn't require lockdowns. And so the thing I blogged about the last time I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=944.8s	944.8	 was on your show was, why would you do this most severe thing, these lockdowns, and not do this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=950.7s	950.7	 easy thing that's just merely inconvenient, which is masks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=953.9s	953.9	 Freberg, when you look at it and you're the, I think, have the deepest science,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=956.9s	956.9	 clearly, of the deepest science background of all of us, how do you look at this pandemic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=964.7s	964.7	 now that we're 75 days into it here in the Bay Area, and obviously, this started in December,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=970.0s	970.0	 it looks like, in China? What's your take on it now? What did you get right early, and what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=976.0s	976.0	 have you changed your mind about recently? I think I'm actually funny. When you say that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=981.9s	981.9	 I just pulled up the original WHO joint mission on COVID final report. And the date of this report,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=989.2s	989.2	 by the way, is February 20th. So there was this big thing they published 40 pages long from the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=994.0s	994.0	 WHO. And in it, they highlighted this fatality rate estimate inside of Wuhan and outside of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1002.2s	1002.2	 Hubei. We knew from this data very early on that we were at about a half percent fatality rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1008.9s	1008.9	 And then we saw all of this other stuff happen with Korea and the Princess cruise ship and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1014.4s	1014.4	 NBA players very early on. We saw all these people that were roughly asymptomatic. And we're starting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1019.5s	1019.5	 to get two kind of explanations for why that is. But from the beginning, I felt really like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1024.8s	1024.8	 you know, this is going to be a largely asymptomatic kind of spreading infectious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1031.0s	1031.0	 factor. What I got wrong was when we went into lockdown, I don't know, Chamath, if you remember
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1036.0s	1036.0	 this, when we talked the first time on Jason's podcast, I asked you guys, or you guys asked me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1041.8s	1041.8	 when I thought we'd be back. And I was like, oh, April 7th, we'll be back to work. And I also had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1046.0s	1046.0	 a bet going with you guys. And I said, we're going to have less than 20,000 deaths in the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1049.8s	1049.8	 I so overestimated the effectiveness of the lockdown. And I think that was kind of, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1056.0s	1056.0	 one of the more kind of like, striking things to me is the quote unquote lockdown. And I just sent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1061.7s	1061.7	 the video to Nick, Nick, do you have it? Can you queue it up? So basically, I, this is what I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1066.8s	1066.8	 has happened in the United States, like pull this thing up. I was in Berkeley on Saturday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1070.9s	1070.9	 And I went to play to meet some buddies and we played frisbee golf on campus and had a beer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1075.2s	1075.2	 some college buddies of mine. And so I'm walking around in Berkeley and there is frat party after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1080.0s	1080.0	 frat party going on. No mast, everyone's on top of each other. You can see the video right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1084.9s	1084.9	 I took a video of one of the parties. Yeah, they're all paying beer pong. There's like girls
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1089.0s	1089.0	 and drinking and people are passing around bottles of vodka. And there's no mast. And this was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1093.1s	1093.1	 entire campus of Berkeley, like, and I think this is what's gone on like around the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1097.3s	1097.3	 So the belief that you could just kind of like lock away the virus, I believe like, oh my God,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1102.6s	1102.6	 it's so extreme. It's so draconian. We're going to shut down the world and this thing is going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1106.4s	1106.4	 to get stopped in 30 days, like happened in China. That is not what happened in the United States of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1111.0s	1111.0	 America. Like people want to be free. People want to party. People want to live their life. They want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1114.5s	1114.5	 to go to work. They want to see their friends and family and they're not used to being told no by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1119.1s	1119.1	 the government. And so I think that's been, to me, the biggest surprise is just like how ineffective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1124.7s	1124.7	 the quote unquote lockdown has been. And I think it really speaks to the need that David mentioned,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1129.0s	1129.0	 which is this lockdown isn't binary. You can't just say lock everyone down or let them all out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1133.6s	1133.6	 You've got a nuance your way to a solution, which means like masks, which means watching out for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1138.4s	1138.4	 nursing homes, which means temperature checking before letting people in the buildings of over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1141.8s	1141.8	 a hundred people, like all the stuff that I think needs to be done for this to be kind of effective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1147.2s	1147.2	 at tracking and tracing. And we can't just assume that a quote unquote lockdown is going to keep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1153.8s	1153.8	 people inside and keep this thing from spreading because the frat party, as you'll see, is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1157.1s	1157.1	 perfect representation of what's really going on out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1160.4s	1160.4	 All right. Circling back around to you, Chamath, what do you think of what the two David sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1166.0s	1166.0	 outlined there in terms of the path forward and how we all handicapped what was going on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1173.5s	1173.5	 Well, I think the reality is that by hook or crook, we're going to basically exit this lockdown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1181.8s	1181.8	 sooner than we think, because I think people just can't take it anymore. So there's no point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1186.4s	1186.4	 in having a shelter in place order if everybody's running around playing beer pong. And so it's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1191.8s	1191.8	 doing anything. And so you might as well get the productive value of the economy going again by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1199.2s	1199.2	 letting people go back to work. And just finding some simple ways that people can look past
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1209.0s	1209.0	 the politics and just do the right thing. Wear a goddamn mask and shut the fuck up and go back to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1214.9s	1214.9	 work. It's really like, I mean, when you think about it, it's like, why is this such a big deal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1222.2s	1222.2	 Get everything you want and just put a little bit of cloth over your face. I mean, a lot of the folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1227.2s	1227.2	 that push back on this, you know, they're better off wearing the mask. Yeah, I mean, it is pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1234.5s	1234.5	 striking when you watch the protests and you see a bunch of people who are, you know, obviously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1239.3s	1239.3	 older and obviously obese. Those are not the best looking knives in the drawer. Let's just put it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1244.0s	1244.0	 that way. Definitely not. And- A little dull and rusty is what I would say. Well, and, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1248.5s	1248.5	 they're carrying guns and they've never served a day in the army. I mean, they're literally cosplaying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1253.8s	1253.8	 Marines. I have nothing to say about that. All I'm saying is this whole mask thing is not such a big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1259.0s	1259.0	 deal. Just if you can wear a mask and get back to being productive and get back to a job, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1263.9s	1263.9	 you should be allowed to. All right. So we had a big debate, V-shaped, W-shaped, U-shaped, L-shaped,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1269.7s	1269.7	 recovery. I was in the, I'm aspirationally V-shaped, but I'm expecting a U. Saks you were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1276.0s	1276.0	 the L and I think Chamath you were the W, the U or the L. We've had a V. How do you explain, Chamath,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1283.1s	1283.1	 what is going on in the stock market? Because you said it was the end of days. You said this is going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1288.4s	1288.4	 to be a disaster. Is it going to be a disaster? Is this the end of the days and we've got some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1293.0s	1293.0	 false rebound and this V-shaped recovery is not sustainable? How do you explain this-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1299.1s	1299.1	 I think there's- Inexplainable V-shaped response. There's two things to keep in mind. First of all,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1305.5s	1305.5	 the economy is completely fucked. So don't look at Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1313.4s	1313.4	 and a handful of internet SaaS companies and kid yourself. We have 30 million American men and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1320.0s	1320.0	 women out of work. That is every fifth person you see walking down the street does not have a job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1325.6s	1325.6	 What happens when lockdown ends? If the lockdown ends in June as expected for most people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1330.7s	1330.7	 how many people are- How many repound? Yeah. No. So look, here's the thing that we've had. We've had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1337.3s	1337.3	 trillions of dollars of money printed into the system. And when you print that money into the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1343.3s	1343.3	 system, which the Federal Reserve has done, it hits the asset markets and it has basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1349.2s	1349.2	 stabilized the bond market and the incremental dollar sits in the hands of an individual
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1355.9s	1355.9	 who must put the money to work. Because when you look back at this, this is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1361.2s	1361.2	 a random person managing their 401k. The overwhelming majority of the money sits in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1365.7s	1365.7	 the hands of hedge funds or pension funds or sovereign wealth funds or mutual funds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1370.9s	1370.9	 They have a job to do. And so you have to think about what is their incremental decision. So even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1376.5s	1376.5	 if the stock market made no sense on any valuation metric, the incremental dollar that they have,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1382.4s	1382.4	 which they're paid to put to work, will get put to work. And so what you've actually seen is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1388.0s	1388.0	 dispersion. And what I mean by that is if you graph the S&P 500 index versus the unweighted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1396.5s	1396.5	 S&P 500 index, which basically means the first one ranks companies by market cap and gives the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1402.5s	1402.5	 biggest companies more weight, the other one ranks every company equally. There's been a massive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1407.8s	1407.8	 split, a dispersion. And what it really shows is that companies that traffic in bits,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1414.1s	1414.1	 so software businesses, have a bid and companies that traffic in atoms have gotten completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1419.1s	1419.1	 decimated and they are literally worthless. And so when you put all these things together,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1425.4s	1425.4	 the real economy is in the toilet. There are tens of millions of men and women out of work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1431.7s	1431.7	 The earnings power of real companies that do physical things in the world are cheaper and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1437.6s	1437.6	 lower than they've ever been. Meanwhile, the companies that have high velocity, high margin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1444.4s	1444.4	 software driven businesses have gone to the moon. So it's unfair to look at 30 or 40 businesses and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1451.6s	1451.6	 paint that as a V-shaped recovery. It is a equity market that is buoyed by Fed dollars that is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1458.0s	1458.0	 mapping to the reality of what's happening on the ground. Okay. So Sachs, you're pretty plugged into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1464.1s	1464.1	 the economy and you think about this a lot. What do you think the recovery looks like? Is this going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1468.8s	1468.8	 to be two, three, four, five quarter recession? Is it going to be depression era like some people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1475.0s	1475.0	 are apt to say? What keeps you up at night thinking about the economy and what gives you hope?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1481.4s	1481.4	 Well, it kind of depends if there are other shoes to drop. So I agree with Tramath that the state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1488.5s	1488.5	 of the economy right now is terrible and it's divorced from the financial markets because of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1493.6s	1493.6	 all the money printing and interventions that the Fed and Treasury have been doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1501.9s	1501.9	 One way to think about it is, well, the stock market's denominated in US dollars. And if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1508.1s	1508.1	 they just printed a whole bunch more of them, those dollars are worth less. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1513.3s	1513.3	 the price of the stocks are going to rise. But yeah, I think looking forward,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1521.2s	1521.2	 it's probably going to be a two to three year process to get out of this unless some other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1525.2s	1525.2	 shoe drops, which could make it much worse. So you're betting on two to three years to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1530.9s	1530.9	 back to let's call it single digit unemployment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1536.3s	1536.3	 Well, let's see, we're at like, what, 15% right now or something like that. So,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1543.3s	1543.3	 35 million people get down to, you know, 10 million again, 20 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1549.5s	1549.5	 It's hard to say it's going to take a long time to create all those jobs. You know, a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1552.4s	1552.4	 these businesses are not just going to come racing right back. So, you know, I think it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1558.9s	1558.9	 probably like a two to three year process to get back to some sort of, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1562.1s	1562.1	 And by the way, the thing you have to remember is like, look, the unemployment numbers that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1566.0s	1566.0	 have had in the last probably seven or eight years, so during Obama and Trump, have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1571.0s	1571.0	 completely manipulated because the number of people that are entirely leaving the workforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1576.7s	1576.7	 is quite high. And so, you know, it's not just a numerator problem, we have a denominator problem,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1581.7s	1581.7	 too. There are fewer and fewer workers that, you know, are willing to work because some of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1586.5s	1586.5	 just give up. Right. Or it's just not worth it for the pay that's available is another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1591.5s	1591.5	 stated reason. So, the thing that we're going to have to figure out is like, how many of the people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1595.0s	1595.0	 that are leaving the workforce may never come back. And that has a societal toll and weight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1601.3s	1601.3	 that we all have to bear. Yeah, there's going to be a lot of people who maybe are in their 60s,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1606.4s	1606.4	 or maybe even late 50s, they got 10, 20 years left, that they could be working in management
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1612.3s	1612.3	 sales, whatever it is. And they just say, you know what, it's not worth it. I'm going to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1617.7s	1617.7	 try to find a place to stay and maybe not rejoin the workforce. Early retirement or just capitulation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1624.0s	1624.0	 Yeah. Well, and but, you know, remember I said about other shoes dropping. I mean, we're still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1631.0s	1631.0	 in the early, I think we're still in the early stages seeing the repercussions of what, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1637.4s	1637.4	 that two or three months shut down the economy, you know, what that's going to look like. And so,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1643.2s	1643.2	 the, you know, the wave of defaults is just beginning. And, you know, who knows what happens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1647.9s	1647.9	 with cities and states and so on down the line. I mean, who knows, you know, do the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1654.5s	1654.5	 debt markets have kind of an inexhaustible, you know, desire for to, you know, to buy US debt,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1661.5s	1661.5	 or could we reach some sort of saturation point? And then that triggers the next, you know, set of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1668.3s	1668.3	 crises. So we just, you know, I would say like the two to three year outlook is the one that's kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1674.4s	1674.4	 of like what it looks like today. But if there are these other big shoes to drop, it could turn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1680.1s	1680.1	 it something much worse. I think Friedberg, we're all in agreement that there will be a second wave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1685.4s	1685.4	 of some type. It just depends on how big the spike is. Do you think there'll be another New York City
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1690.6s	1690.6	 level outbreak where we'll see, you know, 2000 people, 1500 people dying in a certain region
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1696.3s	1696.3	 every day for some sustained period of time? What are the chances of that happening, Friedberg?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1700.2s	1700.2	 I don't know. I mean, I think going forward, the, you know, the New York situation, people's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1706.0s	1706.0	 behaviors have been shocked. So, you know, to the points earlier, the most effective thing you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1710.6s	1710.6	 do is stop coughing on your hand, touching a railing, someone else touches the railing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1714.7s	1714.7	 and touches their mouth. I mean, that's kind of how this goes. You know, there's been early on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1721.6s	1721.6	 some weird like aerosolized studies that they've kind of said, hey, this thing spreads in the air
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1727.8s	1727.8	 and so on. It's really, you know, you got to be in a closed kind of confined space. So people are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1732.0s	1732.0	 wearing masks now. So the likelihood of the transmission happening at the rate that we saw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1736.5s	1736.5	 in New York, great paper out of MIT, by the way, that shows how this happened on the subway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1741.6s	1741.6	 Oh, really? Identify the subway as kind of the primary vector that drove transmission in New
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1747.2s	1747.2	 York City. That was always my thesis. And I remember talking about it and saying, how is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1752.4s	1752.4	 this not obvious to everybody that 8 million people ride that thing every day or something?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1755.6s	1755.6	 Like it's so obvious. They did an incredible job proving it. So it's not like people running in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1759.6s	1759.6	 Central Park or spreading coronavirus to each other. It's everyone in these confined spaces,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1762.7s	1762.7	 coughing in the air, and then you kind of get this stuff. And 20 people get on and off at every stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1767.3s	1767.3	 That's the other thing people don't realize is that it's not just a bunch of people. It's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1771.0s	1771.0	 an airplane where you have X number of people going in one direction for three, four, five hours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1776.0s	1776.0	 This is 20 people getting on and off every five minutes. It's almost like you couldn't design a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1780.5s	1780.5	 better incubator for it. And I don't think a city in the United States approaches the density that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1785.6s	1785.6	 you have in New York. So remember, these are not deterministic factors. There's like a spectrum of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1790.5s	1790.5	 probabilistic spectrum here. So you have a lot of people, they have a certain type of behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1794.9s	1794.9	 they're not wearing masks, you kind of add these up and you end up with this really high kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1798.6s	1798.6	 vector that drives this, this rapid spread. As we saw in New York City, you're not going to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1804.0s	1804.0	 that in Dallas, you're not going to see that in Houston, you're not going to see that in San Diego,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1807.4s	1807.4	 you're going to have more of the slow steady burn as some risk is taken in the environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1812.0s	1812.0	 some risk is taken by frat parties and people not wearing masks and people touching their mouth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1816.6s	1816.6	 but it's not going to have the same sort of massive effect you saw in New York. So I wouldn't expect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1820.8s	1820.8	 us to have a New York style second wave. I do expect there to continue to be this like slow burn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1826.8s	1826.8	 going forward of new cases. And it's certainly going to be more obvious now that we're testing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1830.7s	1830.7	 a lot more. And so Chamath at this point, we're basically putting a price on life and saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1836.6s	1836.6	 hey, some amount of deaths is worth taking the risk. And as Americans, a unique group of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1843.4s	1843.4	 in the world and how we look at personal freedom, Americans are just making the choice. Hey, listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1848.9s	1848.9	 if you don't want to take the risk, stay home. But the rest of us, if we want to take the risk,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1852.2s	1852.2	 we're going to go take the risk. That's what this has come down to in your mind, Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1855.6s	1855.6	 Yeah, I think that it's very difficult for Americans to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1863.7s	1863.7	 envision a world where like, you know, their personal freedoms are infringed upon. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1867.7s	1867.7	 it's sort of like kind of one of the founding principles of the entire country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1872.0s	1872.0	 This is why I think that the tragedy of this thing is that the way to get everybody what they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1877.7s	1877.7	 is so simple. As David said, it's like, you know, above 65, you stay home, you work remotely,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1883.3s	1883.3	 under 65, you temperature check and wear a mask. And, you know, you're 95% of the way there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1888.0s	1888.0	 but it's become a left versus right decision to do it. You know, the mask wearers are still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1892.7s	1892.7	 in a lockdown and the non mask wearers want to get back to work. And basically, like there's,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1898.5s	1898.5	 it's just another kind of culture war between the left and the right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1904.8s	1904.8	 It's really just shocking to me. I mean, for what it's worth, you know, if I was,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1909.6s	1909.6	 I am a betting man, so I'll just tell you, you know, my line now is that I think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1914.8s	1914.8	 Donald Trump is overwhelmingly likely to win as a function of people's frustration about the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1921.3s	1921.3	 lockdowns. And I think that the Democrats best hope of winning in November is ending these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1927.1s	1927.1	 sooner rather than later. It's amazing. We're talking about a pandemic, a once in a hundred
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1933.2s	1933.2	 year pandemic, it looks like, and we're literally looking at our reaction to it through the lens of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1940.0s	1940.0	 this president being reelected or not. Like literally that's the determining factor on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1944.1s	1944.1	 advice we're giving to people. We're telling people they can't go to the beach, but they can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1948.1s	1948.1	 be on an airplane. They can't go to the Tesla factory, but they can ride the subway. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1953.2s	1953.2	 on a communication basis, is there any worse way we could have communicated this to the populace?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1959.7s	1959.7	 Well, the communication was bad, but the, I think the bigger problem, quite honestly, is that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1964.8s	1964.8	 Republican democratic governors in the United States can't get on the same page. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1969.9s	1969.9	 at the same time, there's just a tendency to support Donald Trump or not support him in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1975.8s	1975.8	 very reflexive instinctive way that isn't helpful right now. And there just doesn't seem to be enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1983.0s	1983.0	 political wherewithal and courage to just stand up and do the right thing, independent of what your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1989.7s	1989.7	 political persuasion is. But I think on the margin now, I think you have different but very similar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=1996.8s	1996.8	 boundary conditions to 2016, where there are all these people that kind of like told you one thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2002.4s	2002.4	 and did another. There are all these people right now that probably are preference falsifying as we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2007.5s	2007.5	 speak. And they'll show up into the voting booth and they'll be angry if they're not back in their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2011.6s	2011.6	 jobs, especially if they've been laid off as a result of not being able to get back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2016.9s	2016.9	 And they would blame that on the Democrats, not the Republicans, and therefore Trump gets his next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2021.6s	2021.6	 term. Well, because the it's the democratic states that are pushing the hardest basically,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2026.8s	2026.8	 like, you know, you saw the craziness in Los Angeles, but like, you know, Eric Garcetti was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2031.2s	2031.2	 basically like, we will enter the shelter in place and, you know, December of 2022. And it's like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2037.3s	2037.3	 it's Los Angeles. Yeah, it's not gonna happen. You know, players got to play. I mean, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2042.3s	2042.3	 this is just as unbelievable. Yeah, well, the, the I do, I agree, the lockdowns, the or the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2049.9s	2049.9	 unwillingness to end the lockdowns gives Trump an issue for November, assuming this continues,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2058.4s	2058.4	 that supersedes the incompetence of the COVID response, which is that, you know, our lives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2066.1s	2066.1	 and livelihoods are not owned by politicians to, you know, meter out and give back to us in drips
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2073.8s	2073.8	 and drabs. And as they see fit, that is the issue that the lockdown crowd is giving to Trump. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2080.3s	2080.3	 I do think it will, if it's still the issue in November, it will supersede the, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2085.5s	2085.5	 the initial incompetence of the COVID response. And what did you think of this whole, what's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2092.0s	2092.0	 drug that Trump said he was taking David Sachs? I draw hydroxychloroquine. Yeah. So, or a free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2098.1s	2098.1	 drug, maybe you take it. We talked about that early on. And that I think you properly said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2104.3s	2104.3	 like, if you took it early, this could be, you know, could has potential taking it later,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2108.4s	2108.4	 it's probably too late. I think you nailed that on the pod last time. Why has this become such
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2112.8s	2112.8	 a political issue? And what are your thoughts on that drug specifically, and its potential efficacy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2119.3s	2119.3	 Look, I'm not a doctor. But it, from what I understand, is there is a, so just so you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2127.6s	2127.6	 there's like side effects to this drug for a small percentage of the population. And this drug can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2132.4s	2132.4	 actually inhibit energy production in certain cells, which can cause organs to dysfunction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2139.1s	2139.1	 And it particularly shows up in the heart. So people end up with what's called a long QT interval,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2144.6s	2144.6	 and potentially some heart issues that can be pretty dangerous and deadly, depending on your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2149.8s	2149.8	 body. So it's really a little bit of an unknown. There's also issues longer term with vision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2154.5s	2154.5	 impairment can damage your retinal cells and cause vision loss. So there's risk to this drug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2159.3s	2159.3	 It's not like taking, you know, an Advil. It is a it is a measured risk. It's a low probability,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2165.6s	2165.6	 but the severity can be high. And so typically, with a scenario like that, doctors and scientists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2171.3s	2171.3	 like to see, you know, phased clinical trials, and you kind of do, you know, randomized, and you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2178.0s	2178.0	 placebo and testing. And so that hasn't necessarily been done for this particular virus, this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2183.0s	2183.0	 particular condition. And often, the design of those studies matters a lot. So you could give it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2189.1s	2189.1	 to a bunch of quote unquote, COVID patients. But if it's not being given to COVID patients, either
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2193.2s	2193.2	 before or right as they're getting sick, maybe it doesn't show the results that you would expect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2198.0s	2198.0	 from a prophylactic treatment, meaning you're getting it before you're really sick. And that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2201.5s	2201.5	 where it may be the most efficacious. And so some people are saying, wait, we don't know enough,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2206.4s	2206.4	 don't do it. It's not worth the risk because of that small percentage high severity problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2210.9s	2210.9	 While others are saying, oh, my gosh, it's totally worth the risk, because the downside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2214.2s	2214.2	 if you get coronavirus can be really bad. And, you know, it's so there's a lot of room for debate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2219.2s	2219.2	 here. And when there's a lot of room for debate, you usually kind of revert to some sort of base
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2223.9s	2223.9	 belief or some base kind of political point of view or something. And I think that's what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2227.4s	2227.4	 gone on here. This isn't a clear cut, the sun is yellow and the sky is blue kind of conversation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2232.5s	2232.5	 This is like, I can interpret this a lot of different ways. It does seem that like, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2238.0s	2238.0	 this drug, you know, like a lot of has an effect in the same way that a lot of other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2242.8s	2242.8	 that this drug might have on a lot of other viruses. And this especially plus zinc, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2247.6s	2247.6	 and this Z pack this is a thromisin, which is an antibiotic together may be really effective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2254.7s	2254.7	 And so yeah, if you weigh the downside and the probability of that downside for a patient
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2258.1s	2258.1	 against what the potential upside would be, depending on the risk factors, now that we know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2261.7s	2261.7	 those better for COVID, you can make an educated decision and maybe it should just be left in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2265.7s	2265.7	 hands of doctors versus like have some national statement about it. I don't know. But yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2271.1s	2271.1	 certainly a lot of room for debate and thus a lot of kind of, you know, political engagement on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2278.2s	2278.2	 Sax, there was a lot of talk about what the Bay Area looks like after this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2282.7s	2282.7	 whether it's commercial real estate with Twitter and Square going full work from home,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2288.2s	2288.2	 and people not wanting to work in cities. What are your general thoughts on what the world looks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2293.0s	2293.0	 like a year from now and maybe five years from now? If there is going to be some permanent change,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2298.4s	2298.4	 what do you think it would be? Well, there could be a big resorting. I mean, it kind of depends
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2304.8s	2304.8	 if the virus becomes endemic. It's just something we kind of end up living with. But, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2313.2s	2313.2	 if it does, I mean, if you're like over 70, are you really going to want to stay in a place like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2317.6s	2317.6	 New York City, or you don't want to go somewhere else? And so I could imagine if this does become
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2322.8s	2322.8	 this long term thing that's just endemic. Yeah, we don't if we don't have a vaccine, I could see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2328.3s	2328.3	 cities resorting where, you know, New York is people who are comfortable with COVID risk. And,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2333.8s	2333.8	 you know, it's I think San Francisco, the big issue with San Francisco is that there are always a bunch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2343.2s	2343.2	 of reasons not to want to live there. I mean, the city that seems like chronically mismanaged.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2348.2s	2348.2	 It's a huge problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2349.4s	2349.4	 Feces, lots of poop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2351.1s	2351.1	 The huge homeless problem, public health issues with that. There's a lot of crime that isn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2357.1s	2357.1	 responded to properly. So there's all these like reasons not to live there. But the reason why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2361.4s	2361.4	 people chose to live there is because the tech industry had a very strong network effect. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2366.0s	2366.0	 you needed to be in Silicon Valley or San Francisco in order to have access to these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2371.6s	2371.6	 jobs and opportunities. And if those jobs opportunities are now available via Zoom,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2376.3s	2376.3	 and you can be doing them from anywhere, are people still going to choose to live in San
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2380.3s	2380.3	 Francisco, you know, with any with the the cost of living and housing and apartments and all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2387.4s	2387.4	 rest of it that that goes that goes along with it. So yeah, I mean, I think there is some chance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2393.0s	2393.0	 that this whole remote work thing could break Silicon Valley's network effect. And that would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2398.9s	2398.9	 be really bad for places like San Francisco, which, you know, otherwise might not be the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2404.4s	2404.4	 greatest places to live. Yeah, my thesis on this in terms of getting out of the recession,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2410.9s	2410.9	 I think remote work could lead to a level of efficiency and profitability in the companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2417.6s	2417.6	 that we have never seen before. If you think just about every manager now knows how to manage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2424.3s	2424.3	 remote workers, right? You learn that in like three, four weeks, you figure out how to manage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2429.1s	2429.1	 people remote, even people who hated managing people remote, all these Gen Xers and boomers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2434.5s	2434.5	 who are managing, you know, millennials and earlier Gen Xers, they now know how to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2440.2s	2440.2	 And what they quickly learn is, these three or four people in my team are crushing it. These two or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2445.4s	2445.4	 three people don't need to be here, they're not actually adding any value. So I think what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2449.8s	2449.8	 going to happen is they're going to cut the bottom people, then they're going to cut their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2454.2s	2454.2	 office space. Now you've removed, I don't know, call it 30% of the cost basis of a business 40%,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2460.4s	2460.4	 and it's operating better and people are happier. And then when you do hire somebody, there's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2465.2s	2465.2	 to be more talent available. And you've just opened it up that you can hire somebody anywhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2469.7s	2469.7	 in the world without an office. And you don't have to relocate them. And you don't have to pay. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2475.9s	2475.9	 don't know what you guys think the average additional cost is to be in San Francisco,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2480.5s	2480.5	 but I'm going to say $30,000. So a $40,000 a year job or $50,000 a year job becomes a 70 or 80,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2486.5s	2486.5	 something like that. And if all that happens, these companies are going to be so profitable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2492.0s	2492.0	 that they're going to start growing. And that leads us out of the economic downturn. Any thoughts on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2497.5s	2497.5	 my thesis? That's not a thesis. That's a hope. Yeah. Hope's not a fucking strategy, Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2505.4s	2505.4	 Well, I just think it's a potential way out. I think it, I mean, what do you think in general
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2510.0s	2510.0	 about this trend of remote then, Jemma? I think it's great. And I think that we're realizing that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2516.0s	2516.0	 you know, there's no monopoly on innovation. And companies can be really productive remotely,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2522.8s	2522.8	 that most of the work in an office is busy work and politics, and you can cut it all out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2528.4s	2528.4	 And you can do the same amount of work in much less time, which gives you more time to frankly

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2539.4s	2539.4	 I just think it's so much better for people to realize like we got to, you know, it's not like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2545.3s	2545.3	 it's not 1820 or 1920, it's 2020. So we're going to live to 100 years old. Like we have a long time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2552.6s	2552.6	 to be in the grind. And so, you know, working and accomplishing what you used to in half the time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2560.1s	2560.1	 and not having to commute and being able to live where you want your people you like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2564.7s	2564.7	 man, that has a huge positive impact to your kids, you, your community. It's just way better. I just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2572.1s	2572.1	 think offices are just complete. Kind of like it's all Shakespearean theater in the end,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2579.8s	2579.8	 and cutting it all out is great. And specifically, San Francisco is just a complete cesspool dump of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2585.3s	2585.3	 shit. And so, you know, being able to just get out of that city. All right, everybody, welcome to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2591.3s	2591.3	 hall. You're listening to the all in five. I read some stats yesterday that were just so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2596.6s	2596.6	 unbelievably shocking, like the number of break ins, the number of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2601.6s	2601.6	 number one in the country, your number one in the country, the amount of disease that like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2607.3s	2607.3	 communicable disease like typhoid. And I'm like typhoid. I was born in a country and scratched
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2614.3s	2614.3	 and clawed to emigrate as a refugee to leave a country that had typhoid as a disease. Welcome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2620.0s	2620.0	 home, Jermoth. Just to end up back in that in San Francisco. Did you bring it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2624.9s	2624.9	 That's a joke. You brought it with you? That's an absolute joke. So yeah, I mean, the idea that I'd
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2630.6s	2630.6	 never have to go to San Francisco ever again is, oh my God, it brings joy to me. It is a it's an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2637.0s	2637.0	 unmitigated disaster. And I think this will be part of the boom bus cycle that, you know, David,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2641.9s	2641.9	 you were part of when you were here at Stanford, you know, getting an office in San Francisco or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2646.0s	2646.0	 having an apartment, it was cheaper, I think, in the city than it was down in Palo Alto,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2649.6s	2649.6	 was it not? Well, back in, yeah, we moved the Yammer to San Francisco, which was 2009. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2656.0s	2656.0	 we were able to get space for $20 a foot per year. Crazy. That's what I paid 2007 2008. I read it. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2664.4s	2664.4	 read it. I read a crazy article. It was about the Kushner's and this building that they own that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2671.9s	2671.9	 Brookfield asset management was going to buy. And, and it said that they bought this building. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2677.7s	2677.7	 so the Kushner's moved to like Park Avenue, the General Motors building overlooking Central Park
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2682.3s	2682.3	 or something, right? It's a beautiful building. And it actually quoted in there the price that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2687.4s	2687.4	 they were paying. And it was incredible because it was like 100 bucks a square foot per year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2692.8s	2692.8	 And I realized, oh my God, they're paying less for Central Park views in New York than I'm paying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2698.4s	2698.4	 for a warehouse in Palo Alto. What the fuck is going on? This makes no sense whatsoever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2704.8s	2704.8	 That'd be supply and demand right there. And I thought to myself, like, this is, this is crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2710.2s	2710.2	 Like California is so expensive. The taxes are so high. It's, I think people will, are going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2716.4s	2716.4	 leave in droves. Honestly. What do we think of Elon selling all his homes and then actually saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2722.7s	2722.7	 he's going to leave and, you know, move Tesla out? I mean, I don't think it's a practical reality to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2729.2s	2729.2	 move Tesla out of, out of California. I think that the incremental facilities can be built
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2734.1s	2734.1	 wherever he wants them to be built based on where he gets the tax incentives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2738.4s	2738.4	 Well, but I think the Tesla Fremont was a really good example of this sort of like culture war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2743.1s	2743.1	 that's going on, this, this political battle over lockdowns. And, you know, you had kind of a mid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2750.0s	2750.0	 level health department, bureaucrat in Fremont padlocking their factory and saying they couldn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2755.2s	2755.2	 go back to work. Whereas if he was in Texas, he could. And then, you know, around the same time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2761.7s	2761.7	 you had this whole like chilly Luther thing in Texas where she was a small business owner,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2767.3s	2767.3	 you know, owns a, like a haircut place. And she was basically going to be put in jail for a week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2773.2s	2773.2	 for giving somebody a haircut. And there was like a, you know, dust up over that. So, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2779.8s	2779.8	 I think that like, you know, the country is certainly ready to get back to work. And,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2785.2s	2785.2	 and if this is the political debate, you know, in November, I'm not sure it will be because six
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2789.6s	2789.6	 months is a really long time from now, but there was a four or five months. But if this is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2795.1s	2795.1	 political debate, I, you know, this, this will be the way that Trump gets reelected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2800.7s	2800.7	 Yep. I think there's going to be some pretty significant benefits because of the reaction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2806.4s	2806.4	 you guys are speaking to. It's not just about people moving, but it's a reaction to regulation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2812.4s	2812.4	 And that could have some pretty profound effects that could benefit certain sectors and businesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2820.5s	2820.5	 and accelerate new outcomes. One of the things that, you know, I have a strong belief in is like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2826.4s	2826.4	 I think in 20 years, we could kind of eradicate all infectious disease. The only thing holding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2831.2s	2831.2	 that up is regulation because the science is known. The engineering is basically there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2836.4s	2836.4	 And it's simply a function of getting these things approved and getting across the finish line,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2840.1s	2840.1	 doing gene editing and humans for genetic mutations that cause harm to humans is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2846.1s	2846.1	 technique that we've known for 20 years. And there was a guy, a patient that died in 1999 from one of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2852.7s	2852.7	 the first AAV treatments, the viral vector gene editing treatments. After that, there was this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2857.6s	2857.6	 clampdown and suddenly everything stopped and there was like no longer any progress in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2862.2s	2862.2	 space. And they're just now starting to come back. And there's a lot of, you know, really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2868.0s	2868.0	 interesting technology that has been kind of hindered. I mean, you know, not being able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2872.7s	2872.7	 put Teslas out, I think is the tip of the iceberg of what people are seeing regulation can do to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2877.5s	2877.5	 businesses. And look, I'm by no stretch, you know, a libertarian party card carrier, but I do think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2885.9s	2885.9	 and I see it in businesses that I'm involved in all the time, that this, you know, incredibly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2890.5s	2890.5	 onerous, like overreaching regulatory burden and bureaucrats really hinder great new things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2897.5s	2897.5	 from happening in the world. And it's just become so friggin apparent how inept the people are that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2902.8s	2902.8	 are making the decisions that are doing this to us are during this crisis. And I think it could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2907.9s	2907.9	 have a profound benefit on kind of deregulation and accelerating the adoption of new tools and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2913.8s	2913.8	 new technology that could really help us all. So I view the positive side of this. It's not just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2919.3s	2919.3	 like everyone's going to leave California, like there's inept bureaucrats and over regulation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2922.7s	2922.7	 everywhere. Let's talk geopolitics for a moment. Chamath, you know, you heard the president call
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2928.4s	2928.4	 it the Wuhan virus. Obviously, there's no doubt that it came from there. There is a debate. Was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2933.6s	2933.6	 this something that was not created in a lab, but that was being studied in a lab and accidentally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2938.5s	2938.5	 got out. And that's how the jump happened. And there's some tension there between China and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2943.1s	2943.1	 U.S. What do you think the global reaction is going to be and the fallout will be for China?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2948.8s	2948.8	 If any, Japan is paying factories, I read, and helping subsidize them to move factories out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2955.3s	2955.3	 China so they can move that dependency. We obviously saw the dependency on PPE and drugs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2960.4s	2960.4	 being made actually in Wuhan in that area and how we don't have a supply chain that we can rely on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2965.7s	2965.7	 for really mission critical stuff. How do we look at this Chinese relationship in the United States
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2971.3s	2971.3	 and global post pandemic? This is the beginning of the modern cold war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2978.0s	2978.0	 And so it's America versus China, except that China is a much more worthy adversary for us than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2988.3s	2988.3	 the USSR was at their peak. And the reason is because China has been making strategic investments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=2996.8s	2996.8	 for the last 30 years. The biggest thing that prevents China from really going guns blazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3003.6s	3003.6	 broadside attack on the U.S. is that the U.S. dollar is still the reserve currency of the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3008.9s	3008.9	 But even there, China is trying to do a digital currency and a stable coin. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3014.4s	3014.4	 these are all these state sponsored initiatives that come from, frankly, just strategic decision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3018.9s	3018.9	 making to try to usurp the United States as the most powerful country in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3024.2s	3024.2	 And so again, it goes back to, is this a political issue or is this an ideological issue or is this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3029.5s	3029.5	 an exceptionalism issue or is this just a practical reality that we do not want another country being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3034.4s	3034.4	 number one? And can we all agree? And if we can all agree, then I don't think they'll win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3040.7s	3040.7	 Where do you sit on it? For you, is it practical? Is it ideological?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3045.2s	3045.2	 Completely practical. I have zero. I've been thinking about this a lot because I have not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3051.2s	3051.2	 done any investments and I just did my first. So it's been three months and it was a credit deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3058.0s	3058.0	 So it's not even equity. And I was reflecting on what am I trying to do because I felt myself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3067.6s	3067.6	 frenetically spending and working too much and looking at all these different opportunities.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3079.7s	3079.7	 not to win some finite game. This is not ending like a basketball game or a soccer match.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3084.0s	3084.0	 This is like, I'm trying to be in this thing for 50 years. So my goal is to survive. And the reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3090.0s	3090.0	 why I say that is my ideology is very fluid. I have to be able to adapt to market conditions

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3112.0s	3112.0	 with China and make sure that they do not usurp America's standing in the world as the most

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3129.3s	3129.3	 extremely dangerous. I have a real issue with this. I don't think you have the right to judge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3133.5s	3133.5	 Just like Californians can't judge Texans and Texans can't judge Floridians.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3138.2s	3138.2	 Oh, no. You're wrong. You absolutely should judge people who are torturing people and not allowing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3147.4s	3147.4	 I think you should judge people. I think that there's a lot of that stuff in America that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3152.8s	3152.8	 stay silent on. No, that's not true. I am absolutely for cannabis. Anybody who's arrested for

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3167.1s	3167.1	 apply it properly. Those are the number one and two things probably in the United States that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3171.4s	3171.4	 go against the human rights, the Declaration of Human Rights. I'm actually very pro
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3176.4s	3176.4	 fixing those things. I was totally against waterboarding and I think that was the worst
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3179.8s	3179.8	 moment in modern American history. I honestly think that China is going to do China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3185.7s	3185.7	 You know, India is going to be India. And instead of getting caught up in our own ideology,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3193.7s	3193.7	 you should change it in your own country and then make sure that the other country doesn't win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3197.7s	3197.7	 Well, and that's my point is, do you believe engagement with China leads them towards democracy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3203.3s	3203.3	 and better human rights conditions for their citizens or not? And I think-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3206.5s	3206.5	 Again, that's the fool's errand. That is an absolute-

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3217.4s	3217.4	 Europeans were genetically bred to be lazy oligarchs. They just needed an excuse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3223.2s	3223.2	 Okay, everybody. I think we just got kicked out of the iTunes store.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3238.8s	3238.8	 a bipartisan issue now. I think both candidates now will be- Well, Trump is going to run blaming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3248.4s	3248.4	 China for what happened. And I don't think Biden's going to be defending China. In fact,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3255.2s	3255.2	 they're going to try and peg him with the whole Beijing Biden label and he's probably going to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3265.2s	3265.2	 us to be dependent on China for our antibiotics, for our medicines, for our PPE, for any of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3274.9s	3274.9	 products that are important for national survival. I think all that stuff is going to come back home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3281.8s	3281.8	 I think trading with them for other things might be toys, apparel, things that just aren't

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3295.2s	3295.2	 it creates interdependence. And I don't think that this country is going to want to be dependent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3300.0s	3300.0	 on China for anything strategic anymore. Two questions for you, David. What is China's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3305.1s	3305.1	 liability, if any, at this point with this pandemic? Obviously, if they withheld information or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3313.6s	3313.6	 silence whistleblowers, that's a whole different level. And then TikTok. Should we allow TikTok in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3319.9s	3319.9	 this country? Should we, if we're not allowed to have Facebook or Twitter in China, take those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3325.8s	3325.8	 questions either way you want. Well, on liability, I mean, I think, yeah, their liability is huge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3335.7s	3335.7	 There's still a bunch of questions we got to answer around where exactly the virus came from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3341.3s	3341.3	 But the really fateful decision that I think China made is when they shut down travel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3348.3s	3348.3	 to Wuhan, to and from Wuhan, with respect to other parts of China, but they let people from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3355.5s	3355.5	 Wuhan just leave to go all over the world. And so they weren't letting people from Wuhan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3364.5s	3364.5	 go to other parts of China, but they were able to come to the US. And so I think they do have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3371.4s	3371.4	 huge liability, but are we going to hold them to it? No. I mean, as a practical matter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3376.0s	3376.0	 you know, we're not going to, you know, it'd be a mistake to try and change the principle of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3382.6s	3382.6	 sovereign immunity in the courts. But I think in terms of popular opinion, they do have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3388.4s	3388.4	 There are other ways to there are other ways to quote unquote, punish them. Like, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3392.2s	3392.2	 and the US is already doing it. So, you know, for example, the US is limiting and constraining
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3396.7s	3396.7	 Huawei's ability to get access to 5G. And so, you know, it really forces China to either buy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3402.6s	3402.6	 European and American equipment, which is essentially to say that, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3406.6s	3406.6	 the five eyes will be able to basically spy into China. Or they have to basically, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3413.4s	3413.4	 storm into Taiwan and take over TSMC. I mean, so there are there are all these other gambits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3419.1s	3419.1	 and strategies that one can take without getting ideology ideologically caught up in, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3423.9s	3423.9	 Chinese human rights, because they're not going to change. Yeah, I mean, look, all wealth comes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3430.3s	3430.3	 from trade, you know, whether it's at the level of individuals or nations, wealth comes from trade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3435.6s	3435.6	 And so it'd be silly for us to say that we're just never going to have trade with China. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3440.4s	3440.4	 I think that, you know, trade also creates interdependence. And so we're not going to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3444.3s	3444.3	 I don't think, continue to engage in to depend on them for things that are vital to our national
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3449.2s	3449.2	 survival. And so, you know, that that's going to be the change. And the other thing is, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3454.1s	3454.1	 we're going to demand that the trade be more reciprocal. Take the TikTok example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3459.4s	3459.4	 Well, you know, what's probably going to happen is that the TikTok will probably be caught up in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3464.2s	3464.2	 some larger negotiation. And, you know, is the quid pro quo will Tesla gets to sell cars in China,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3470.4s	3470.4	 and TikTok gets to operate in the US, maybe. But, you know, I don't think TikTok sort of falls into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3478.7s	3478.7	 the necessary for national survival category. So it really falls into the reciprocity, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3486.3s	3486.3	 principle. And the question, I guess, will be, are we getting enough in return to allow them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3491.0s	3491.0	 to operate here? And I think that's the way that all this commerce is going to start working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3496.0s	3496.0	 And that's the thing, at least we can like confront our hypocrisy. So Jason, I don't disagree with you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3500.5s	3500.5	 about how, you know, gross the human rights record is. I just think it's a joke that we all sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3506.2s	3506.2	 like, cry foul, like it's like the biggest thing in the world when we can't even clean up our own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3510.8s	3510.8	 backyard. And then meanwhile, we continue to trade with them. That's just utterly, utterly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3514.5s	3514.5	 Yeah. So that's why I think we have to continue to work on cleaning our backyard while continuing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3520.3s	3520.3	 to enable the freedom fighters. Meanwhile, win the game against China. And winning the game is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3525.8s	3525.8	 basically pushing for human rights reforms. It's making sure as David said, we have a better trade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3530.6s	3530.6	 balance and make and making sure that like, you know, that the critical parts of the supply chain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3535.1s	3535.1	 and infrastructure that America needs for national security isn't dependent on a third party who have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3539.6s	3539.6	 completely different incentives than we do. Well, and then there's also like soft things like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3543.9s	3543.9	 why is the, you know, why are we taking American movies and changing the ends in order to have them

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3557.2s	3557.2	 getting or whichever, you know, person trading with China is getting, I think it's not worth giving up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3561.9s	3561.9	 what makes America unique and a leader in the world. Freeberg, you have any thoughts on China?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3565.6s	3565.6	 There's about 112 million people in China that work in factories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3570.9s	3570.9	 Factories in China are purpose built. So they're built to make a thing. And then they got to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3575.6s	3575.6	 retooled. If you want to make another thing, you take those two facts. It's very hard to kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3581.7s	3581.7	 replace China as a source of production for a lot of what we consume in this country. That's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3588.2s	3588.2	 reality. So there's two ways you could go. And then there's two kind of necessities. And you end up

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3605.0s	3605.0	 we don't have enough people to work. We don't have the ability to do that. The cost of everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3609.4s	3609.4	 would go up by five X. We could invent new systems of production, which we have the ability to 3d
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3616.2s	3616.2	 printing, bio manufacturing, all these other kinds of really interesting ways of making stuff that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3620.4s	3620.4	 could replace the old factories that are run in China. Similar to kind of what maybe Elon has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3626.3s	3626.3	 tried to do with his automated factory with Tesla. And so through automation, through 3d printing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3631.8s	3631.8	 through bio manufacturing, you can kind of change the methods of doing this stuff. If we could do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3635.7s	3635.7	 that, then we could decouple from China. So the reality is like, I don't know how we continue to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3642.0s	3642.0	 consume things at the, you know, it's a percentage of wallet share that come from China without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3647.4s	3647.4	 rebuilding how you make stuff. No, but that's the whole point. By the way, I think the reason why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3652.4s	3652.4	 that's valuable is that that's the best way for us to actually get back to an inflationary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3656.4s	3656.4	 cycle as well. So I completely agree with you. It is incredibly inefficient. It'll be incredibly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3661.6s	3661.6	 costly. But that's where I think you shift the balance of power so that instead of all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3667.2s	3667.2	 power sitting on the side of capital, you shift it to the side of labor, labor demands for wages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3673.7s	3673.7	 And then all of a sudden, costs go up, input costs go up, prices go up, inflation exists, and that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3679.5s	3679.5	 fixes a lot of our debt problems. It fixes our deflationary supercycle. It fixes a lot of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3684.8s	3684.8	 And so if things got more expensive, it would be good for the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3688.8s	3688.8	 Very good. Yeah, even but even look, even with maximal like look that replace 112 million

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3700.4s	3700.4	 stuff you need to make here. Yeah, I mean, there's other countries too. I mean, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3705.0s	3705.0	 people are moving fact to Japanese are moving factories to Taiwan and Vietnam. Yeah. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3709.9s	3709.9	 But if we create new methods of production, which were uniquely positioned to do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3714.1s	3714.1	 we can completely reinvent the wheel and a lot of industries and actually produce for the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3718.7s	3718.7	 Right now, you know, China exports physical goods, the US exports virtual goods. And if we want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3724.9s	3724.9	 get into the business of making physical goods, we have to just do it 10x better. We have the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3729.1s	3729.1	 ability to do that, we just got to get the fucking will. So if I were to take $3 trillion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3732.8s	3732.8	 of federal money, and you know, treasury bonds, and hope that they don't turn into junk bonds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3737.7s	3737.7	 I would basically turn that money into reinventing the systems of like, how do we make stuff using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3742.6s	3742.6	 these new technologies that the US is uniquely positioned to capitalize on. And you know,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3790.9s	3790.9	 I've been locked down for three months. I'm lost my mind. I mean, this is May 12 for me and I think

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3812.8s	3812.8	 We haven't been tested, but we haven't we don't have any symptoms. I got tested twice,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3824.7s	3824.7	 it didn't do anything to me. Right? Totally. By the way, let me just say one more thing. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3829.4s	3829.4	 a really interesting finding. This paper came out a few days ago. That shows that 40 to 60% of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3836.3s	3836.3	 population that has never been exposed to SARS coronavirus to the current coronavirus already
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3841.6s	3841.6	 have activated T cells to the virus. And the reason is that they've had other coronaviruses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3848.0s	3848.0	 through a common cold and they've developed this immune response. So this may explain why a large
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3852.6s	3852.6	 percentage of people are just so asymptomatic and totally fine. It's a pretty astounding finding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3858.4s	3858.4	 And so you could get checked for those other antibodies or you know, these these activated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3862.7s	3862.7	 T cells and know if you're in a good position to kind of ward off the coronavirus. And that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3867.3s	3867.3	 another thing we should probably do that 60% of people that already have this. By the way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3871.4s	3871.4	 that won't stop the spreading that person will still get infected and spread. But their,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3876.1s	3876.1	 you know, immune response is such that they'll shut the thing down pretty quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3879.8s	3879.8	 So would you call this like some parallel or shadow herd immunity or individual immunity?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3887.0s	3887.0	 It's individual immunity and it's related to just cross reactivity with other coronaviruses. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3892.2s	3892.2	 we've already developed an immune response to other coronaviruses that gives us seemingly a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3896.0s	3896.0	 pretty good response to this coronavirus for, you know, more than half of the population.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3900.7s	3900.7	 On a percentage basis, how how much do we know about this virus? Just as we wrap up here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3907.7s	3907.7	 if you had to state a percentage of like in two years, we're going to know 100% or 90% about the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3913.5s	3913.5	 virus, whatever it is. What do we know now? We know everything about the virus itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3919.4s	3919.4	 We are very like like with any virus, we know very little about how it affects a specific human
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3926.0s	3926.0	 based on their genotype, meaning based on your health and your your genes. Here's what this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3931.3s	3931.3	 virus is going to do to your body. And we're not going to know that in two years. And we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3934.4s	3934.4	 not going to know that we don't know that for most viruses for humans today, the matching of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3938.1s	3938.1	 genotype to genotype of viral. But if we understand X amount about the HIV virus or Ebola, what do we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3947.3s	3947.3	 know now? I mean, maybe Ebola would be the best one. Like we have pretty good knowledge of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3951.5s	3951.5	 after X number of years. What do we know now on a percentage basis of coronaviruses? We had to guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3955.5s	3955.5	 Again, we know everything about the virus itself, like 100%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3958.8s	3958.8	 Okay, about this. Yeah, the human response to the virus and why it's causing these weird symptoms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3963.6s	3963.6	 with different people and so on. Yeah, I'd say we're probably I don't know, 40%, 30%. We've kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_bNAh5G6E&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=141&t=3968.5s	3968.5	 mapped the outcome, but we haven't mapped the progress to the outcome in the human body.
