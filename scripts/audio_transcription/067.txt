https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=31.9s	31.9	 Hellmuth is like one of those truffle dogs in like, you know, Alba in Italy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=36.8s	36.8	 You know, you send them out into the woods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=38.3s	38.3	 He forages around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=39.7s	39.7	 He finds it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=40.4s	40.4	 He finds a truffle, just digs it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=45.3s	45.3	 And then he follows like a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=46.8s	46.8	 He follows tail wagging, tail wagging, waiting for his owner to show up and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=51.9s	51.9	 pick this little billionaire off the ground.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=58.5s	58.5	 Hellmuth is the most insecure person, but he's such a beautiful human being.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=62.7s	62.7	 I mean, it's a great human.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=64.2s	64.2	 It's like, it's like the tale of two people.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=125.1s	125.1	 The Viceroy of vegans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=126.3s	126.3	 It came to me in the shower today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=127.7s	127.7	 I was like, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=128.6s	128.6	 He needs a new one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=129.2s	129.2	 I switched my background, guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=130.4s	130.4	 Do you like it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=131.0s	131.0	 I just flipped the camera to look the other way, just to mix it up a little.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=133.7s	133.7	 Now we can see your chef picking the vegetables in your garden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=136.5s	136.5	 Well, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=137.0s	137.0	 Before you used to see him pick the herbs, he was picking the vegetables.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=140.3s	140.3	 He was picking the vegetables.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=144.3s	144.3	 I used to see him pick the herbs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=146.0s	146.0	 The herbs are on this side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=147.6s	147.6	 Now you can see him pick the veggies.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=160.3s	160.3	 You seem to enjoy the food, Jason, every time you talk all this shit, but you are always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=163.4s	163.4	 eating when you're at my house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=164.7s	164.7	 You're always eating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=165.7s	165.7	 Who's the first RSVP after Phil?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=167.7s	167.7	 He's not just eating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=168.7s	168.7	 He's sending his notes to the kitchen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=170.1s	170.1	 Could you just do this a little differently?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=171.7s	171.7	 I do give notes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=172.7s	172.7	 I do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=174.2s	174.2	 Usually positive ones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=175.2s	175.2	 It's like three out of four positive notes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=178.0s	178.0	 You know when I flew with Chamath a few weeks ago, the chef made gluten-free Nutella crepes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=183.4s	183.4	 with homemade Nutella.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=184.4s	184.4	 I mean, it was like the most extraordinary breakfast experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=187.9s	187.9	 That Nutella has no sugar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=189.2s	189.2	 It's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=190.2s	190.2	 It's basically all protein, fat, and it's sweetened with monkflower sugar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=196.4s	196.4	 So delicious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=197.4s	197.4	 They also kill some albino seals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=200.6s	200.6	 I've not brought a chef on the plane with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=203.8s	203.8	 But I think in fairness, your kitchen's bigger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=204.8s	204.8	 Well, your plane's not that big.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=205.8s	205.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=206.8s	206.8	 I mean, you've got a small plane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=207.8s	207.8	 Mine has a kitchen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=208.8s	208.8	 I have a galleon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=209.8s	209.8	 I mean, I don't know if a Cessna 142 can fit a chef, Sags.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=213.9s	213.9	 I'm feeling plain shamed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=215.7s	215.7	 You are plain shamed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=218.7s	218.7	 I just got to Business Select on Southwest, so I'm feeling pretty good about myself right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=224.5s	224.5	 now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=225.5s	225.5	 All right, everybody, let's get started.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=228.5s	228.5	 Lot of topics people want to talk about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=230.1s	230.1	 Do you want to start with Rogan or the Canadian truckers?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=233.8s	233.8	 I think Rogan probably leads into the truckers, no?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=235.8s	235.8	 It might, in fact, lead into the truckers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=237.8s	237.8	 Okay, so we covered Rogan and Spotify in episode 66 a whole bunch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=241.8s	241.8	 Since that time, a video surfaced on Saturday with Joe Rogan repeatedly saying, well, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=250.8s	250.8	 N-word, and it's pretty rough to watch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=255.8s	255.8	 And he did a mea coppa, an apology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=261.5s	261.5	 Overall, now Spotify has taken down 70 episodes of his podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=265.5s	265.5	 That's out of over a thousand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=267.5s	267.5	 I thought it was like 113.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=269.5s	269.5	 That's what I saw on Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=272.5s	272.5	 There's 113 total.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=273.5s	273.5	 Maybe 70 had the N-word, but 113 total.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=276.5s	276.5	 Oh, okay, yes, you're correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=277.5s	277.5	 I stand corrected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=278.5s	278.5	 110 have been taken down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=279.5s	279.5	 I was texting with Sags.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=280.5s	280.5	 It's like almost 6% of all of his episodes they took down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=284.5s	284.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=285.5s	285.5	 Something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=286.5s	286.5	 Yeah, but not all of them were because of that language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=287.5s	287.5	 No, that's what I'm saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=288.5s	288.5	 But 6% were taken down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=289.7s	289.7	 6% taken down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=290.7s	290.7	 In his apology, he said, obviously, he was wrong to use that word for the decade or so,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=297.3s	297.3	 but he pointed out that he did not use it towards a person as a slur, but was talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=301.9s	301.9	 about it more in studying or discussing the N-word.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=305.9s	305.9	 Use versus mention, is that right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=307.9s	307.9	 Is that the distinction?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=308.9s	308.9	 Yeah, or use versus quoting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=310.5s	310.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=311.5s	311.5	 So he said it was taken out of context, apologized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=314.5s	314.5	 He also made a joke that he immediately said, oh my God, that's pretty racist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=321.1s	321.1	 I shouldn't have told that joke, where he compared going to see Planet of the Apes in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=326.4s	326.4	 an all black theater in Philly saying he was in Africa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=330.2s	330.2	 On Sunday, Daniel Eck sent a memo to Spotify employees claiming he is not the publisher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=335.7s	335.7	 of the Joe Rogan show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=339.4s	339.4	 Something I completely dispute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=340.8s	340.8	 We'll talk about that in a moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=342.9s	342.9	 What's on the latest brouhaha?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=345.5s	345.5	 And do we think that Spotify will be able to handle this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=352.0s	352.0	 What seems to have died down over the last couple of days, and Rogan is now joking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=356.3s	356.3	 it in his comedy engagements at small comedy clubs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=361.4s	361.4	 What do you think, Sax?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=363.2s	363.2	 Is Joe Rogan going to weather the storm?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=364.4s	364.4	 Is Spotify going to stick with him?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=366.0s	366.0	 Well, OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=367.0s	367.0	 So as of the last episode of the All in Pod, they were trying to cancel Rogan for misinformation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=373.1s	373.1	 For the reasons we discussed, that basically failed because so many of the times something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=378.1s	378.1	 starts with misinformation, eventually becomes the truth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=380.8s	380.8	 Rogan seemed like a guy who actually just wants to present both sides, present a balanced viewpoint.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=385.9s	385.9	 In any event, that whole attempt to cancel him based on misinformation was fizzling out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=390.4s	390.4	 Then lo and behold, this 22 second clip comes out and they escalate the charges to racism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=397.6s	397.6	 If you kind of look at who's behind this clip, it's pretty clear that it was a democratic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=404.8s	404.8	 super PAC who put this together and sort of astroturfed it as a viral video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=409.2s	409.2	 This is part of an organized attempt to cancel Rogan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=412.3s	412.3	 Now, as to the merits of the sort of racism accusation against him, I mean, look, let
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=419.6s	419.6	 me say that I don't think anybody, especially a public figure, should be using this kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=424.6s	424.6	 of language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=426.5s	426.5	 You know, in this day and age, even if you're just sort of quoting something or mentioning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=432.8s	432.8	 it, you know, he should have known better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=438.4s	438.4	 However, there are also similar clips that are now circulating of Joe Biden doing the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=443.2s	443.2	 same thing using this type of like incredibly incendiary language and like a brazen almost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=450.4s	450.4	 offhanded way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=451.6s	451.6	 You've got clips of Howard Stern.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=454.0s	454.0	 Wait, you're saying brazen and he said it exactly the same way as Joe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=457.7s	457.7	 I would say maybe in a cavalier way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=459.4s	459.4	 He's he's but let me come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=461.4s	461.4	 So you have you have Biden doing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=463.6s	463.6	 You've got Howard Stern doing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=466.5s	466.5	 So what is the difference?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=468.0s	468.0	 I mean, the reality here is that we used to in our culture have a distinction between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=474.4s	474.4	 the use of this type of language as an epithet, which was never okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=477.9s	477.9	 Or using it, you were referencing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=481.0s	481.0	 You might have been quoting it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=482.0s	482.0	 You might have been quoting a rap song.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=484.5s	484.5	 You might have been quoting a Dave Chappelle routine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=486.7s	486.7	 You might be reading from a book that you might have been telling a story in which somebody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=491.6s	491.6	 else has said it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=492.3s	492.3	 You're merely trying to relay what happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=494.9s	494.9	 The rules today are that's not an excuse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=497.2s	497.2	 You can't say it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=498.2s	498.2	 But the truth is that 10 years ago, 20 years ago, the rules were a little different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=502.8s	502.8	 That's why Biden said it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=505.2s	505.2	 That's why Howard Stern has these episodes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=507.6s	507.6	 And I think it's why Rogan had said it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=510.4s	510.4	 And I think it's a little bit disingenuous for people to now try and apply the new rules
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=516.4s	516.4	 to this old language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=517.6s	517.6	 And they're doing it very selectively because they're not trying to cancel these other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=521.2s	521.2	 people who said these things under the old rules.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=523.5s	523.5	 They're trying to cancel Rogan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=525.0s	525.0	 So I think what you're seeing here is selective cancellation outrage, selective application
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=530.8s	530.8	 of the old rules.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=533.2s	533.2	 Selective application of these new language rules for the purpose of getting Rogan canceled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=539.4s	539.4	 Why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=540.0s	540.0	 For the same reasons we were talking about two weeks ago or last week, which is he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=545.2s	545.2	 an outsider.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=546.0s	546.0	 He's an independent voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=547.6s	547.6	 He bucks the establishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=549.7s	549.7	 He doesn't present the orthodox view on COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=552.8s	552.8	 And that's frankly why they want to cancel him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=555.3s	555.3	 I'm just looking at the Howard Stern quote.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=557.6s	557.6	 So in 1993, Howard Stern dressed in blackface and used the N-word in a skit he did mimicking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=567.1s	567.1	 Ted Danson talking about Whoopi Goldberg something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=571.0s	571.0	 And he said, I'll be the first to admit I won't go back and watch those old shows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=574.2s	574.2	 It's like, who is that guy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=575.5s	575.5	 But that was my shtick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=576.4s	576.4	 It's what I did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=576.9s	576.9	 And I own it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=577.4s	577.4	 I don't think I got embraced by Nazi groups and hate groups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=579.7s	579.7	 They seem to think I was against them too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=582.1s	582.1	 So I think Sax is probably right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=584.4s	584.4	 Howard Stern's a very different character today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=587.2s	587.2	 I think the question of if Howard Stern acted that way today, would cancel culture mob him?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=592.8s	592.8	 The answer is probably yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=595.3s	595.3	 But I think it's because Rogan is out here probably picking a bone with everyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=604.8s	604.8	 There's no alignment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=608.8s	608.8	 There's no tribal behavior with Rogan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=611.8s	611.8	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=613.0s	613.0	 He's been pretty public about being very liberal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=615.0s	615.0	 He's been very public about being conservative in some ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=617.7s	617.7	 And I don't think he kind of aligns himself strongly with anyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=620.8s	620.8	 And so he is a threat to everyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=622.1s	622.1	 He's got a huge following.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=623.3s	623.3	 And he speaks openly and honestly in a way that is threatening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=628.1s	628.1	 Certainly his behavior was inexcusable and has been inexcusable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=631.3s	631.3	 But there are others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=632.0s	632.0	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=632.3s	632.3	 And so it's an important question, which is why him?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=635.5s	635.5	 Why now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=636.2s	636.2	 It's also interesting with that Ted Danson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=638.2s	638.2	 He was dating Whoopi Goldberg at the time, I believe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=642.0s	642.0	 And Ted Danson, there was a roast of Whoopi Goldberg at the Friars Club.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=646.5s	646.5	 Ted Danson dressed in blackface, I think, which Whoopi Goldberg was in on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=652.4s	652.4	 Oh, Ted Danson dressed in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=653.5s	653.5	 Didn't Howard dress?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=654.7s	654.7	 And then Howard did a send up of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=657.2s	657.2	 Anyway, the point is the standard has changed significantly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=661.6s	661.6	 Let's let Chamath chime in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=663.2s	663.2	 My book of the year last year was this book, Wanting, by this author, Luke Burgess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=670.3s	670.3	 He wrote something on Substack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=673.6s	673.6	 I'll send you guys a link.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=674.5s	674.5	 You can put it in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=676.0s	676.0	 But he said the following.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=677.4s	677.4	 He said, as we regress to a superstitious, quasi-pagan world of witch burning,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=684.7s	684.7	 civil discourse will be replaced with superstition and scapegoating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=689.8s	689.8	 And he was talking about Rogan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=691.7s	691.7	 I think that the thing that I was the most proud of in this whole thing was Daniel Ek.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=699.9s	699.9	 I mean, disclosure, he's a friend of mine, so maybe this is biased.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=703.2s	703.2	 However, I think that Spotify had business principles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=709.1s	709.1	 And this was similar to what Brian Armstrong did at Coinbase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=711.7s	711.7	 I think they stuck to those principles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=716.4s	716.4	 They made a well-reasoned decision that they explained to their employees and shareholders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=723.0s	723.0	 And then they did the most important thing that Saks has always been saying around free speech,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=728.7s	728.7	 which is more speech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=731.5s	731.5	 And so what Spotify said when they explained the decision to not de-platform Joe Rogan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=736.9s	736.9	 was that they would take the exact equivalent economic value of what they were paying them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=741.5s	741.5	 him, $100 million, and invest it in historically underrepresented groups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=747.6s	747.6	 to tell their stories, to make their music, et cetera, and so effectively doubling the universe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=754.4s	754.4	 of that kind of content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=755.9s	755.9	 And so I think if people are really willing to listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=760.4s	760.4	 I think what we should take away from this is here's a really clear-eyed example of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=765.3s	765.3	 solution to free speech, which is just to get more of it on your platform,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=770.4s	770.4	 to have the right disclosures and disclaimers, and then for people to go along with their lives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=777.6s	777.6	 so that they can then choose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=779.3s	779.3	 And I think that that was the one positive outcome that I saw from this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=785.6s	785.6	 entire episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=787.0s	787.0	 The rest of it was another attempt at being morally absolutist and scapegoating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=800.8s	800.8	 And then that was before, obviously, the N-word thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=804.7s	804.7	 And then the N-word thing just brought to light that we live in a very different age where the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=809.2s	809.2	 rules have changed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=810.8s	810.8	 And I think the open question is, if you're going to judge people for past behaviors on current
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=816.4s	816.4	 rules, are we allowed to do it selectively, or does it apply to everybody?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=822.5s	822.5	 And I think that this is why I think we saw people like David Simon came out, and David Simon was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=829.1s	829.1	 very basically excoriated Joe Rogan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=834.8s	834.8	 But then David Simon wrote The Wire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=837.3s	837.3	 And if you watch The Wire, which is an incredible piece of television that people point to all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=842.6s	842.6	 time as one of probably the greatest shows on television, every probably 13th or 14th word was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=849.2s	849.2	 the N-word.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=849.7s	849.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=850.2s	850.2	 I have two observations here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=854.5s	854.5	 And then I'll get to you, Sax, I know you have something you want to chime in on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=858.0s	858.0	 I always like to think about intent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=860.1s	860.1	 And then I like to look at the apology and think, is this sincere or not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=864.8s	864.8	 And when you look at the intent, does anybody actually think Joe Rogan is a racist?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=870.4s	870.4	 And I think it's pretty clear he's not from all of the behavior collectively in his life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=875.1s	875.1	 And then you look at the apology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=877.6s	877.6	 I felt it was incredibly sincere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=880.0s	880.0	 And there were many learning moments in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=881.9s	881.9	 And he's a comedian, which is kind of this other space where we we ask comedians to make us laugh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=887.2s	887.2	 and make us feel uncomfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=888.8s	888.8	 And now we're also asking them to live by a standard that changes every year and words come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=894.2s	894.2	 on and off the allowable list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=899.0s	899.0	 Would anybody here, does anybody here actually think or anybody listening to me think Joe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=902.9s	902.9	 Rogan is actually racist?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=903.9s	903.9	 I think the answer is I don't think anybody thinks that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=905.8s	905.8	 And then number two, I felt the apology was incredibly thoughtful and well done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=911.8s	911.8	 Sax, what are your thoughts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=913.0s	913.0	 Yeah, I mean, I agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=914.0s	914.0	 I agree with those things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=916.3s	916.3	 Nobody was accusing Joe Rogan of racism until the cancellation mob started throwing stones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=922.2s	922.2	 And the misinformation stones didn't work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=925.0s	925.0	 So then they escalated to racism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=926.8s	926.8	 I think the generalized thing is just take take the context out of Rogan for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=932.0s	932.0	 I think that the the formula, if I can point to this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=935.9s	935.9	 of cancel culture is now, I think, pretty well understood, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=941.3s	941.3	 if you don't like somebody, you need to throw some ism label on them until that ism label sticks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=949.4s	949.4	 And eventually you will find an ism label.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=952.0s	952.0	 But the the thing that this cancel culture doesn't appreciate is everybody has some ism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=958.1s	958.1	 that that can be attached to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=960.7s	960.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=961.0s	961.0	 Now, some isms are worse than others, obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=963.8s	963.8	 But, you know, we're all infallible, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=967.4s	967.4	 I go back to like, if you want to quote the Bible, right, there's a there's a beautiful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=970.9s	970.9	 passage into the Bible, the Book of John, and the whole thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=975.1s	975.1	 And you guys have heard this quote many times before, but let me just give you the setup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=978.5s	978.5	 So in the law of the land back then, adultery was illegal, but only for the woman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=984.7s	984.7	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=984.9s	984.9	 And so there's a very famous example of a woman who is accused of adultery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=988.6s	988.6	 And, you know, she was about to be stoned to death, which was essentially the punishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=995.7s	995.7	 And Jesus basically draws a line and says, you know, he who is without sin should cast that first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1002.0s	1002.0	 stone. And nobody does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1005.5s	1005.5	 It deescalates that conflict and everybody leaves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1008.5s	1008.5	 Right. And there's a very famous essay that René Girard wrote that basically compared that to a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1014.0s	1014.0	 different example in a more paganist context where people did stone people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1018.5s	1018.5	 The idea of all of this is that there's some amount of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1023.7s	1023.7	 You know, sin that everybody carries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1027.1s	1027.1	 And I think that at some point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1030.5s	1030.5	 Cancel culture will realize that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1033.2s	1033.2	 You have to deescalate and you have to see through some of this noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1036.9s	1036.9	 You have to have some point of moral resolution to really move on because this sort of like fatalistic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1043.6s	1043.6	 judgment doesn't work anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1045.5s	1045.5	 So whoever people wanted to cancel Rogan, they must be very frustrated today because for all intents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1050.3s	1050.3	 and purposes, he got off the hook.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1052.7s	1052.7	 Maybe try again in the future with some other ism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1055.2s	1055.2	 He may just as well get off the hook in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1057.2s	1057.2	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1057.4s	1057.4	 So what is the real solution?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1059.5s	1059.5	 The real solution is to figure out how to deescalate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1061.9s	1061.9	 After you have a conversation about the things that he's doing that really upset you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1066.4s	1066.4	 And that is still not what's happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1068.0s	1068.0	 And a path perhaps to resolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1069.8s	1069.8	 Let's get free burger and then you sex free burger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1072.0s	1072.0	 I'll say two things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1072.8s	1072.8	 One, I think I once sat next to Tony Blair for dinner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1076.4s	1076.4	 You know, he was the prime minister of the UK and he told me it was a really funny conversation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1081.2s	1081.2	 because he was talking about his youth and he's like, if there were iPhones when I was young, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1084.8s	1084.8	 would not have ever been elected to public office.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1087.3s	1087.3	 Like, you know, he was in a rock band.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1090.7s	1090.7	 He was in a rock band.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1092.0s	1092.0	 He I don't know if you guys know his history, but you know, he was pretty freewheeling kind of guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1096.4s	1096.4	 And his point was really broader than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1098.5s	1098.5	 It was that, you know, all of us have something that people can look to us for and use against
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1103.2s	1103.2	 us in some way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1104.3s	1104.3	 But I think what's really important with this Joe Rogan thing, and I think the bigger picture for me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1108.8s	1108.8	 dissenting voices and critical voices and outspoken voices are extremely important in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1114.2s	1114.2	 discourse that makes society progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1116.7s	1116.7	 It is not a good society.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1118.8s	1118.8	 When people that have dissenting voices or offensive voices are shut down, society has a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1124.4s	1124.4	 better opportunity to chart a new course and to identify new paths.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1129.6s	1129.6	 Sometimes when the dissenting voice is wrong and sometimes when it is right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1133.8s	1133.8	 But in both cases, it is important to have that dissenting voice because it allows us to have the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1138.2s	1138.2	 dialogue that allows us collectively to figure out what is wrong and what is right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1142.8s	1142.8	 And so this notion of cancel culture and the way that people like Joe Rogan are and have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1147.9s	1147.9	 attacked for things that they have said in the past or do say today, I think is really contrary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1154.5s	1154.5	 to the opportunity that the United States presents with this, you know, founding principle of freedom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1159.8s	1159.8	 of speech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1160.3s	1160.3	 Sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1161.2s	1161.2	 Yeah, so I agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1162.8s	1162.8	 I want to build on what Chema said with the Rene Girard analysis of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1168.2s	1168.2	 I mean, what we're seeing here is the modern day equivalent of a primitive, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1174.1s	1174.1	 archaic stoning ritual.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1175.6s	1175.6	 This is a modern day virtual stoning in which we're not killing somebody, but we're trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1182.1s	1182.1	 kill their digital avatar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1183.4s	1183.4	 I mean, we're basically trying to remove and destroy their online presence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1187.2s	1187.2	 I mean, that was really the goal here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1189.5s	1189.5	 And the mechanics of this thing, it only works to the extent that people are unaware of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1198.6s	1198.6	 mechanism of the scapegoating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1199.9s	1199.9	 As soon as they become aware that this person's being targeted selectively as a scapegoat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1204.8s	1204.8	 it stops working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1205.9s	1205.9	 And that was the situation we were in last week where you had, you know, Neil Young,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1211.1s	1211.1	 through the first, he cast the first stone, despite being guilty of misinformation many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1216.0s	1216.0	 times himself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1216.7s	1216.7	 He's got like a weird history of saying weird things about GMOs and gay people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1221.2s	1221.2	 And some of the stuff got dredged back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1223.2s	1223.2	 And I think that was fair because let he who is without misinformation cast his first stone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1228.0s	1228.0	 And then he got some of his friends, you know, these aging rockers like Joni Mitchell and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1236.1s	1236.1	 Crosby, Stills and Nash to throw the next stones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1239.6s	1239.6	 And then the media got in on this and CNN and MSNBC, they were throwing stones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1244.8s	1244.8	 And it was all motivated by the fact that Rogan simply does not refuse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1250.1s	1250.1	 He refuses to parrot their orthodoxy because, you know, we can see people like Howard Stern,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1254.9s	1254.9	 who I like Stern, okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1256.4s	1256.4	 But today, Howard Stern has become a full-fledged COVID hysteric.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1260.4s	1260.4	 I mean, he is fully on board with the COVID restrictions and mandates and hysteria.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1265.2s	1265.2	 That's why he gets diplomatic immunity to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1267.8s	1267.8	 So this whole, the whole scapegoating ritual around Rogan was about to fail last week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1273.4s	1273.4	 And that's why they escalated it is because they saw, first of all, Rogan was getting away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1278.5s	1278.5	 And then second, our ability to run these sorts of like witch hunts, if people start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1285.8s	1285.8	 to reject that, we lose all of our power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1288.4s	1288.4	 And so that's why this thing escalated into the most sensitive area that we have in our society,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1293.6s	1293.6	 this language around race, this very hurtful, these hurtful epithets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1298.5s	1298.5	 And these people are playing games with that type of language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1302.9s	1302.9	 And it's very destructive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1307.1s	1307.1	 But I think people are seeing through it, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1309.1s	1309.1	 I really agree with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1310.0s	1310.0	 I think like the scapegoating has a way to resolve things, is losing its effectiveness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1320.0s	1320.0	 increasingly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1320.8s	1320.8	 It did work online for some amount of time early on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1325.4s	1325.4	 And David, you're exactly right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1326.8s	1326.8	 It's when the mechanism of action was poorly understood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1330.6s	1330.6	 But now that everybody sees it and people try to do it all the time, it just stops working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1336.0s	1336.0	 And it's not nearly as effective anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1338.2s	1338.2	 It's a burnt out tactic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1339.4s	1339.4	 You know, we see this in the start-ups and it's like this marketing channel has been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1342.7s	1342.7	 overburnt and everybody knows, like, okay, I'm being marketed to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1345.2s	1345.2	 And to give it some context for those people who are wondering, you heard Rene Girard like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1349.6s	1349.6	 three or four times here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1350.8s	1350.8	 He's a philosopher and he taught at Stanford.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1354.0s	1354.0	 He had a big impact on Peter Thiel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1356.1s	1356.1	 I don't know if Sachs actually took any courses with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1358.4s	1358.4	 And there's a book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1359.3s	1359.3	 Me, Peter, David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1360.6s	1360.6	 I mean, like, if you take courses with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1363.2s	1363.2	 I know you're getting courses, but Peter told me about his ideas in college and I read some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1366.9s	1366.9	 of his books.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1368.2s	1368.2	 His books are incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1369.2s	1369.2	 I mean, he is one of the most powerful thinkers of the show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1374.7s	1374.7	 I mean, he's he passed away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1375.6s	1375.6	 Reminds me of Joseph Campbell, the power of myth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1377.6s	1377.6	 Like they were really thinking about the sort of basic tenants of like human, the human
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1384.0s	1384.0	 condition and how people behave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1385.4s	1385.4	 It's really worth double clicking on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1387.7s	1387.7	 I think also interesting in terms of forgiveness and blackface.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1392.7s	1392.7	 Justin Trudeau has appeared no less than three times in his youth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1397.7s	1397.7	 In blackface.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1398.5s	1398.5	 And it's not a joke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1400.5s	1400.5	 It's literally true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1402.1s	1402.1	 Justin Trudeau, like the reason why the the racism label was planted on Rogan is because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1409.5s	1409.5	 he's heterodox.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1410.5s	1410.5	 The reason why that racism label has not yet really been planted on Justin Trudeau is because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1416.0s	1416.0	 he's orthodox.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1416.8s	1416.8	 He's quite he's quite part of the ingrained establishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1420.3s	1420.3	 He comes from royalty in Canada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1422.2s	1422.2	 Growing up, pure Trudeau, you know, we were we were liberals growing up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1426.0s	1426.0	 We were members of the Liberal Party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1427.4s	1427.4	 We made donations to the Liberal Party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1429.6s	1429.6	 You know, in our lore, there is no greater symbol than pure Trudeau, his father.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1436.2s	1436.2	 And so when you're the son of somebody like that, you get an enormous amount of credit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1441.2s	1441.2	 in your bank account that you're born with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1443.2s	1443.2	 And he was able to burn through so much of it by doing things that anybody else in any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1448.0s	1448.0	 other situation may have been judged much more harshly for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1450.9s	1450.9	 And he wasn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1452.8s	1452.8	 And he becomes prime minister.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1454.0s	1454.0	 And then he's able to get reelected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1456.0s	1456.0	 But, you know, his day of reckoning is reckoning is coming because he is revealing himself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1463.0s	1463.0	 to be a part of this establishment with these views that are actually really uncomfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1468.8s	1468.8	 and, you know, quite grotesque because of how judgmental they are of everybody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1473.5s	1473.5	 And that's a great segue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1475.2s	1475.2	 And then just finally, Sachs, correct me if I'm wrong here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1479.3s	1479.3	 Joe Rogan has voted Democrat his whole life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1482.6s	1482.6	 He holds largely Democratic beliefs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1485.5s	1485.5	 He's for universal health care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1486.9s	1486.9	 He's pro-trans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1487.7s	1487.7	 He's pro-gay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1488.8s	1488.8	 He supported Bernie Sanders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1490.4s	1490.4	 And he was voting for Bernie Sanders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1493.4s	1493.4	 He's a really stupid person for the Democrats, for Democratic politicians like Biden to alienate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1498.8s	1498.8	 because he's a hero to young people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1501.4s	1501.4	 He's a hero to the working class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1503.6s	1503.6	 And his views are fundamentally, I'd say, more progressive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1506.9s	1506.9	 Yeah, they're 100% progressive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1508.5s	1508.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1509.1s	1509.1	 So it's stupid for them to do this, but it's also stupid for them to be alienating these truckers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1513.3s	1513.3	 because Democrats were supposed to be the party of the working class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1515.4s	1515.4	 So let's pivot to that issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1517.2s	1517.2	 Can I just say one last thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1518.3s	1518.3	 I just want to reiterate this, Sachs, because I just want to really give you a chance to say it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1523.2s	1523.2	 You've always said, and it's so true, the solution to free speech and to protect it is more speech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1528.7s	1528.7	 And I just want to say to Daniel Lack and the team at Spotify,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1531.8s	1531.8	 you guys must have been in a really difficult spot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1534.8s	1534.8	 But the decision to take that $100 million to increase the funnel for other voices and historically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1542.5s	1542.5	 underrepresented voices is so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1546.0s	1546.0	 And I hope you guys get to the other side of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1547.7s	1547.7	 But I thought it was a really, really, really good decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1550.3s	1550.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1550.8s	1550.8	 So on Eken, the Spotify decision, let me say I want to think to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1553.6s	1553.6	 So I applaud them for not canceling Rogan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1557.3s	1557.3	 They must have been under enormous pressure to do so, including from their own employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1562.1s	1562.1	 The only thing I didn't like in Eken's statement was when he talked about the user safety and how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1566.8s	1566.8	 they need to do a better job of user safety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1569.6s	1569.6	 That's a concept that doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1572.5s	1572.5	 I mean, Rogan is not sneaking into people's living rooms and turning his show on and pressing play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1578.9s	1578.9	 If people don't like it, I'm talking about users.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1582.0s	1582.0	 If users don't like the content, they don't have to listen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1584.8s	1584.8	 You don't have to click play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1586.1s	1586.1	 He's not literally turning the channel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1587.6s	1587.6	 Safety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1588.4s	1588.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1588.7s	1588.7	 We've still bought into this idea of psychological safety that being confronted with any view you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1594.1s	1594.1	 don't like is a threat to your safety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1596.8s	1596.8	 That is actually a threat to free speech because it's giving the most hysterical people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1600.6s	1600.6	 in our culture, the ones who are most prone to being offended a veto over any idea that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1605.4s	1605.4	 end speech they don't like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1606.7s	1606.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1606.8s	1606.8	 If you're uncomfortable, you're unsafe, you could remove yourself from that situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1611.1s	1611.1	 If it's a piece of media, you don't need to read every book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1613.6s	1613.6	 You don't need to see every Quentin Tarantino film.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1615.3s	1615.3	 You don't need to listen to Joe Rogan or whatever else that you find offensive to you personally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1619.5s	1619.5	 I just don't think we should be feeding that idea that that psychological safety is a legitimate idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1623.9s	1623.9	 We talked about this before with people at work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1627.4s	1627.4	 If they say they feel unsafe, that's instantly like an HR, like, oh my God, you feel unsafe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1632.1s	1632.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1632.4s	1632.4	 Red alert.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1632.9s	1632.9	 HR comes running over because they have a legal requirement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1636.3s	1636.3	 If someone's creating a safety issue in the workplace, they have a legal requirement to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1640.0s	1640.0	 remove that problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1641.1s	1641.1	 That's why this language got started is it triggers the machinery of HR to remove
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1646.7s	1646.7	 people who are doing nothing wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1648.4s	1648.4	 But if I told you as an employee, like, hey, listen, your work product is not good enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1652.9s	1652.9	 You're like, I feel unsafe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1654.5s	1654.5	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1655.0s	1655.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1655.2s	1655.2	 Anyway, let's go to the truckers because I think we're beating this stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1657.7s	1657.7	 I just want to have one final comment on Spotify.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1661.7s	1661.7	 I think Dan, I appreciate what Daniel did with a hundred million dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1665.4s	1665.4	 That's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1667.3s	1667.3	 And I think it's great that he's supporting free speech and he's holding his ground there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1670.7s	1670.7	 I know that's not easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1671.7s	1671.7	 However, I think he's intellectually dishonest saying they're not the publisher of Joe Rogan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1676.1s	1676.1	 I have a three part test to see if you're a publisher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1678.9s	1678.9	 Do you pay for the content?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1679.9s	1679.9	 Do you promote it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1680.5s	1680.5	 Do you produce it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1681.2s	1681.2	 If you do two or more of those, you're de facto a publisher in my mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1685.2s	1685.2	 They pay a lot of money for Joe Rogan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1686.8s	1686.8	 They promote the heck out of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1688.4s	1688.4	 And while they don't produce it in advance by picking the guests,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1692.4s	1692.4	 they do have a production like veto on what content they put out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1698.3s	1698.3	 And so if Netflix has to own the people they pay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1702.3s	1702.3	 even if they don't produce it and they promote,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1704.7s	1704.7	 then Spotify does need to have the same standard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1707.3s	1707.3	 And Disney and Netflix all are producers of content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1710.6s	1710.6	 Nobody would argue that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1711.6s	1711.6	 And I believe Spotify is the producer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1713.5s	1713.5	 Daniel's not being honest on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1716.0s	1716.0	 Let me just defend Spotify for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1718.0s	1718.0	 You guys have been through this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1719.3s	1719.3	 I've been through this many times at several of my companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1721.9s	1721.9	 But when you are in the middle of a firestorm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1725.2s	1725.2	 it's very rare that you can put out these press releases
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1732.4s	1732.4	 where the pride of authorship is one person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1735.3s	1735.3	 And in many ways, you have to write these PR releases
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1739.0s	1739.0	 with all of these guardrails that think about all of these future issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1743.5s	1743.5	 that may prop up over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1745.0s	1745.0	 And so I understand that you guys had some issues with some of the words.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1748.2s	1748.2	 I would just say again, look at the action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1750.9s	1750.9	 And the action is he didn't deplatform someone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1754.0s	1754.0	 and then he doubled down on free speech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1755.9s	1755.9	 and he actually pointed a hundred million dollar fire hose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1758.9s	1758.9	 at people who can now tell their own stories on a platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1763.9s	1763.9	 that is the most important audio platform in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1767.5s	1767.5	 So I would say that's kind of like same thing when I said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1771.8s	1771.8	 I didn't particularly like sometimes Brian's essay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1774.8s	1774.8	 I could have written it better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1776.1s	1776.1	 But at the end of the day, what I saw through it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1777.9s	1777.9	 and I admitted this later,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1779.9s	1779.9	 the substance of what Brian Armstrong did was incredibly profound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1783.2s	1783.2	 One of the most important things that actually happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1785.2s	1785.2	 in the last few years in Silicon Valley culture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1787.7s	1787.7	 And I would just say that I think that Daniel did something really powerful here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1791.1s	1791.1	 And I think that both Spotify and Coinbase deserve,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1793.6s	1793.6	 and the employees and the leaders there deserve a round of applause.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1797.6s	1797.6	 I think it was a very, very hard decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1799.4s	1799.4	 And I think they stuck to their guns,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1801.2s	1801.2	 irrespective of what you believe, they stuck to their guns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1803.6s	1803.6	 The Canadian truckers are protesting, as many of you know, vaccine mandates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1809.2s	1809.2	 Just breaking today, Ontario's premier has declared a state of emergency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1814.4s	1814.4	 for the entire province.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1815.8s	1815.8	 And Ottawa police have braced for thousands of protesters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1820.0s	1820.0	 to descend for the third consecutive weekend USA Today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1823.8s	1823.8	 Also reported the convoy could disrupt the Super Bowl,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1826.3s	1826.3	 Biden's State of the Union, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1827.9s	1827.9	 The protest has been self-titled the Freedom Convoy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1830.7s	1830.7	 and has been underway since January 29th.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1834.8s	1834.8	 It appears it has spanned several thousand vehicles across the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1839.4s	1839.4	 And the truckers are blocking key roadways and bridges,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1842.1s	1842.1	 including the Ambassador Bridge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1844.6s	1844.6	 They're seeking an end to Canada's vaccine mandates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1850.4s	1850.4	 And it feels like this is now morphing into something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1853.7s	1853.7	 a little bit wider than just vaccine mandates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1857.6s	1857.6	 Maybe it's becoming a Occupy Wall Street type of protest open to many people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1863.6s	1863.6	 with many different things that they have grievances about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1868.9s	1868.9	 A reporter from Barry Weiss's Common Sense newsletter slash media operation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1876.0s	1876.0	 wrote what the truckers want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1877.9s	1877.9	 Jason, you just nailed it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1880.2s	1880.2	 I do think that this is actually Occupy Wall Street.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1882.7s	1882.7	 2.0, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1883.7s	1883.7	 Look, it turned out, just to get roots and facts,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1887.8s	1887.8	 so it's not just truckers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1889.5s	1889.5	 This is a broad-based coalition of people across every single race and gender
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1894.0s	1894.0	 and age group in Canada that's participating in this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1897.2s	1897.2	 In fact, the Barry Weiss article, she profiled men, women of all ages,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1901.5s	1901.5	 Sikhs, whites, I mean, everybody, blacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1905.5s	1905.5	 So there's a coalition of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1908.4s	1908.4	 Second is this really isn't about vaccination rates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1911.1s	1911.1	 because it turns out truckers are 90% vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1913.6s	1913.6	 They're vaccinated at a higher percentage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1915.6s	1915.6	 than the actual broad-based population of Canada, which is about 78%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1921.1s	1921.1	 I think the point of this, and again, I care about this so much as a Canadian,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1925.1s	1925.1	 but I just want to read a quote from Justin Trudeau
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1927.8s	1927.8	 because I think it encapsulates what this is really about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1931.0s	1931.0	 The quote is, the small fringe minority of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1935.2s	1935.2	 who are on their way to Ottawa, who are holding unacceptable views
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1940.6s	1940.6	 that they are expressing do not represent the views of Canadians.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1944.4s	1944.4	 And I think it's that phrase, unacceptable views,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1947.6s	1947.6	 that really points to what the real issue here is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1952.8s	1952.8	 which is that there are a lot of people who now say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1955.9s	1955.9	 it's been two years, enough with mask mandates,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1960.0s	1960.0	 enough with all of this, you know, almost police state that's developed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1965.2s	1965.2	 all of the emergency use power that politicians have taken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1969.1s	1969.1	 Let's reclaim our democracy and let's have, you know, freedom again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1973.7s	1973.7	 And under the political viewpoint of the ruling liberal party,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1978.6s	1978.6	 which by the way is now going into revolt as well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1981.3s	1981.3	 a bunch of liberal MPs have just completely flipped because of this statement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1985.9s	1985.9	 It summarizes what Trudeau is saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1987.7s	1987.7	 which is what you believe is unacceptable to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1990.6s	1990.6	 And so now I will quash you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1992.1s	1992.1	 Or that Canada has one viewpoint, Freeberg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1995.0s	1995.0	 Did any of you guys listen to the New York Times Daily podcast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=1998.1s	1998.1	 that our friend sent out the link to this morning?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2000.1s	2000.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2000.4s	2000.4	 You know, to me, these are the same story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2002.4s	2002.4	 It was actually an interview with a reporter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2008.2s	2008.2	 who highlighted some work that she had done and identified that Phil Murphy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2012.6s	2012.6	 the Democratic governor of New Jersey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2015.2s	2015.2	 had done some polling and some focus group discussions with some of his constituents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2022.0s	2022.0	 And the overriding tone was one of emotion, one of feeling left out of the life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2027.0s	2027.0	 that they believe they should have been living over the past two years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2030.3s	2030.3	 And ultimately, I think the tone speaks very clearly to what the truckers are saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2035.2s	2035.2	 which is everyone feels more than ever incredible overreach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2038.7s	2038.7	 into their personal lives by the government and by different governments,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2043.2s	2043.2	 whether it's local or federal here in the US or by this Canadian government or,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2047.8s	2047.8	 you know, go to Australia or the UK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2049.6s	2049.6	 And the sentiment seems to be similar everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2052.0s	2052.0	 I don't think that any time since World War II,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2055.0s	2055.0	 have we seen the government create such restrictions and such mandates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2059.0s	2059.0	 in democratic republics like the United States
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2063.6s	2063.6	 that we just saw over the past two years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2065.7s	2065.7	 And I think the fact that it's continuing when folks are now seeing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2068.9s	2068.9	 you know, on the ground every day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2072.8s	2072.8	 you know, the mildness of Omicron or like, you know, the big challenges
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2076.8s	2076.8	 that their kids are facing in school, and you kind of put these things together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2079.5s	2079.5	 and you say to yourself, why is my government restricting my life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2083.2s	2083.2	 and causing the challenge that I'm being forced to face for what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2087.6s	2087.6	 And I think that's a tone that everyone feels everywhere in the West today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2091.4s	2091.4	 I think in the East, it's a little bit different, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2094.4s	2094.4	 Because of the mindset there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2096.0s	2096.0	 But I think here, it's collectivism, collectivism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2098.4s	2098.4	 And I think here, we pride individual liberty and freedom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2102.8s	2102.8	 as kind of the foundation of these democracies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2105.8s	2105.8	 to have the government tell us what we have to wear,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2108.5s	2108.5	 shots we have to put in our arms, where we can go and when,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2111.6s	2111.6	 how we can behave in ways that were never legislated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2114.8s	2114.8	 in ways that were never kind of debated and discussed publicly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2118.1s	2118.1	 It just feels overreaching at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2119.6s	2119.6	 I think everyone's hit their breaking point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2121.0s	2121.0	 And this is another one of these examples, this trucking thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2123.8s	2123.8	 is another one of these examples of people manifesting their breaking point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2127.1s	2127.1	 And Sachs, to the point we've been discussing over and over again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2130.8s	2130.8	 things have changed radically since the beginning of the pandemic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2132.9s	2132.9	 You believed in mask mandates early because, hey, no downside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2135.8s	2135.8	 We talked about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2136.8s	2136.8	 And we didn't want hospitals to be overrun, which is reasonable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2141.1s	2141.1	 You wanted to have oxygen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2142.1s	2142.1	 We were all trying to make plans for, hey, how bad is this going to be?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2146.0s	2146.0	 But we're sitting here two years later and it's pretty clear Omicron,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2148.7s	2148.7	 which I had, thank you Sachs, is a nothing burger as we said here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2153.5s	2153.5	 Thanks, Sachs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2154.2s	2154.2	 Thanks, Omicron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2155.2s	2155.2	 Sachs-O-Cron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2156.0s	2156.0	 I helped you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2157.5s	2157.5	 Made me a superhero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2158.5s	2158.5	 Thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2158.8s	2158.8	 All I've ever gotten is sick when I've been around you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2160.9s	2160.9	 Yeah, I went to Sachs' party and all I got was an $8,000 gift bag and Omicron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2166.0s	2166.0	 The gift bag's pretty great at Sachs' party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2168.3s	2168.3	 I think getting Omicron helped you because it enabled you to see that this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2172.2s	2172.2	 for you, was largely a nothing burger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2174.0s	2174.0	 And so you could come out of your house and start acting normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2175.8s	2175.8	 I think there's a lot of people all over the country who are like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2177.5s	2177.5	 You were saying that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2178.4s	2178.4	 You haven't left your house for two years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2180.4s	2180.4	 Do you remember the photos of Sachs at the beginning of COVID
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2182.9s	2182.9	 when he was wearing the triple mask and the goggles?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2185.2s	2185.2	 He was scared to death.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2186.3s	2186.3	 He went to Mexico and built a fort.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2189.2s	2189.2	 He Colonel Kurtz did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2190.3s	2190.3	 Well, look, I supported mask mandates at the beginning of the pandemic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2193.6s	2193.6	 when Fauci was telling us masks didn't work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2195.9s	2195.9	 Let's not forget that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2197.8s	2197.8	 I was supporting when the health officials told us they didn't work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2200.5s	2200.5	 Why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2200.8s	2200.8	 Because it was the only thing we had.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2202.0s	2202.0	 We didn't have vaccines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2203.0s	2203.0	 David, come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2204.0s	2204.0	 He was doing us a favor by lying to us, by his own admission.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2208.4s	2208.4	 He said, I lied to you so that we could preserve these masks for frontline workers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2212.7s	2212.7	 Well, thank you, Anthony Fauci.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2214.7s	2214.7	 One of many, one of many noble lies that he's been telling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2218.3s	2218.3	 Here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2219.2s	2219.2	 He's a noble liar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2220.4s	2220.4	 He's a noble liar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2221.2s	2221.2	 By May of 2020, I would say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2223.2s	2223.2	 My biggest political loser pick from 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2226.8s	2226.8	 Take it easy on your picks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2228.1s	2228.1	 I know you want to do your victory lap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2229.6s	2229.6	 It's only February.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2230.5s	2230.5	 Give us till like June for the check-in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2232.8s	2232.8	 Okay, Colonel Kurtz, continue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2234.0s	2234.0	 Masks were the main alternative to lockdowns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2236.4s	2236.4	 That's the way I saw it in the summer of 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2238.8s	2238.8	 And I was saying, end these crazy lockdowns, just do masks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2241.9s	2241.9	 And then once we had the vaccine and all COVID restrictions, that was a year ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2246.2s	2246.2	 And now we still have these restrictions a year later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2249.7s	2249.7	 And that is what the truckers were rebelling against.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2251.8s	2251.8	 Just like you said, these are ordinary people who are sick and tired of having to show their papers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2257.4s	2257.4	 and have to deal with these mandates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2260.5s	2260.5	 And, and for that, they've been like absolutely demonized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2263.7s	2263.7	 I mean, Trudeau comes out and says that they're basically white supremacists and racist and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2268.0s	2268.0	 homophobic, every epithet he can throw at them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2270.5s	2270.5	 Sorry, to your point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2271.2s	2271.2	 He used every, he did use every ism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2273.0s	2273.0	 He really did try to cancel them at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2274.9s	2274.9	 And this is what's really painted him in a corner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2277.2s	2277.2	 He went on national TV and he said, these people are racists and misogynists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2280.8s	2280.8	 That's, that's specifically what he said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2283.5s	2283.5	 And it actually turned out that the overwhelming majority of them were not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2287.6s	2287.6	 They were just normal, ordinary, law-abiding Canadians who were just fed up with the overreach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2292.2s	2292.2	 And then, then what happened was the polling said you should bring these convoy leaders in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2298.1s	2298.1	 sit them down and talk to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2299.9s	2299.9	 And then the political calculus though was impossible for him because he had already
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2304.4s	2304.4	 called them racist and misogynist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2306.0s	2306.0	 So then how could he bring them in?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2307.6s	2307.6	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2307.8s	2307.8	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2308.7s	2308.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2308.8s	2308.8	 How do you negotiate with Nazis basically?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2310.8s	2310.8	 So then what he did was he ran out of Ottawa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2312.7s	2312.7	 So instead of staying in Ottawa, now he's under, in a secure location for his sake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2317.4s	2317.4	 Oh my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2318.0s	2318.0	 Oh, he feels unsafe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2319.6s	2319.6	 So trigger warning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2320.7s	2320.7	 In fairness, when you bring 8,000 people together and you get a wide enough group of people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2325.3s	2325.3	 there was swath stickers and white Confederate flags that were flown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2330.1s	2330.1	 So it might've been two of 8,000, but that did happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2333.6s	2333.6	 Within any protest movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2335.6s	2335.6	 Which I just said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2336.4s	2336.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2337.1s	2337.1	 Within any protest movement, there's always going to be a handful of people who go too far
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2340.8s	2340.8	 and are too extreme, but they did not represent the vast, vast majority of the people who turned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2346.8s	2346.8	 out, which are ordinary citizens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2348.3s	2348.3	 And Trudeau seized on a handful of isolated examples to try and demonize these guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2354.2s	2354.2	 And I think it's blowing up in his face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2356.4s	2356.4	 The fact of the matter is the truckers did not start this fight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2359.6s	2359.6	 It's the zealotry of our elites, of our professional class that started this fight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2364.5s	2364.5	 They will not give up on these mandates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2366.7s	2366.7	 That's the fundamental problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2368.0s	2368.0	 Well, and while they go to the Superbowl with no mask on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2370.4s	2370.4	 I think what you're seeing here with this trucker thing, I think it's going to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2373.0s	2373.0	 huge ripple effects because it's showing the schism in the democratic party between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2377.5s	2377.5	 the professional elites and the working class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2380.2s	2380.2	 Here you have the working class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2382.3s	2382.3	 Remember, these were the essential workers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2384.1s	2384.1	 These are the people bringing us our food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2386.3s	2386.3	 Most of them have already had COVID over the last couple of years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2388.9s	2388.9	 They couldn't sit behind a computer and do their job in their pajamas on Zoom all day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2395.6s	2395.6	 These guys know the reality of COVID, just like you learned the reality, Jason, when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2399.3s	2399.3	 you actually got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2400.4s	2400.4	 And yet we've got this neurotic class of professionals within the democratic party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2405.8s	2405.8	 who are these COVID dead-enders, don't want to give this stuff up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2409.6s	2409.6	 That's the fundamental divide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2411.1s	2411.1	 I think Biden's going to have to choose which side are you on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2413.6s	2413.6	 Are you on the side of the working class or the professional class?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2416.1s	2416.1	 Trudeau has chosen his side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2417.8s	2417.8	 He is the effete elite face of these COVID dead-enders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2423.6s	2423.6	 And Biden's going to have to choose who he supports.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2425.4s	2425.4	 And then those are dwindling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2426.8s	2426.8	 You have governors now who are democratic governors in many states who are saying, listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2432.4s	2432.4	 Omicron is obviously different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2434.5s	2434.5	 And look at the charts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2435.6s	2435.6	 Look at the data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2437.2s	2437.2	 We have to talk about this New York Times story on how New Jersey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2441.2s	2441.2	 and several other of these blue states dropped the mask mandate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2443.6s	2443.6	 So it was absolutely extraordinary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2445.1s	2445.1	 I mean, it's not extraordinary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2446.4s	2446.4	 The risk assessment is different, David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2447.9s	2447.9	 What was extraordinary about it is that...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2450.5s	2450.5	 I mean, I think it's kind of obvious more than extraordinary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2453.5s	2453.5	 If Omicron is less deadly, it's an upper respiratory, doesn't kill people who are vaccinated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2457.9s	2457.9	 and most people are vaccinated, pretty obviously it's time to pivot and open everything up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2461.6s	2461.6	 It's time to make an obvious decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2463.2s	2463.2	 Biden really missed his moment here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2464.6s	2464.6	 So I think, you know, like Freebrick said, it was Phil Murphy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2467.4s	2467.4	 He's the democratic governor of New Jersey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2468.8s	2468.8	 He was supposed to have an easy re-elect, win by 20 to 30 points.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2472.4s	2472.4	 He narrowly squeaks by, by two or three points.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2475.2s	2475.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2475.8s	2475.8	 So then he conducts the focus groups to find out what did we miss?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2478.6s	2478.6	 Why were we so off on this thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2480.4s	2480.4	 And they find out that people are sick and tired of these mandates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2483.2s	2483.2	 He goes to the White House, okay, and shows these findings and says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2486.6s	2486.6	 guys, we have to get off this losing position on COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2490.4s	2490.4	 And the White House sits on his hands and does absolutely nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2493.5s	2493.5	 So Murphy is like, we can't wait anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2495.7s	2495.7	 So he unilaterally goes without White House support.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2498.3s	2498.3	 This is all in the New York Times article.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2500.0s	2500.0	 This is not like some right-wing publication saying this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2502.6s	2502.6	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2503.2s	2503.2	 So he unilaterally says, okay, we're getting rid of the mask mandate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2507.2s	2507.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2507.5s	2507.5	 And then five other states do the same thing because they realize we can't wait anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2511.3s	2511.3	 And Biden is just nowhere to be found.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2513.6s	2513.6	 And Pasaki is saying, well, we're deferring to the CDC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2516.5s	2516.5	 They're deferring to, you know, Rachel Walensky at the CDC and Randy Weingartner at the teachers' unions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2522.4s	2522.4	 And these health officials like Barbara Ferrer in LA County,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2525.5s	2525.5	 all of whom are saying we cannot lift these mandates yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2528.9s	2528.9	 They don't want it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2529.5s	2529.5	 So they are completely on the wrong side of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2531.3s	2531.3	 And then Biden really steps in it by saying to Trudeau in Canada,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2536.8s	2536.8	 listen, you guys got to clear this bridge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2538.3s	2538.3	 Do whatever you need to do to clear this bridge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2541.2s	2541.2	 Basically implying that the civil disobedience needs to be met by force.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2545.6s	2545.6	 And then you've got Harvard professors and CNN analysts saying, slash their tires,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2550.0s	2550.0	 take away their trucking licenses, starve them out, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2553.4s	2553.4	 So this has been the response.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2554.6s	2554.6	 And the response to that is now there's a trucker convoy getting started in the US
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2559.1s	2559.1	 and they're going to march on Washington.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2560.5s	2560.5	 They're going to drive to Washington.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2562.2s	2562.2	 Great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2562.6s	2562.6	 And between now and then, Biden better figure out what side he's going to be on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2566.6s	2566.6	 because if he doesn't handle this right, I think it's going to be the end of his presidency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2570.0s	2570.0	 Peaceful civil disobedience is fine as long as they're not blocking ambulances,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2573.3s	2573.3	 getting people to and from hospitals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2575.1s	2575.1	 That's fine, especially the unvaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2576.9s	2576.9	 Joe Biden, is this Scranton Joe, the guy who said he would take us back to normalcy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2583.6s	2583.6	 the representative of the working class, is that who the president of the United States is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2588.0s	2588.0	 or is he in the Trudeau camp, the Fauci and the Walensky and the Barber Ferreres?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2594.4s	2594.4	 Or is he out of it and easily influenced?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2596.1s	2596.1	 You're asking a rhetorical question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2597.9s	2597.9	 I think that the polling data makes the answer pretty clear, which is that the Democratic Party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2605.2s	2605.2	 is lurching towards establishment insiders and working normal ordinary people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2612.6s	2612.6	 have in larger and larger numbers started gravitating towards to the Republican Party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2620.0s	2620.0	 Minorities in far larger numbers than we ever expected have started lurching towards the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2625.8s	2625.8	 Republican Party. And so the answer is sort of in the polling data and what the actual facts on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2632.5s	2632.5	 ground have been. I mean, we forget because we were all so ready to cast away our Trump derangement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2641.3s	2641.3	 syndrome, but he did get, I think, what was it, nine million more people to vote for him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2645.6s	2645.6	 in this past election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2646.6s	2646.6	 Yeah, the working class, whether there is the white working class or the non-white working class,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2651.6s	2651.6	 are moving in huge numbers. I think the margin of non-white working class who moved to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2657.2s	2657.2	 Republicans last election was 18 points. They got 18 points more share than eight years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2663.0s	2663.0	 So the working class, regardless of their race, is moving towards the Republicans while the Democrats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2668.8s	2668.8	 are becoming this more a feet elite professional class party, this woke elite party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2674.2s	2674.2	 And, you know, I think Biden sort of is caught in the middle of this. And I think he's running out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2679.6s	2679.6	 of time to try and reestablish that he's going to have a centrist presidency that is not completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2686.4s	2686.4	 cowtow and defer to the left of his party to the sort of woke elite thinking. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2691.1s	2691.1	 you see Democratic political scientists like Roy Tusharra writing about this like every week saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2696.1s	2696.1	 this is your last chance. This is your moment to save your presidency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2699.3s	2699.3	 And I don't know if he's listening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2700.8s	2700.8	 Okay, Friedberg, we made some great progress in science this week in nuclear fusion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2706.6s	2706.6	 Do you want to tee this up for us?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2708.1s	2708.1	 I'm happy to. So let me just give a little background for maybe a minute on fusion. So,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2714.6s	2714.6	 you know, the way energy is made in the sun and in all stars is through this process of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2720.4s	2720.4	 nuclear fusion where hydrogen nuclei, the protons inside of hydrogen atoms shoot around,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2726.6s	2726.6	 it's such a high energy and they're so dense because of the amount of hydrogen it all causes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2730.6s	2730.6	 gravity to pull them all together, they get really dense, they start slamming into each other,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2734.6s	2734.6	 when they slam into each other, they fuse into helium and ultimately the heavier elements
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2738.4s	2738.4	 and release energy in the process. And that is what fusion is. So, you know, we talk about nuclear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2743.2s	2743.2	 energy on earth, all nuclear energy that we generated on earth, as a species to date has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2748.1s	2748.1	 been through fission where we take much heavier elements like plutonium and uranium and they break
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2752.9s	2752.9	 apart by squeezing them together and they release energy. But this creates radioactive material,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2757.3s	2757.3	 it's dangerous, it's very, very expensive and so on. So there's always been a question since
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2762.1s	2762.1	 roughly the 1950s on whether or not we could recreate the conditions of the sun or stars on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2767.8s	2767.8	 planet earth by creating a plasma by creating the same sort of plasma that exists inside of stars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2772.8s	2772.8	 very hot, very fast, very dense hydrogen that can slam into itself and slam into atoms and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2780.4s	2780.4	 fuse into helium and release energy. Does that same plasma exist on Uranus?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2788.0s	2788.0	 God, you're gonna give him a wedgie, let science boy finish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2791.6s	2791.6	 Oh, sorry, back to you. Never gets old. Was it 69 megajoules or 420 megajoules?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2798.2s	2798.2	 Yeah, so plasma fusion has always been this kind of holy grail of energy because if you can actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2802.4s	2802.4	 generate plasma fusion, the amount of energy it takes to create the plasma is less than the energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2807.3s	2807.3	 that comes out of the plasma. So it's effectively infinite, free, cheap plasma. And so the system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2814.1s	2814.1	 that people have been building for the last 25, 30 years is these donut shaped systems called
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2819.9s	2819.9	 Tokamaks. They're like a circle or like a donut and they spin the plasma around inside and so it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2825.0s	2825.0	 takes a lot of energy and magnets and so on to try and make this work. You know, there's a company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2828.9s	2828.9	 we talked about a few months ago called Commonwealth Fusion Systems, which uses a new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2832.9s	2832.9	 superconducting material to control that plasma and use instead of using expensive magnets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2837.6s	2837.6	 may just raise $1.8 billion. And, you know, more recently, the joint European Taurus, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2846.0s	2846.0	 managed by the Atomic Energy Authority in the United Kingdom, just this week demonstrated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2852.5s	2852.5	 energy output from their Tokamak plasma fusion system where they generated, you know, 59 megawatts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2859.3s	2859.3	 of energy in five seconds, which is a record. The prior record was set in 1997 by that same agency,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2866.6s	2866.6	 they generated 16 megawatts of power output. So it was a great breakthrough. And, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2871.6s	2871.6	 to make this all possible has required technical breakthroughs in electronics, technical breakthroughs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2878.8s	2878.8	 and sensors and computing and hardware and material science and superconductors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2883.1s	2883.1	 And so all of this is starting to coalesce that plasma fusion might actually become a reality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2888.1s	2888.1	 And the ITAR system, which is the biggest construction project in Europe, 35 nations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2892.9s	2892.9	 have contributed a total of roughly $50 to $60 billion to make this system. It's going to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2898.8s	2898.8	 online around 2027. They've been building it for 20 years. It's going to be a 500 megawatt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2903.7s	2903.7	 demonstration system. And if it works, then it opens up the door that in the future, we may
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2908.4s	2908.4	 actually be able to turn plasma fusion into an energy source for all of humanity. It basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2913.7s	2913.7	 would use water. Plasma fusion is made from taking hydrogen, which you would get from water,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2918.0s	2918.0	 spinning it around, heating it up, getting it to be really, really dense, and ultimately driving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2922.3s	2922.3	 power out of it. The implications are extraordinary, right? So over the next few decades, it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2927.7s	2927.7	 appearing more likely that we will have plasma fusion systems working on Earth. And as that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2932.2s	2932.2	 happens, energy becomes free and it becomes unlimited. And with unlimited free energy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2937.6s	2937.6	 we can terraform Earth, right? We can take ocean water, desal it, turn it into fresh water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2943.0s	2943.0	 We can pump that into deserts, turn them into rainforests. The total annual production of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2948.7s	2948.7	 energy on Earth today is about 170 terawatt hours. That amount of energy could be generated from just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2954.0s	2954.0	 a 10-foot by 10-foot by 10-foot cube of water. That's the amount of material that would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2959.8s	2959.8	 turned into photons that would drive all of the electricity we need on Earth. So it's an incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2964.0s	2964.0	 technology and an incredible breakthrough. We're starting to see this stuff happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2967.6s	2967.6	 One area that I wanted to just highlight, which no one talks about, but which I think is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2972.0s	2972.0	 extraordinarily important about 100 years from now, let's say, as these plasma fusion systems work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2979.6s	2979.6	 it's certainly going to be true that we'll have abundant free energy during the back half of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2984.2s	2984.2	 century. And that'll change everything. We'll decarbonize the atmosphere. We'll terraform the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2988.1s	2988.1	 planet. We can make whatever we want. We can build things, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2992.7s	2992.7	 But the same system of plasma fusion theoretically could be used to fuse heavier elements than just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=2998.8s	2998.8	 helium. So fast forward 100 or 200 years, if we can actually make plasma fusion systems work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3006.0s	3006.0	 to make helium, to make energy, we could also use them to make heavier elements,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3010.1s	3010.1	 like the rare Earth metals that we talk about being so important here on Earth to make batteries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3014.8s	3014.8	 or phosphorus, which we're going to run out of on planet Earth in about 100 years, which is a critical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3020.5s	3020.5	 component of agriculture and feeding ourselves. So over the next, call it 100 years, plasma fusion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3026.5s	3026.5	 systems, I think, back half of this century come online, provide us with abundant free energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3030.8s	3030.8	 And then in the 22nd century, I think this idea of nucleosynthesis, the idea that we can actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3034.9s	3034.9	 make the rare Earth or the heavier elements that are limited natural resources here on Earth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3041.5s	3041.5	 where we could turn water into gold or water into lithium or water into molybdenum or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3046.3s	3046.3	 into virilium or whatever, starts to become a reality. And so this to me, I feel like we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3052.0s	3052.0	 on the eve of plasma fusion being a reality based on some of the results we're seeing. And it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3056.2s	3056.2	 one after the other. ITER is going to come online. The Commonwealth fusion had their materials
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3061.0s	3061.0	 breakthrough and on and on and on. So this seems to be building up. And so the 2030s-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3064.8s	3064.8	 And it's going to hit a tipping point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3066.1s	3066.1	 That's right. I think the 2030s and the 2040s are where this becomes real. And all these problems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3071.4s	3071.4	 and concerns we have about climate change, and carbon in the atmosphere, all of this stuff can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3076.2s	3076.2	 be reversed with infinite energy. And so I'm optimistic, and I'm excited about a lot of what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3081.3s	3081.3	 we're seeing. Let me ask you one question. Obviously, when people start hearing about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3085.6s	3085.6	 nuclear reactors and fission, and then they start learning about fusion, they immediately have the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3090.5s	3090.5	 Chernobles of the world and Fukushima has come to mind and nuclear bombs. In this case, when this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3096.7s	3096.7	 reaction occurs, my understanding, I've interviewed a couple people working on these reactors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3101.0s	3101.0	 is that the reaction just fizzles out, it just stops. And then-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3105.2s	3105.2	 It's not radioactive. So these are not radioactive materials that naturally decay into radioactive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3111.9s	3111.9	 ions or particles that can damage the body or damage. These are literally just hydrogen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3118.0s	3118.0	 atoms that are spun around so hot and smashed into each other. So if the machine breaks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3122.2s	3122.2	 everything just turns off. That's it. And the output, even when it's working, my understanding is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3127.2s	3127.2	 some natural, like just air and water. So there's no output. There's no-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3132.4s	3132.4	 There's nothing radioactive. There's no environmental-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3134.3s	3134.3	 There's nothing to deal with. So let me fast forward 200 years. So now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3137.9s	3137.9	 assume these systems work. As you guys know, all technology over time gets better, faster,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3144.4s	3144.4	 cheaper, smaller. So in 200 years, we could find that we have plasma fusion reactions in every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3150.5s	3150.5	 pocket, in every computer, in every phone. Imagine a world where we no longer need batteries, where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3155.4s	3155.4	 we no longer need transmission lines, and where a system can literally pull hydrogen out of the air,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3160.9s	3160.9	 generate electricity on the fly. And it sounds crazy, but people would have never thought that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3166.1s	3166.1	 the batteries that we put inside of phones would have existed when the first flow cell, battery
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3169.8s	3169.8	 cell was made, whatever, during the early days of chemistry, electrical chemistry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3175.5s	3175.5	 So the idea that we've been able to shrink batteries as we have, the idea that we've been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3180.0s	3180.0	 able to make generators like we have today, these were concepts that would have been so foreign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3183.7s	3183.7	 So I do think that in 200 years, if plasma fusion systems work, there's nothing about the laws of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3187.7s	3187.7	 physics that says they're limited in scale to only being large. They theoretically could be reduced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3192.5s	3192.5	 down. There's no limit to the size they could drop down to. And so there could be a world 200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3197.5s	3197.5	 years from now where plasma fusion reactors exist in every component that needs electricity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3203.3s	3203.3	 And so ultimately, you could see putting these systems on spaceships, and using them to convert
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3209.5s	3209.5	 elements from one form to another. And we could live for, you know, 100,000 years on a spaceship,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3214.7s	3214.7	 and just recycle the elements on that spaceship to produce all our food and our air and everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3219.2s	3219.2	 And yeah, for sure, we could get to Uranus with that. Absolutely. The summary and back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3225.7s	3225.7	 you could circle as anus. So that was my diatribe on plasma fusion. I'm super excited about some of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3230.4s	3230.4	 the progress. Right now, Sax is wondering how we wet our beaks. Just tell us where to place the bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3234.8s	3234.8	 There's nowhere yet. This is I mean, honestly, I don't place bets on things that take 100,000 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3240.7s	3240.7	 It's only 100 years. 100 years. Sorry. 100,000 things that might materialize in four years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3245.9s	3245.9	 Sorry, 100 weeks. He needs to upgrade. Bills are due next month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3248.8s	3248.8	 I got bills to pay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3253.6s	3253.6	 I got bills. He's got bills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3255.9s	3255.9	 A big part of the, you know, just speaking markets for a second, I mentioned to you guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3260.8s	3260.8	 at the end of last year that I made a bet on energy stocks. And the reason I made a bet on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3264.4s	3264.4	 energy stocks is because some of the breakthroughs that we're seeing in decarbonization and renewable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3268.6s	3268.6	 energy has driven a reduction in capital improvements across energy infrastructure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3274.0s	3274.0	 Because people are so optimistic about what's over the horizon, and they're so pessimistic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3278.7s	3278.7	 about carbon-intensive energy systems that we actually have under-invested over the past few
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3283.7s	3283.7	 years in energy infrastructure that it's turning out today is critically needed. So while this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3288.8s	3288.8	 a great long-term kind of optimistic world scenario, and it's going to decarbonize energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3293.7s	3293.7	 production and energy systems, in the near term, we're actually struggling a bit to meet our energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3298.7s	3298.7	 demands. And there's a lot of leverage that energy producers have over those that are the consumers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3302.9s	3302.9	 as we're seeing currently with the Russia, Ukraine, Europe crisis, and so on. And so part of the reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3308.0s	3308.0	 for the climb in energy stocks over the last couple of weeks has been largely driven by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3312.5s	3312.5	 fact that we're realizing that this under-investment in capex has created a decline in productivity of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3316.8s	3316.8	 these assets relative to the demand. And so suddenly everyone's like, oh my gosh, these things are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3320.8s	3320.8	 going to be able to charge more commodity prices are going up, and so on. So, you know, it's very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3325.8s	3325.8	 hard to think about playing an investment cycle around this stuff, because in the near term,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3329.1s	3329.1	 there's still significant demand, and we only have carbon-intensive systems to produce energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3334.7s	3334.7	 Well, I was going to ask you, Trimav, if does this mean on an investment thesis,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3338.0s	3338.0	 you might see a massive spike in carbon-based fuel systems and the sovereign wealth funds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3343.3s	3343.3	 and then a dramatic drop off? No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3345.5s	3345.5	 Okay. What do you predict will happen? Nobody will support anybody investing in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3350.0s	3350.0	 pulling more oil out of the ground. They'll support trying to get more from what we have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3357.7s	3357.7	 But, you know, I don't know if you guys saw, but, you know, there's no support for this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3363.7s	3363.7	 whether you're an investor and you go activist on some of these oil companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3369.2s	3369.2	 you know, whether you're, I think Biden had a big setback because, you know, he had cleared a whole,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3374.8s	3374.8	 like millions of acres of offshore land for some kind of energy extraction that was then just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3382.7s	3382.7	 reversed by the courts. Nobody has support for this stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3386.0s	3386.0	 But what you're saying is exactly right, and it's exactly the reason oil prices are climbing. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3390.7s	3390.7	 just sent you guys a link to what's going on today. But they're climbing for the wrong reason. So,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3395.0s	3395.0	 look, let's just be realistic here. We, you know, we have a cartel, it's called OPEC,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3401.4s	3401.4	 you know, and what they do is they decide output. And we have some checks and balances to OPEC,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3408.0s	3408.0	 namely Russia and a few other actors, who will try to then regulate supply and demand so that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3414.6s	3414.6	 there's mutually assured destruction. The net result of all of that right now is that we do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3419.5s	3419.5	 have some constraint supply for the amount that we need to get to get back to the level of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3423.8s	3423.8	 production we had pre pandemic. So we are going to have some sustained energy prices. But you saw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3428.5s	3428.5	 something really important this past week. Everybody was waiting for this big CPI print,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3432.9s	3432.9	 right? The consumer price index print. Everybody thought it was going to be a bad number. It was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3437.4s	3437.4	 pretty bad number, but the markets were pretty responsive to it. And, and then it's been pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3445.1s	3445.1	 responsive the rest of the week, despite a whole bunch of stuff. I don't know if you guys saw,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3448.5s	3448.5	 but like yesterday, there was this crazy article where, you know, one of the Fed governors was like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3452.5s	3452.5	 we should raise by 100 basis points by July. And, you know, we should do eight, eight raises. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3458.5s	3458.5	 the markets were like, what are you talking about? And why is that? Because now people have started
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3464.0s	3464.0	 to look, you know, I've mentioned this before, when you go into a rate cycle, we're kind of past,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3470.0s	3470.0	 worrying about how many we kind of look to the end, and decide what we want to believe about the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3475.4s	3475.4	 future. And one of the most interesting things is the rate of change of this inflation was actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3482.9s	3482.9	 lower month over month. And so if you think about it that way, we had a bad CPI print, but it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3489.4s	3489.4	 actually not going up as much. And in fact, it's starting to trail off. And a lot of economists now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3493.6s	3493.6	 forecast basically this inflation peaking or already having peaked over the last few weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3500.6s	3500.6	 Consumer sentiment is not so good. A lot of us are now shifting our consumption away from goods
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3506.4s	3506.4	 to more services. We're stopping, you know, the hoarding of the toilet papers of the world,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3511.6s	3511.6	 if you will. And so I'm not a big buyer of this trade, to be honest with you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3515.8s	3515.8	 Freeberg, I think that it works in the short term. I don't think it's an investment. I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3520.0s	3520.0	 at some point, you're going to have to make a decision about what your view on energy is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3523.2s	3523.2	 I agree. I don't think this is a long term trade. That's right. But I do think that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3528.4s	3528.4	 macro sentiment sent the market in one direction. It creates this it created a buying opportunity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3533.0s	3533.0	 which I was pretty clear about. And I do think that some of this global tension stuff we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3536.7s	3536.7	 seeing is only going to drive it up for a while. I do I do think, however, that the the this big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3543.4s	3543.4	 tech spread trade is moving from a trade to an investment, actually. And that I didn't expect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3552.3s	3552.3	 And the reason is, I talked to a bunch of folks on Wall Street over this past week. And they told
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3557.6s	3557.6	 me two things. And one of them is a segue, because I think we should talk about Microsoft,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3561.1s	3561.1	 which is another brilliant move in the lexicon of business. But what they said was, Facebook has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3567.4s	3567.4	 become a funding short for other investments. Now, what does that mean? Everybody was crowded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3574.6s	3574.6	 into big tech. We talked about this before, right? Those five stocks were broadly owned,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3578.3s	3578.3	 they were effectively the index. But after that, after that earnings report, a lot of investors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3586.6s	3586.6	 including retail investors had to decide where to reallocate their capital, and had to decide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3592.7s	3592.7	 where to invest, where the money was going to come from to invest in these other names that were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3596.9s	3596.9	 really beaten up. And what folks on Wall Street have been telling me is that, you know, Facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3602.0s	3602.0	 has become what's called a funding short, meaning there is no bid to buy that from institutional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3606.0s	3606.0	 owners. They'd rather on the margin sell it to generate the cash to then take and invest in other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3611.1s	3611.1	 things. And what you saw over this past week is the bottoming out of a lot of these growth stocks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3617.6s	3617.6	 that were beaten up, right? They rallied pretty significantly every day, three, four, five, six
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3622.2s	3622.2	 percent rallies. And other names in big tech have rallied really well, including Microsoft.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3628.0s	3628.0	 And so I think that there is the potential, a small potential, that that's going from a trade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3633.9s	3633.9	 to an investment, actually a sustainable trend that you can bank on for several years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3638.0s	3638.0	 Investment hold the sock for five, 10 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3640.3s	3640.3	 The trade that spread trade you can hold for a long period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3642.6s	3642.6	 But for the winners to be the winners in that just so people get refreshed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3646.1s	3646.1	 Google's a winner in that. Microsoft, Google, Microsoft, Google. And then you feel Amazon,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3650.0s	3650.0	 Facebook, obviously, and Netflix are the losers in that trade. Still feel that way?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3656.0s	3656.0	 I think that Microsoft and Google are far and away the winners, far and away the winners. And look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3660.3s	3660.3	 you saw you saw you saw this Microsoft thing today or sorry, this past week. So smart, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3665.6s	3665.6	 Yeah. So just to give catch people up on that, Microsoft has made another savvy move to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3669.9s	3669.9	 approval for their $75 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition. They promised their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3675.3s	3675.3	 video game app store would operate with open market principles. CEO of the year, Satya Nadella,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3683.4s	3683.4	 and others travel to Washington, Nadella, Nadella, right, the same at the end,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3688.8s	3688.8	 travels to Washington this week to meet with regulators regarding the acquisition. So they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3692.8s	3692.8	 are proactively going to Washington as opposed to other people who maybe are not quote from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3697.8s	3697.8	 Microsoft President Brad Smith, we are more focused on adopting, adapting to regulation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3703.5s	3703.5	 than fighting against it. That's some really interesting. There's a there's a famous story
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3709.6s	3709.6	 about this explorer named Hernando Cortez, where, you know, we've all heard this analogy, or this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3714.6s	3714.6	 this, this little phrase before, where, you know, when they were exploring,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3725.1s	3725.1	 looking for America, etc. The famous phrase is burn the boats. Yep. Right. Can't go back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3730.2s	3730.2	 we have to find our way make it work. The the way that that's been extended in business is sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3736.4s	3736.4	 what we would call scorched the earth. And there's a competitive move that a lot of businesses, if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3741.7s	3741.7	 they're smart enough can execute, which is to effectively take a key market, and take an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3747.4s	3747.4	 economic view of that market, where you say that we're going to take all the economic value away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3752.4s	3752.4	 from it. And I think this is a first step towards a really interesting play that Microsoft could pull,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3759.1s	3759.1	 which is essentially to scorch the earth of app stores, which is Google's and Apple's really big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3764.7s	3764.7	 money printer to make a completely open permissible platform with very little to no take rate. And in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3771.4s	3771.4	 a market as big as video games, I think what it does is it creates pressure on all these other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3776.3s	3776.3	 mega platforms to essentially copy them. And I think Friedberg mentioned this before Google has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3781.6s	3781.6	 actually been the best in doing this by finding these key markets, or I think it was Sachs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3786.0s	3786.0	 you know, Chrome and other things and giving them away for free. Google is in a position to make the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3790.5s	3790.5	 app store effectively free. And then that puts Apple on a little bit of a desert island. So Jason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3796.0s	3796.0	 back to why I think you can keep Apple in that basket of shorts. The competitive pressures are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3800.7s	3800.7	 mounting by by the moves of Microsoft that I think are easier for Google to copy, and very difficult
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3805.6s	3805.6	 for companies like Apple to copy because it creates an incredible disincentive. Yeah. And also as part
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3811.3s	3811.3	 of this open app store concept, they will let you use any payment system. So if you're on an iPhone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3817.3s	3817.3	 and you want to use Apple Pay with a Google app purchase, you can do that. And if you're on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3821.7s	3821.7	 you know, Microsoft, you can use PayPal as an example. Sachs, what do you what do you think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3825.6s	3825.6	 about inflation? Okay, there was a really interesting chart on inflation that actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3829.1s	3829.1	 zero hedge tweeted. And I threw it up in the notes here, where they said real hourly earnings are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3835.4s	3835.4	 negative 1.7%. It's the 10th month in a row where us incomes aren't keeping up with inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3842.0s	3842.0	 So the problem here is that, you know, people's incomes have increased with inflation, but not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3849.1s	3849.1	 as much as the inflation rate. So the net effect of it is that people are feeling worse off when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3854.4s	3854.4	 they go to the grocery store to buy groceries or whatever they need. They don't feel as rich. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3859.9s	3859.9	 the fundamental problem here. And I think there's a lot of people out there who think that there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3864.9s	3864.9	 free lunch that if we printed 2 trillion worth of stimulus checks, this is the whole that $2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3870.8s	3870.8	 trillion bill last year, they shoveled through, I think the idea was, we're going to print as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3875.2s	3875.2	 much money as we can for the election. And it's going to help us in the midterms. Actually,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3879.5s	3879.5	 as it turns out, it boosted inflation so much that people are feeling worse off, even though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3884.4s	3884.4	 their wages went up slightly, because on a net basis, their earnings are down. So I just think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3889.5s	3889.5	 it's a good reminder that you can't just like print wealth, you can't print your way to prosperity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3897.2s	3897.2	 no free lunches, there's no free lunches. Yeah, or we're going to create addiction to universal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3902.6s	3902.6	 income or universal subsidy. That's the alternative is people are going to basically try and vote to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3908.0s	3908.0	 make some programs that were initially meant to be temporary more permanent, in order to keep up the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3912.8s	3912.8	 the lifestyle that they've been accustomed to. Just just to build on Sax's point, the University
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3917.9s	3917.9	 of Michigan consumer sentiment was released, I think it was today this morning. And it shows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3922.7s	3922.7	 exactly what he's saying, which is that, you know, consumers propensity and confidence in the economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3926.7s	3926.7	 has been falling off a cliff. You know, the month over month change was almost it was down 8.2%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3933.5s	3933.5	 The year over year change is down almost 20%. Current economic conditions was down 20%. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3940.5s	3940.5	 then index of consumer expectations down 19%. So to to Sax's point, people are scared.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3947.8s	3947.8	 Yeah, well, we've been we've been talking on the show for the last, I'd say a couple of months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3951.1s	3951.1	 about balancing the risk of recession versus the risk of inflation. Inflation, I think has gotten
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3956.4s	3956.4	 slightly worse at the print, went from with the last print was like 7.1% now some point 5%. So to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3963.3s	3963.3	 Jamal's point earlier, it's getting worse, but the rate of how fast it's getting worse,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3968.6s	3968.6	 but the risk of recession, I think is increasing. Because what's keeping this economy going is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3973.8s	3973.8	 consumer. And if the consumer sentiment now all of a sudden is tanking, and people feel poor because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3978.8s	3978.8	 of inflation, I just you know, now that the risks are starting to become sentiment, a sentiment goes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3984.8s	3984.8	 down, this is where governors play a critical role. Because if they don't open up these economies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3989.3s	3989.3	 we can't actually have a consumer led consumption rebound of the economy, because there aren't any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3994.0s	3994.0	 services to buy because you can't actually be around anybody. So if the economy remains
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=3998.3s	3998.3	 effectively closed, and people are done buying, you know, tubs of margarine and toilet paper,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4004.3s	4004.3	 because you know, Armageddon isn't coming as we were worried it would,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4008.3s	4008.3	 what are we supposed to be doing? So this is how these things interplay. So we have to get these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4012.5s	4012.5	 again, going back to where we started, we have to get this economy open, and we have to just get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4017.2s	4017.2	 back to some sense of normalcy, and the consumer will lead us out. But I think, Sax, you're right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4022.5s	4022.5	 on the margin, I think the risk is towards a recession, because people don't see this Thomas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4026.1s	4026.1	 Sowell, who's a well known Stanford, he's a I think he's a senior fellow at Hoover. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4031.7s	4031.7	 he has this comment, which is effectively taxes are bad for the rich, and the poor, but inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4038.8s	4038.8	 is bad just for the poor. And the reason he says that is because, you know, if you're wealthy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4044.6s	4044.6	 you can transition to assets that are sort of inflation adjusted or inflation protected,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4048.9s	4048.9	 right, you can consume assets, you can purchase assets to protect yourself. But inflation is an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4054.4s	4054.4	 exceptionally regressive means of the government taking compensation away from you current
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4058.4s	4058.4	 compensation, and it disproportionately affects working class ordinary people. And so if you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4063.2s	4063.2	 real wages that are negative inflation, that's high. That's confiscatory, right? You are you are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4069.5s	4069.5	 meaningfully less well off than you were before. And, you know, wealthy folks have a way to hedge,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4074.1s	4074.1	 but normal ordinary working class people do not. And on the margin, then if they then do not go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4078.9s	4078.9	 out and spend, the problem will be some sort of recessionary effect. I also think if we open up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4084.8s	4084.8	 more people might, since they're so lonely and getting weird staying at home, I think they might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4089.4s	4089.4	 actually want to go do jobs to socialize and do things I'm seeing people want to get out and do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4096.0s	4096.0	 you know, trips with their teams and they're and they're sick of staying home, Salesforce just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4100.1s	4100.1	 bought a retreat center and we saw this out of the city, the Bay Area and because Benioff's got a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4105.8s	4105.8	 concern, I guess that all these employees he hired over two years who've never met another Salesforce

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4115.7s	4115.7	 David, you're right. I think history is going to be really judgmental of Biden. If he is the last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4120.5s	4120.5	 person to basically give the green light and all of these democratic governors basically revolt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4126.8s	4126.8	 and open up under underneath, you know, either silence or the complete opposite point of view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4133.5s	4133.5	 This is a really bad setup. Well, National Journal, which again is not some right wing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4138.4s	4138.4	 publication, they're just sort of a an analyst of what's happening in Washington said that Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4142.7s	4142.7	 that an article Biden is blowing his COVID moment, he was elected to lead us back to normalcy. All
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4146.9s	4146.9	 he had to do was say, guys, it's time for the restrictions to come off and take credit for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4151.8s	4151.8	 fact that we were that the whole country was ready to move on. And he's kind of missed it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4157.5s	4157.5	 And but this trucker convoy is coming to Washington gives him one more chance, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4163.2s	4163.2	 to get on the right side of this because there's really two ways he can react. One is to treat them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4168.5s	4168.5	 as, you know, domestic terrorists, you know, racist, white supremacist, insurrectionaries,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4174.2s	4174.2	 or he can, you know, embrace them. And so all he has to do is say, listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4181.0s	4181.0	 we love you, we respect you, we hear you, we agree with you, it's time for these mandates to end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4187.2s	4187.2	 And you know what, thank you, Rachel Walensky and Anthony Fauci for your service. We understand

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4196.6s	4196.6	 We're getting rid of all these restrictions. His popularity would like bounce five points,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4200.9s	4200.9	 10 points if he did that. Yeah, I'm betting he's going to I mean, he's he's always represented the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4256.2s	4256.2	 and called fringe and cooks and conspiracy theorists. They're the ones who provided the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4274.8s	4274.8	 leadership. It's a politician who gets up there and leads us back to normalcy. Why can't Biden do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4280.4s	4280.4	 that? There's a great article in the Times and they profiled, you know, a couple people and one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4284.4s	4284.4	 of them was a mom in New York who's running for Congress against, you know, an intense and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4310.0s	4310.0	 you know, the governor basically said, okay, mask mandates can go on X state, the county supervisors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4319.8s	4319.8	 have not decided. So for example, in Santa Clara County, you know, they've not said yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4342.0s	4342.0	 And we're all just supposed to listen. Now, the reason why she has this authority is because Newsom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4347.0s	4347.0	 is granted to her under Newsom's state of emergency. So, what he should do is end that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4369.6s	4369.6	 said, please put your mask on and they were walking up to people like, could you not, and putting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4373.6s	4373.6	 this like little round sign in people's faces and not talking to them just, you know, and they would

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4382.3s	4382.3	 you put the hot dog down and then they come up and put the sign in your face, then you put your mask

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4390.0s	4390.0	 just weird and nowhere else are you seeing it. And then you go to a restaurant and the employees are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4396.9s	4396.9	 wearing masks and nobody else is. Jared Ranere Nick, I hope you can find it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4400.0s	4400.0	 So weird. There was this clip on Twitter when the mask mandate was lifted in Nevada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4406.5s	4406.5	 And it was a clip of kids in like grade two or three. And they went crazy. Okay. And the reason

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4420.8s	4420.8	 heard this more beautifully said, these children can finally see their friends as emotions on their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4427.9s	4427.9	 face. Oh my god, can you imagine if you're four, five, six, seven years old, and you cannot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4434.6s	4434.6	 understand the emotions of other kids? Because you're covered up in a mask. And you've only had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4440.4s	4440.4	 an experience in school. Two years in school. My six year old has never attended a day of school

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4449.7s	4449.7	 was at like the I was at horses with one of my kids last weekend. And there were a bunch of kids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4454.6s	4454.6	 out there riding. It's sunny, it's outside, they're on a horse, they're all wearing masks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4459.7s	4459.7	 In a voluntary optional situation. I'm just like how brainwashed this generation that we're raising.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4465.5s	4465.5	 I mean, they're going to be so neurotic, but they're also like brainwashed. I mean, it's,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4470.5s	4470.5	 it's crazy. We see it in the Bay Area, like I'll have a party with the kids or a group of kids come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4475.9s	4475.9	 over. And there's two or three parents who show up at the house. We only do outdoor parties, obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4480.4s	4480.4	 Two or three of the 10 kids will have masks on their parents will have masks on and like the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4483.9s	4483.9	 intense and 95 like sealed masks. And I'm like, you want to take your mask off for a picture and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4489.1s	4489.1	 one of the kids refused to take her mask off for a picture outside at a birthday party. I was like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4494.6s	4494.6	 Okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4495.7s	4495.7	 listen, I mean, when I supported the mass mandate, the very beginning of the pandemic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4499.2s	4499.2	 it was always as an interim measure. If I had known that people would want to continue this thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4504.0s	4504.0	 forever. There's no way I would have supported it also probably was effective in the early days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4508.6s	4508.6	 I don't think we know what the psychological impact to children is when they don't understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4512.1s	4512.1	 other people's emotions. And you do it over a long period of time. No, we don't. I think that's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4515.9s	4515.9	 fair statement. We don't know the impact. It's probably not zero. And so at some point, we need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4523.1s	4523.1	 to look at the risks, calculate some expected value. And the people we need to prioritize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4530.4s	4530.4	 are those that are the youngest. Okay. And I've said this before. And it's like, the teacher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4536.3s	4536.3	 unions need to understand that calculus, parents already understand that calculus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4541.6s	4541.6	 I don't think the state legislators, governors and the federal bureaucracy yet understands
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4545.8s	4545.8	 this calculus. But it's time to return to normal and time to return to sorry, and on this point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4551.6s	4551.6	 I would like to bring up something. The ACLU thing, just because I think I would love to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4557.7s	4557.7	 get your take on, you know, talking about civil liberties and freedoms. There are things that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4562.4s	4562.4	 are happening here under our noses every day. Under Democratic and Republican presidents that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4571.5s	4571.5	 to me, when I saw this on the ACLU Twitter feed yesterday was shocking. Jason, do you want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4577.1s	4577.1	 tee that up? All right. In other news, the CIA has been secretly conducting surveillance programs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4581.7s	4581.7	 to capture Americans private information on Thursday. Democratic senators widen and Heinrich

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4592.1s	4592.1	 called for greater transparency into the CIA's data collection of private US citizens. Basically,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4598.5s	4598.5	 the CIA used executive order 12333, which was signed by Reagan in 1981 to gather data on US
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4606.2s	4606.2	 citizens. The letter notes the program was, quote, entirely outside the statutory framework that

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4618.0s	4618.0	 letter, quote, clearly shows that the CIA is not just trying to collect data from the CIA,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4623.6s	4623.6	 but it's trying to collect data from the CIA. And the letter, quote, is a collection of data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4628.8s	4628.8	 from the CIA, and without any judicial congressional or even executive branch oversight that comes from

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4639.9s	4639.9	 demonstrate is that many of the same concerns that Americans have about their privacy and civil

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4649.6s	4649.6	 I mean, where where where is the mainstream media while they breathlessly run around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4654.4s	4654.4	 chasing cancellation stories? Where are they to report and to hold accountable this stuff?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4660.4s	4660.4	 And where are politicians in actually doing their job? But, you know, I don't think there's ever been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4666.5s	4666.5	 this kind of overreach that's just constantly been going on with zero accountability or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4671.2s	4671.2	 transparency into it. You know, the FBI is responsible for domestic laws, right? And the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4676.8s	4676.8	 FBI has a very clear path in which they need to get warrants in order to be able to surveil US
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4682.1s	4682.1	 citizens. And then the fact that we give an agency whose responsibility is actually foreign, yes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4688.2s	4688.2	 to basically stay as here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4689.2s	4689.2	 The CIA is supposed to work only on international, not domestic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4692.1s	4692.1	 And then to basically spy on its citizens with zero accountability or reporting, it seems to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4696.0s	4696.0	 a pretty important issue that should at least be discussed, especially in a world now where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4700.1s	4700.1	 executive power just keeps ramping up and ramping up what's going on and there's zero
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4704.1s	4704.1	 transparency or accountability. If I didn't randomly see this on an ACLU tweet, would we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4708.6s	4708.6	 even be talking about this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4710.1s	4710.1	 Probably not. And the and the other thing that's crazy about it is I think the way they get away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4715.0s	4715.0	 with this Chamath, and this has been something that the Patriot Act had a similar technique is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4721.5s	4721.5	 they the CIA and some other organizations will track international people of interest,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4727.7s	4727.7	 money launders, etc. And then say in order to track them, well, anybody they contact in America
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4733.3s	4733.3	 is fair game. Or if they're, you know, and so you can get the metadata from the phone calls and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4738.0s	4738.0	 emails. And I think that's how a lot of this gets just what this letter seems to say is we just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4742.8s	4742.8	 there's a broad scale surveillance program against US citizens that is indeterminate in scope and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4748.7s	4748.7	 scale. Right. So we don't know that seems very different than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4752.2s	4752.2	 And then in in parallel to this, there's also that announcement that the Department of Homeland
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4756.4s	4756.4	 Security is creating this major apparatus, this infrastructure to go after domestic terrorists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4762.3s	4762.3	 Well, look, if they mean people who actually like set off bombs or commit real crimes, fine. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4768.8s	4768.8	 Chamath, you asked where the media is the media is defining routine political descent as domestic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4774.3s	4774.3	 terrorism. Now, I mean, you hear this type of threat inflation, we've heard these truckers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4778.7s	4778.7	 even described as insurrectionists. So you know, how are these programs going to be used is really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4784.1s	4784.1	 the question. You create this massive infrastructure under the executive branch, we've seen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4789.2s	4789.2	 that in Washington, this trend towards criminalizing political disagreements where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4794.2s	4794.2	 Democrats, Republicans have been putting their partisans in jail for years. But are they now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4798.9s	4798.9	 going to apply this to political disagreements in the country? Can they use these powers to go after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4804.4s	4804.4	 truckers who are engaging in civil disobedience? Can they use these surveillance powers to go after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4809.3s	4809.3	 somebody who just tweets things on social media that they don't like? I mean, these are the open
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4814.0s	4814.0	 questions. Yeah, it's very scary. Well, and it's also hard to determine because you might have some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4818.4s	4818.4	 people on the right, who are protesting something in a very valid way. And then you get some whack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4824.0s	4824.0	 jobs like the Oath Keepers who are bringing in tons of weapons outside the DC area on January 6. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4829.5s	4829.5	 there's a valid concern here with all those weapons, the Oath Keepers brought, and their plans to do a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4834.5s	4834.5	 coordinated takeover after they first got in there. But then you have the other dipshits who are there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4838.0s	4838.0	 are probably just there to have fun and bang drums and support Trump, right? Do you think these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4843.6s	4843.6	 truckers are engaged in insurrection? Well, I mean, we don't know. And I don't think so. No,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4847.8s	4847.8	 I mean, if they if they bring a bunch of guns, then yes, we should have concerns. But I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4851.8s	4851.8	 think they are the slippery slope is when you have an executive order that is not governed by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4857.6s	4857.6	 the standard guardrails that we use to have checks and balances between these kinds of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4862.2s	4862.2	 government agencies and the people and the elected officials that we elect. Here's how it basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4867.7s	4867.7	 gets in a really tricky place. You have it lets I'm just going to use Justin Trudeau's quote,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4872.1s	4872.1	 okay, but replace that person with any politician in power. Hey, there's a small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4876.0s	4876.0	 fringe minority of people who are on their way here. They hold unacceptable views. Well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4882.2s	4882.2	 you know what that person is going to do that person is going to want to do everything in their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4885.3s	4885.3	 power to basically understand break apart and tear up that fringe minority group. Now, isn't that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4894.8s	4894.8	 scary? Right? When you have this overheated political rhetoric that describes your political
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4900.0s	4900.0	 opponents, your dissenters of the state, yeah, as enemies as white supremacists as Nazis,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4906.8s	4906.8	 as insurrectionaries as domestic terrorists, why wouldn't then the law enforcement arms of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4912.2s	4912.2	 our government then treat them that way? I mean, does the Department of Homeland Security or the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4917.1s	4917.1	 CIA or the FBI, do they understand that the politicians are just engaging in rhetoric in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4922.5s	4922.5	 threat inflation? Or will they take that those invocations literally to what we have to investigate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4929.6s	4929.6	 and stop these? I think they've done a Department of Justice done a pretty good job of that. I just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4933.8s	4933.8	 want I just brought this up because I think it's really important for somebody in the mainstream
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4937.2s	4937.2	 media of which many listen to this podcast. Sure. You have a responsibility to actually double click
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4942.7s	4942.7	 into this issue and figure out what's going on, please. Yeah. For on behalf of all of us. By the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4947.3s	4947.3	 way, like if you guys look, I mean, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, BBC, everyone covered it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4952.6s	4952.6	 today. But the story today is that lawmakers made this claim with no details and no evidence. So I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4959.2s	4959.2	 sure the investigations are underway. I mean, the journalists are clearly leaning in to identify,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4964.4s	4964.4	 you know, the the evidence behind the story. And I'm sure more will come out over the coming days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4968.0s	4968.0	 and weeks. And in fairness, like you said, is the Justice Department doing this even handedly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4971.7s	4971.7	 they were very specific with the January six Interactions Acts where they went after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4976.4s	4976.4	 oath keepers because they had a coordinated, they're a militia, they literally refer to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4980.6s	4980.6	 themselves as a militia. And those people are getting treated very different than the people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4984.6s	4984.6	 who broke glass or sat on pants Pelosi's desk, those people are getting three months suspended
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4988.9s	4988.9	 sentences, six months sentences, and the oath keepers who are a militia, they call themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4994.0s	4994.0	 a militia, they're dangerous, and they're treating them very differently. And they're the only ones
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=4997.7s	4997.7	 who are being charged with the more serious 10 to 20 year sentences. So I would say they are doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=5002.4s	5002.4	 a great job. All right, everybody, this has been an amazing journey from truckers to Joe Rogan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=5009.2s	5009.2	 and all the way to Uranus and back for the Rain Man David Sachs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=5018.1s	5018.1	 the Sultan of Science,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=5027.3s	5027.3	 love you boys. We'll see you all next time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=68&t=5069.2s	5069.2	 This like sexual tension that they just need to release.
