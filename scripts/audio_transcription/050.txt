https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=167.6s	167.6	 I brought it at a discount but you're holding correct
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=176.6s	176.6	 If something appreciates at what point is the appreciation in an asset that you've invested in early something you need to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=191.6s	191.6	 Well, I think you have to put things in a bucket of like is it an investment or is it something that represents an idea?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=198.8s	198.8	 That you love so much if it's the latter you should never sell if it's the former. Yeah, you got a man
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=204.1s	204.1	 I'm asking or rather, you know, is it a trade or is it something you want to own?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=208.4s	208.4	 by the way, let me just clean this up because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=211.3s	211.3	 Solana was not a direct investment for us. What we did is we invested in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=216.1s	216.1	 in a crypto
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=218.1s	218.1	 Venture firm called multi coin capital. This is back in 2017
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=222.5s	222.5	 We realized like crypto was becoming like a full-time job for us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=226.0s	226.0	 It was a total rabbit hole and we were like we don't have time to figure out this like 24-7 trading stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=231.1s	231.1	 But we met Colin to Char who were these two young guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=234.7s	234.7	 We met him through Vinny Lingham actually and they were creating multi coin capital and we actually invested we gave him a million bucks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=241.4s	241.4	 At a 20 cap to help set up their firm and then we invested in their they had a both a venture fund and a hedge fund
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=248.1s	248.1	 And they were like the first money into Solana. So that fund I mean, it's it's like a hundred X fund
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=254.5s	254.5	 It's just like bonkers crazy. And so as a result of that we are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=259.2s	259.2	 indirect beneficiaries of this huge increase in Solana it will end up being about you know, a billion dollars of I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=267.6s	267.6	 think Solana for us in terms of returns, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=270.8s	270.8	 But it's the multi coin guys determine the trading decisions on that. Yeah, and so people who don't know Solana is a programmable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=278.7s	278.7	 You know aetherium competitor, I guess and it's at 50 billion dollars or so market cap. It was trading at a dollar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=285.6s	285.6	 Not long ago and now it's at 164. It's an aetherium competitor basically for you know, a smart contract platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=292.3s	292.3	 And there's a lot of people I'd say smart money in Silicon Valley who are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=296.7s	296.7	 betting on a flippening where Solana could ultimately overtake aetherium as the preferred platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=304.1s	304.1	 But even if it doesn't overtake aetherium, you know, it's the number eight cryptocurrency right now, you know, it could go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=310.1s	310.1	 There's a lot of people betting it'll go to number three or you know, what have you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=313.9s	313.9	 additionally, it is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=315.8s	315.8	 fraction of a penny for a transaction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=318.9s	318.9	 And it can do many more transactions than aetherium. So it's you know, technically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=324.4s	324.4	 Should be much cheaper if you're buying NFTs right now. You're probably spending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=329.2s	329.2	 You know tens of dollars, you know in fees on aetherium
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=333.6s	333.6	 Whereas if you did those same NFTs, which some people are starting to do on Solana
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=338.2s	338.2	 They would cost a fraction of a penny correct David or Tramont
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=342.1s	342.1	 Yeah, I think the the platform is is known for being a faster cheaper, you know blockchain really really congratulations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=349.2s	349.2	 and if Vinnie Lingham's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=351.5s	351.5	 Instagram is any indication he did pretty well because his Instagram suddenly turned into a world tour on private jets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=357.6s	357.6	 Like which which which island should I buy and well like Vinnie was sort of like a I don't think he's full-time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=364.4s	364.4	 Multi-coin, but he was sort of a venture partner to Kyle and to Char and he helped set them up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=369.5s	369.5	 This is back in 2017. He helped bring us in as the first investors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=374.4s	374.4	 yeah, I mean for us it was sort of a founder bet combined with a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=379.3s	379.3	 Like a team like sort of a space bet like we knew the cryptocurrencies were starting to be traded 24-7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=385.9s	385.9	 It required more of like a hedge fund skill set than what we had and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=391.0s	391.0	 So we made you know, we made a bet on those guys and man
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=394.0s	394.0	 What are the nice strategies right sax is if you are LP in new?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=399.5s	399.5	 Fund managers, which I've done a couple of times now you get to learn from them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=405.7s	405.7	 And basically dive into a data set of a new market, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=410.2s	410.2	 I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=410.5s	410.5	 It's like one of the nice things about being an LP in a fund is you can place a small bet whether it's 50k or 500k
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=416.3s	416.3	 Or 5 million whatever it is you you get like this meta education of an entire sector, correct?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=422.5s	422.5	 Yeah, but I think you know, we didn't do it to learn from them. Although we have it's more that we realized that crypto was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=429.9s	429.9	 Like I said becoming such a rabbit hole like it we realized we would either need to do crypto full-time as a fund
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=435.3s	435.3	 Or we would need to like partner with people who actually did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=438.6s	438.6	 And you see that with like a lot of VC firms now is there creating like specialized crypto funds or at least they have specialized crypto partners
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=445.2s	445.2	 There's so much to know about the crypto world. It's a hard thing to invest in unless you're like totally focused on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=450.8s	450.8	 I've struggled with that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=452.0s	452.0	 Like I've tried to go deep on a couple topics and like I realized holy shit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=456.0s	456.0	 I've been in this for like four to six hours just trying to learn this stuff and I'm not like there and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=459.7s	459.7	 Then I feel uncertain about making any decisions. I I totally get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=464.0s	464.0	 I mean you got to have folks like working on this and the pace is changing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=467.0s	467.0	 So rapidly you really need to kind of be up to date on what's next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=470.6s	470.6	 You know what the other issue is when you look at crypto people use the word crypto as if it's like that's all there is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=477.1s	477.1	 Totally crypto is like that's like computing. Yeah, right. E cash cryptography
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=483.3s	483.3	 You know financial modeling or building new economic systems to moth. There's business model innovation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=489.9s	489.9	 There's technology innovation. There's economic innovation. It's a computing innovation. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=495.0s	495.0	 Computer computing innovation. Yeah infrastructure infrastructure hardware. I mean, there's there's quite a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=501.5s	501.5	 Layers of activity to moth. Are you spending time in crypto yourself or do you have people doing it for you? Or how are you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=507.5s	507.5	 Kind of yeah, we have look we have we have a lot of it a lot of a lot of everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=515.3s	515.3	 So yeah, we have things but you go deep yourself to moth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=518.3s	518.3	 Like how do you spend enough time to really get up to speed on all the goings-on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=523.2s	523.2	 I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=525.5s	525.5	 cherry pick and I snipe and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=528.2s	528.2	 Opportunities where I get intellectually curious and jump in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=531.9s	531.9	 But a lot of the credit goes to my team
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=535.0s	535.0	 there's a couple folks that spend a lot of their time in it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=539.6s	539.6	 You know, we've we've had a couple people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=543.1s	543.1	 Do extremely well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=545.3s	545.3	 For us, you know similar similar to David's story back in the day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=550.5s	550.5	 You know I invested in Barry Silbert and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=554.6s	554.6	 DCG market Barry Silbert. Yeah, and you know DCG is now I don't know. I'm guessing a 20 billion dollar company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=563.0s	563.0	 Maybe more I don't know how does it mechanically work with your team?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=565.9s	565.9	 They they are investigating opportunities and then they come to you and bring you you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=570.2s	570.2	 Hey, we'll do a meeting and I'm gonna share for with you and then you say I mean on the phone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=573.3s	573.3	 I know you basically go deep go deep when something shows up to moth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=576.8s	576.8	 No, so so basically what happens is they have carte blanche to do whatever they want and what they're typically doing is they're working with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=583.6s	583.6	 entrepreneurs to seed projects and you know to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=586.5s	586.5	 to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=587.5s	587.5	 To get projects off the ground and then at some point when those when those projects become deep large enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=593.7s	593.7	 Then they'll issue tokens and you know, we'll get a certain allocation of those tokens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=597.7s	597.7	 And so we've done that for you know, call it. I don't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=601.9s	601.9	 Some number of projects that we think are valuable then along the way, you know, they'll have certain views on Bitcoin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=607.7s	607.7	 They'll have certain views on a theory and they'll have certain views on Solana and we'll make capital allocation decisions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=613.7s	613.7	 They tend to have the ability to do whatever they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=616.5s	616.5	 And then what I tend to do is just think about when it gets above like it to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=621.1s	621.1	 I need to see the chance to make at least you know in the rough justice around, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=627.0s	627.0	 500 to a billion dollars and then I'll get involved but otherwise they just kind of run the whole thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=632.2s	632.2	 Let me ask you guys a question here. You know when you look at the market caps of these projects, it seems like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=639.6s	639.6	 Things are changing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=641.7s	641.7	 Cardona or cardona is number three now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=645.7s	645.7	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=646.8s	646.8	 Tether still remains number five xrp still number six, but so I would encourage people to not look at it like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=652.2s	652.2	 I think looking at it as a rank list betrays what it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=655.9s	655.9	 So, you know, i'll give you a simple example. Let's like that compare the fate of two projects or actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=661.4s	661.4	 Right now there's a distributed form of um discord
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=665.9s	665.9	 That's being built
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=667.8s	667.8	 Discord the chat app. Yeah, in a completely distributed way with an integrated crypto wallet because if you look at discord
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=674.5s	674.5	 It's really two cohorts of people there's gaming and there's crypto, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=678.2s	678.2	 So the two big ones. Yeah, so, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=680.8s	680.8	 That's an example of a really interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=683.0s	683.0	 Product that has some real potential then if you look at something like deso deso is a decentralized social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=692.9s	692.9	 Programming framework
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=694.9s	694.9	 Then if you look at something like helium that's completely about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=699.1s	699.1	 building a large distributed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=701.2s	701.2	 You know connection of um of on ramps to the internet so internet connectivity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=706.2s	706.2	 So those are three completely different ideas with three completely different paths to success
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=711.3s	711.3	 If to invest in those tokens you you have to believe in three totally different sets of things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=715.8s	715.8	 Yeah, so to look at it on a rank list and just buy something because it's cheap is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=720.4s	720.4	 Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, i'm just gonna be blunt. It's stupid. Don't do that. No, that wasn't really my question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=724.6s	724.6	 My question was, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=725.6s	725.6	 We we have an extraordinary number of the public who've invested in bitcoin and ethereum as number one and number two and those projects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=734.3s	734.3	 Feel maybe stagnant when compared to the dynamism of what i'll call
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=739.5s	739.5	 Dynamism of what i'll call, you know the projects launched in the last three or four years because they're at a different number
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=745.4s	745.4	 But you're talking about confusing again. That's what I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=747.5s	747.5	 Those are layer one protocols right meaning they are at the core substrate of how all of crypto is going to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=753.6s	753.6	 Then you have these other projects that build on top of these things in different ways or build around them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=758.2s	758.2	 so my point is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=759.9s	759.9	 If you don't have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=761.6s	761.6	 If you don't want to take the time to understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=764.5s	764.5	 Which layer twos you want to own and which layer ones you want to own and why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=769.2s	769.2	 I think you're much better off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=771.3s	771.3	 I understand your point my point is etf or something else because there are there are ways to own these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=776.0s	776.0	 So for example david david solana is does not need ethereum to exist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=782.1s	782.1	 So my point is do we do we see a day when?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=785.8s	785.8	 This you know the past decade has been about bitcoin and ethereum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=789.3s	789.3	 Do we see a day when maybe people stop buying those and start buying these new ones anything's possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=795.8s	795.8	 But here's here's the evolution in our thinking. I mean the first step was realizing. Okay, we need to own bitcoin. Why because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=803.3s	803.3	 You know, there's now enough evidence where what like a decade or more than a decade into this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=808.0s	808.0	 Nobody has been able to essentially counterfeit a bitcoin. It is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=813.5s	813.5	 You know new money it is it is better money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=816.4s	816.4	 So if you so i'm not going to convince people right now of the argument for bitcoin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=819.6s	819.6	 But if you believe in it, that's sort of the first step is you realize you really need to have one to two percent of your portfolio
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=825.4s	825.4	 In bitcoin in the event that fiat money sort of becomes debased and eventually you move to crypto
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=830.6s	830.6	 Then you realize well, wait a second bitcoin is just one application of blockchains. There's a bunch of applications of blockchains
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=836.2s	836.2	 So maybe we need to own not just sort of you know digital money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=840.3s	840.3	 But we also need to own the underlying blockchain platform and that leads you to ethereum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=844.2s	844.2	 Then you realize that there's a bunch of competitors to ethereum and it's still very early days and one of those guys might ultimately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=851.0s	851.0	 Displace ethereum as a blockchain platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=853.2s	853.2	 Then you realize that there's all these applications on top of all these blockchains
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=856.2s	856.2	 And so, you know the conclusion I come to after all of that is I can't figure all this out and well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=861.4s	861.4	 Maybe I could if I was willing to go back to school and like make this a full-time job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=865.9s	865.9	 Which I just don't want to do. I mean i'm lazy and that's why I focus on sas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=869.8s	869.8	 Like that's what I know your killzone. Yeah, like i'm not going to reinvent myself. It's like you playing holdem versus plo, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=876.7s	876.7	 Right exactly. So but this is why we partner with multi-coin capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=879.9s	879.9	 So what I would just say is like the idea that you as an individual investor are going to like, you know pick off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=886.1s	886.1	 The one cryptocurrency here or there to invest in I mean that's going to be a lottery
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=890.5s	890.5	 I would I would find a manager basically who is really good who has a track record who understands this stuff our approach is to hire very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=898.4s	898.4	 young
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=899.4s	899.4	 Extremely technical computer scientists and mathematicians to basically do the work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=905.6s	905.6	 That's that's working
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=906.7s	906.7	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=907.0s	907.0	 And you know one of the things that I think these guys do and the reason why it is very helpful for the big computer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=912.2s	912.2	 Scientists is these are all open source projects. So they go look at the repos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=916.7s	916.7	 Just go look at go look at what you see the changes being made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=920.1s	920.1	 And this is like do you realize there's only 12 people who are actively working on salana in the in the but you need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=925.6s	925.6	 You need to look at all the code check-ins seven of them work for salana
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=929.2s	929.2	 You need to look at all the code check-ins. You need to look at the velocity of the code check-ins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=932.7s	932.7	 So you can see like how many projects are being created on these platforms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=936.0s	936.0	 The white papers are also really exceptional. Like if you if you read these white papers, they are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=940.7s	940.7	 they're they're they're really incredibly thoughtful and and well written and you can really understand what their goals are and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=949.0s	949.0	 You can make some informed decisions there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=950.7s	950.7	 But again, if you're not going to be in the business of being in this ecosystem because I think david's right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=956.0s	956.0	 Everything is moving so fast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=958.3s	958.3	 What's successful today could be just a dog tomorrow and vice versa that I think speculating in this market will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=967.0s	967.0	 Not only will it be super volatile, but more than likely you're going to lose all your money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=970.6s	970.6	 So I would encourage people to not speculate in crypto
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=972.7s	972.7	 I would encourage you to figure out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=974.6s	974.6	 An elegant way of having an abstracted bet if to the extent you care about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=979.0s	979.0	 And by the way in the uk, for example, there are ways where you can own publicly traded mutual funds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=985.8s	985.8	 That give you exposure to this it's just like yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=988.9s	988.9	 Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=989.9s	989.9	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=990.3s	990.3	 But there are mutual funds of crypto the work find these mutual funds just own those things and let somebody else do the hard work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=996.1s	996.1	 Because this is too it's too hard some of the other investments we made back in 2017 2018 time frame
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1002.2s	1002.2	 One was a company called bitwise which was creating an etf for crypto. So it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1009.6s	1009.6	 A monthly rebalanced portfolio of I think the top 10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1013.1s	1013.1	 Cryptocurrencies and you could buy it they finally got approved by the sec and you can buy it like it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1018.3s	1018.3	 Like with a ticker symbol from your e-trade account or swabic alergy exactly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1022.6s	1022.6	 So that was that was pretty incredible to see the progress they've made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1026.4s	1026.4	 And then the other big bet we made was just institutional custody back in 2017
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1031.3s	1031.3	 We invested in bico actually bill lee helped found that company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1036.0s	1036.0	 Many years ago and then that became last year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1039.4s	1039.4	 Galaxy announced a deal to acquire them for I think 1.2 billion largest crypto acquisition to date
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1045.0s	1045.0	 The thesis there was just that crypto would go more institutional and I think we're starting to see that now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1050.0s	1050.0	 Where endowments and so on are realizing they need to have some portion maybe one or two percent of their portfolio in crypto
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1056.7s	1056.7	 And so, you know, it's unrealistic. Look, we have two almost three trillion dollars of market cap in crypto. It's unrealistic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1062.9s	1062.9	 For folks to expect people to be able to be living in discord channels and doing all of this work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1068.2s	1068.2	 I think what that means is that the sec is going to be asked increasingly more often
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1073.5s	1073.5	 to approve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1074.7s	1074.7	 Simpler on ramps for this stuff and now in the last week, by the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1077.9s	1077.9	 We had a pretty important two things happen both Jerome Powell and gary ganser basically said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1083.4s	1083.4	 Crypto is here to stay and you know, we're not going to ban this stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1086.1s	1086.1	 And so hopefully what it means is that you get some etfs passed in the united states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1090.3s	1090.3	 You know grayscale is one there could be more and I think that stuff makes it much easier for folks to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1095.8s	1095.8	 Own this stuff. Well clear regulation would be a great thing for the industry for people to buy into it and removing some of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1103.4s	1103.4	 Let's call them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1105.4s	1105.4	 I don't want to say bad actors, but people who are maybe questionable like tether, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1111.5s	1111.5	 I don't know if you saw the bloomberg story yesterday, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1114.0s	1114.0	 You know a bloomberg reporter basically found out that tether he got the list of what tether owns with their stablecoin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1119.8s	1119.8	 Owns with their stablecoin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1121.6s	1121.6	 and it looks like they're giving a lot of loans to other crypto projects and own a lot of chinese paper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1128.8s	1128.8	 In that they are basically making the float on 69 billion dollars sweeping it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1133.8s	1133.8	 which then incentivizes them to take risky bets because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1137.2s	1137.2	 They get paid on them and it's anything but a stablecoin. Yeah, if you think about it from that regard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1142.2s	1142.2	 It's I don't know the details on tether. I won't speak to that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1144.7s	1144.7	 But i'll say that any stablecoin if it's not 100%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1149.1s	1149.1	 backed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1150.4s	1150.4	 By dollars if that's the currency that's going in and out or other hard currency. That's not a stablecoin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1157.0s	1157.0	 Right, you know a stablecoin is supposed to be a service. It's not supposed to be a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1161.7s	1161.7	 Speculators currency. It's basically just supposed to be a mechanism by at the on ramps and off ramps of the crypto ecosystem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1169.0s	1169.0	 You can convert your dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1171.0s	1171.0	 into a temporary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1173.0s	1173.0	 Uh again stablecoin that will hold its value so you can a poker chip that you can use to then buy bitcoin or ethereum or whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1180.0s	1180.0	 Yeah, usdc usdc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1182.3s	1182.3	 Uh c jeremy allaire's circle competitor from circle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1187.6s	1187.6	 Just said that he would switch to 100% to what you're saying cash cash equivalents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1193.0s	1193.0	 Guys, this is this has always been a money market fund
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1195.3s	1195.3	 It should be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1196.4s	1196.4	 Right treated like a money market fund and it should be regulated and managed like a money market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1200.2s	1200.2	 Which was tether's original vision and then they flipped the script because I think they got greedy and now they own I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1205.6s	1205.6	 Because they were regulated by the way, by the way, it speaks to the role of regulation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1210.5s	1210.5	 Like, you know a lot of people have trust and faith because they make some claim
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1213.5s	1213.5	 But there's no regulator actually checking on their claims
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1216.0s	1216.0	 The only people that want regulation are two ends of the spectrum so young and so disruptive where they want rails to operate legally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1222.8s	1222.8	 And so big and so over the top that they want to basically entrench themselves for the rest of their lives. That's it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1228.4s	1228.4	 No, everybody in the middle doesn't really want regulation. What's a what's a way to create a company or if you're a big tech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1234.5s	1234.5	 You both want regulation. Well, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1236.9s	1236.9	 Yeah, but there are some narrow cases like again, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1240.4s	1240.4	 If if if a stable coin is going to say that we are just a money market fund
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1244.4s	1244.4	 We're 100 reserve. It is really nice to have a regulator somebody we trust to go in there and put the stamp of approval on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1252.2s	1252.2	 FDIC so we can trust it or an sro
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1255.0s	1255.0	 That is a valid role. I think for a regulator
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1257.8s	1257.8	 In traditional financial markets you have these self
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1260.5s	1260.5	 self-regulating bodies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1261.9s	1261.9	 Um, I think it's finner is a self-regulating body, right? And so, you know, some of these self-regulating bodies should be formed in the crypto community
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1268.6s	1268.6	 I don't know if they're doing this i'm so naive in this space
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1270.6s	1270.6	 But certainly would make sense to have an sro form that that does self-policing effectively within the community rather than try and bring in a government regulator
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1277.9s	1277.9	 Here's the thing if you police yourself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1280.2s	1280.2	 you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1281.4s	1281.4	 Really define the execution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1283.4s	1283.4	 And the ramifications of that policing if you have 30 call it competitors and cooperators in the in the market space doing this together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1291.3s	1291.3	 it can be a highly effective model for creating a system of trust and reliability and not having to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1297.8s	1297.8	 You know bring in, you know call it outside incompetence to overseeing the rules and rights
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1303.1s	1303.1	 Yeah, another area we need standards is around the token cap tables for these projects, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1308.1s	1308.1	 So how much how much of the token cap table goes to the founders?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1312.1s	1312.1	 What are the rules around them selling? What are those investing periods and what are the disclosures around them selling in public markets?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1318.8s	1318.8	 We have 10b5. So if you're an insider who runs these companies you have to disclose when you're selling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1324.2s	1324.2	 There's no similar rule for crypto. I think there probably should be right like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1328.1s	1328.1	 If you own the if you own the token and you run this project as publicly traded and the public can buy it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1333.9s	1333.9	 You should really probably have to disclose your your sales. Yes, and maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1338.6s	1338.6	 You know these it's very strange because they're running foundations and I had a crypto person on from a music crypto
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1345.5s	1345.5	 Project and he said they had like three or four hundred million in this project in panama
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1350.0s	1350.0	 I was like who's on the board of that and he's like I can't say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1352.5s	1352.5	 I don't know. Why can't you say and he said security reasons?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1355.2s	1355.2	 I was like well anybody who's on a public board has to be public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1358.5s	1358.5	 And of course they have you know people who are on the board of ge or ibm or amazon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1362.5s	1362.5	 They have security issues like they deal with their security issues. That doesn't mean they don't disclose who they are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1366.0s	1366.0	 It's like yeah, i'm not comfortable saying who they are and it's like, okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1368.4s	1368.4	 Well, they sold three or four hundred million. I was like, how do they give that money out? I'm like, he's like, i'm not sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1372.8s	1372.8	 I'm not on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1374.2s	1374.2	 I'm like what like there's some organization in panama. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1378.7s	1378.7	 Uh, it was really weird
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1380.6s	1380.6	 and I think one thing that i'll say positively about about these crypto founders is that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1386.2s	1386.2	 Uh will never allow a single venture investor to clog up their cap table number one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1391.9s	1391.9	 They do a great job of creating these large broad syndicates of participation when they seed their projects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1397.4s	1397.4	 And then you know a lot of it goes into treasury where then they issue coins as needed and I think that that strategy actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1403.5s	1403.5	 Is very pro employee and pro ecosystem. So, you know when we see these projects all these companies tend to raise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1411.0s	1411.0	 You know three four five million bucks. It all tends to be at like 30 million pre and it all tends to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1417.9s	1417.9	 Distributed so like, you know, you know, it's us and recent sequoia and it's like, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1421.8s	1421.8	 We put in 200 grand each or 400 grand each
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1425.0s	1425.0	 You know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1425.2s	1425.2	 That's why you're forced then go into the market if you believe in a project and then spend hundreds of millions of dollars to buy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1430.7s	1430.7	 Into it after the fact and I think that that's very um, very powerful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1435.3s	1435.3	 It's a really important dynamic that if it comes back to a traditional venture could be really disruptive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1441.4s	1441.4	 Why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1442.3s	1442.3	 Well, could you imagine a sas founder that basically all of a sudden says all right, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1446.5s	1446.5	 I'm raising a six million dollar series a you know craft can take 500k sequoia. You can have 500k
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1453.6s	1453.6	 um, you know blah-blah-blah folks and then you raise six million bucks that way and you never allow anybody to have more than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1460.6s	1460.6	 Call it, you know a few percent of a company. So the fact that it's like it's like a mini ipo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1465.6s	1465.6	 It's like a private ipo on santo road
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1468.2s	1468.2	 Yeah, and then your board construction looks entirely different and then as a result, you know founder protections probably go way up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1473.7s	1473.7	 Employee protections probably go way up. It's actually and goes way down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1477.3s	1477.3	 Uh, no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1478.7s	1478.7	 I actually think what will happen is you're less likely and around like that to be okay with some dork dingleberry joining your fucking board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1485.8s	1485.8	 You're going to actually point to some industry expert and say this person is joining my board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1491.2s	1491.2	 She does xyz job at such and such a startup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1494.3s	1494.3	 And then the investors say wow, well, that's a pretty great advocate for the business. Go ahead and do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1499.0s	1499.0	 Uh, another thing I learned about this whole token space was when I talked to anatoli from uh, solana
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1505.1s	1505.1	 When they sold their three or four hundred million tokens to fund
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1509.0s	1509.0	 Uh the company because they consider them utility tokens not shares. They paid taxes on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1514.9s	1514.9	 So the irs is getting massive amounts of tax revenue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1519.8s	1519.8	 Well think about it. They're selling the token. It's supposed to be for utility. Well, therefore it's a taxable event
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1524.1s	1524.1	 That actually was really smart. That is showing I think some wisdom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1527.9s	1527.9	 Because there's a lot of founders who want to have their cake and eat it too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1531.1s	1531.1	 Which is to say they want to say that these are utility tokens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1535.3s	1535.3	 And and they don't pay tax and then when they later get traded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1538.6s	1538.6	 They want to say that they're not you know, they're not securities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1540.7s	1540.7	 But so when does the tax get paid? I think it's really smart to pay the tax up front to establish that this is a corporate sale
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1547.2s	1547.2	 They're basically paying the corporate tax, right? Yes, that is what it's because this is this is the problem is if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1553.8s	1553.8	 If you wait until they're traded publicly and then say no, no, no their their utility tokens on security tokens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1559.4s	1559.4	 The government's gonna ask you well, why didn't you pay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1562.2s	1562.2	 Corporate income tax when you sold them, right? So that is actually showing some perspicacity. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1569.4s	1569.4	 uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1570.4s	1570.4	 Can somebody look that word up for me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1573.0s	1573.0	 Foresightedness jcal. Okay, great awesome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1576.4s	1576.4	 It's so great that you have the two producers on either side of you right now feeding you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1580.2s	1580.2	 Vocabulary words well done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1583.2s	1583.2	 So here's here's um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1585.4s	1585.4	 You know, uh another question with this if the majority of people sacks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1589.4s	1589.4	 Just put your legal hat on for a second
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1591.4s	1591.4	 If the majority of people who bought a token in a project we'll call it the you know, acme crypto project
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1596.8s	1596.8	 They buy acme coins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1599.0s	1599.0	 If they're buying them and they have absolutely no interest in using them for the utility and they say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1606.3s	1606.3	 I bought these as a speculative device and the founder says they're utility tokens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1610.2s	1610.2	 But let's say 70 percent of the people who bought them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1613.5s	1613.5	 Said I didn't buy them for that reason. They just came out right and said I bought this to speculate on the price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1619.3s	1619.3	 What should the government do should they deem them a security or should they deem them a utility token?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1625.2s	1625.2	 I think that's a complicated question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1627.2s	1627.2	 But I I think that there should be an opportunity for these cryptocurrencies to establish themselves as utility tokens because they are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1634.9s	1634.9	 They do serve a purpose. They are designed to be part of a system, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1640.1s	1640.1	 They're not just objects of speculation. And by the way, even if they were we don't we don't treat baseball cards as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1646.6s	1646.6	 You know as as sort of as security
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1649.0s	1649.0	 So it wouldn't necessarily make them a security just because they're speculated on they actually do serve a function in a designed computer system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1657.5s	1657.5	 So I think what's important here is that there's a safe harbor where these crypto companies know what the rules are and if they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1664.1s	1664.1	 if they can basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1666.2s	1666.2	 Meet the criteria such as by paying corporate income tax when they sell the tokens and other things like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1671.9s	1671.9	 That they won't later be deemed to be engaged in an unlawful sale of securities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1676.3s	1676.3	 I think the I think the important thing is just that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1679.1s	1679.1	 Entrepreneurs founders know what the rules are so they can abide by them and not be and they don't right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1684.5s	1684.5	 Well, so they don't get surprised later. They don't get whammied but with basically, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1689.3s	1689.3	 Because they are building something legitimate here, you know, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1693.1s	1693.1	 But it would seem to the sniff test if the people buying the tokens have no idea have never written a line of code have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1700.6s	1700.6	 No use for them. I don't see why that's relevant. I don't see why that's relevant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1705.0s	1705.0	 Well, because they're profiting off of them as if their shares and unlike baseball cards, which you can't sell a thousand baseball cards for an increasingly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1714.4s	1714.4	 You know in a very instantaneous way you would have to put them in an auction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1718.7s	1718.7	 You would have to put them in an auction. You could sell a lot of friction. There'd be a lot of friction. You can't trade it certainly like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1725.0s	1725.0	 Yeah, uh freeburg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1726.2s	1726.2	 What do you think if the majority of people buying a token are doing it to speculate?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1730.9s	1730.9	 Can the founder say it's a utility token and then those people who are trading it like either baseball cards?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1736.2s	1736.2	 minted coins, whatever analogy shares you want to use are in it for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1740.8s	1740.8	 Increase in the value should it be a security and should they have to play by the rules we play at in the traditional?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1746.6s	1746.6	 venture startup game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1748.8s	1748.8	 I mean the question is what's the utility?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1752.1s	1752.1	 So, I mean if you can demonstrate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1754.5s	1754.5	 some utility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1756.2s	1756.2	 Then maybe that's the uh, the the and this will probably be litigated at some point, right? Um, i'm sure there'll be enough capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1763.5s	1763.5	 Sloshing around here that someone will say, you know what we believe strong. I mean we're seeing this happen with ripple already
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1770.3s	1770.3	 But um, someone will litigate this and we'll get some clearer definition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1774.9s	1774.9	 On you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1775.8s	1775.8	 What statutes are going to be referenced and what those statutes might say with respect to the how this ties to the definition of utility and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1782.5s	1782.5	 Then that'll become hopefully a standard that people can kind of look to to guide them in the future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1787.2s	1787.2	 But it's definitely the wild west right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1789.2s	1789.2	 And everyone's going to try the reason I bring it up is because gensler was sort of uh floating this argument
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1794.6s	1794.6	 Chamath, what do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1797.1s	1797.1	 I think that um, you can't wipe three trillion dollars of value out of the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1803.0s	1803.0	 And so so pragmatically hard to do got it. So it's here to stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1809.0s	1809.0	 And it's too institutionalized now, so, you know, there's just way too many organized pools of capital that are now speculating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1816.6s	1816.6	 Inside of this entire ecosystem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1819.0s	1819.0	 You know, I saw a tweet today. There was a there's a firm I think like called jump trading or something. It's like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1824.5s	1824.5	 high-speed frequency trading
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1826.8s	1826.8	 Organization and they tweeted out some pictures where you know, they're they're uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1831.2s	1831.2	 They hired a bunch of folks to start a jump and they did a coding boot cap on solana
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1836.5s	1836.5	 That was their onboarding as an example. So when you have people in high finance, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1841.1s	1841.1	 Really vested in this thing and you have three trillion dollars of value that'll go to six trillion and then go to 10 trillion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1847.4s	1847.4	 This can't go away. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1849.5s	1849.5	 That's why I think powell and gensler had to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1853.1s	1853.1	 Some version of that on the record, which is you know, we're not going to ban this stuff because they know it's not possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1857.7s	1857.7	 So I think david's right you have to create some rules make folks and let folks pay their taxes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1863.9s	1863.9	 You know, I remember for example, like I did this bitcoin transaction in 2014 or something. I bought some land
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1869.1s	1869.1	 I used bitpay. I transferred some bitcoin bought the land blah blah blah. I was like, you know, whatever but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1875.3s	1875.3	 whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1876.5s	1876.5	 I yeah, I mean I I I left I mean I I owned a lot at the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1880.3s	1880.3	 So it wasn't that big of a deal. But my point is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1882.8s	1882.8	 Finding a way for me to pay my taxes was a huge deal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1885.1s	1885.1	 I remember and you know, we filed the tax return and we tried to make sure that we paid our taxes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1891.1s	1891.1	 These are very complicated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1893.0s	1893.0	 Even if you want to be conformant to the government, it's impossible right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1896.9s	1896.9	 So they just need to create some rules where folks can say here's what I own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1901.0s	1901.0	 Here's what it's worth. Tell me how much I owe you and we're all willing to pay or not. Maybe we're on I'm I am
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1907.4s	1907.4	 Because I just think it's like make sure that we can we can trade around it hedge it structure it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1913.1s	1913.1	 Do the things that we would normally do with any other risk assets right now. That's very hard and when you own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1918.8s	1918.8	 Lots of this stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1920.2s	1920.2	 It sits in your balance sheet and you just take these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1923.1s	1923.1	 Enormous swings and you're just like god you can't do anything around this stuff and that's not a viable financial market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1929.8s	1929.8	 That doesn't yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1931.4s	1931.4	 To be specific about what gensler said I just looked it up here, you know, he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1935.7s	1935.7	 compared
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1936.8s	1936.8	 utility tokens with you know launch remat tokens or tickets to the opera and he said entrepreneurs are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1942.6s	1942.6	 choosing to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1943.7s	1943.7	 Perceive their tokens as utility to sidestep regulation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1947.4s	1947.4	 And that here's the quote they are highly speculative investment tokens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1951.5s	1951.5	 For people who are trying to save or speculate for the future their future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1955.1s	1955.1	 And that's why I think it's appropriate to bring them inside the investor protection perimeter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1959.3s	1959.3	 I agree with him. I also agree with you chamath that this is a can of worms that I don't know how you put the gene
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1964.0s	1964.0	 But he's he's partially right. I mean he is partially right on some tokens, but he's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1969.0s	1969.0	 Completely accurate on some other tokens. I think it's on a case-by-case basis and it depends
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1973.8s	1973.8	 Listen, I think anybody who is buying these tokens right now knows that they're engaged and in financial speculation this idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1980.9s	1980.9	 That people in middle middle america are going to blow their retirement savings on crypto. I don't I just don't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1986.5s	1986.5	 But if they know if they're doing speculation, then it should be a security. No, no, no david. I think you're totally wrong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1990.6s	1990.6	 I totally buy it look at the quarterly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1993.8s	1993.8	 returns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=1995.4s	1995.4	 The filings of earnings from companies like robin hood and how much and square and how much money they make from crypto and look at their audience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2003.0s	2003.0	 That's totally not true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2004.1s	2004.1	 But don't you think that audience skews really young and they're getting their like covet stimulus check and they're yoloing it into meme stocks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2010.6s	2010.6	 Or crypto, what does that have to do with well because you're making it sound like they're going to blow their retirement savings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2015.4s	2015.4	 Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2015.7s	2015.7	 Well if you're talking about a 25 year old who's got five thousand dollars of retirement savings maybe but they still got you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2021.0s	2021.0	 They still got 40 years of work ahead of them. Hold on a second. Wait. No, they don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2025.0s	2025.0	 This is going to be the least hard-working generation of our lifetime. Why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2028.7s	2028.7	 No, no, no, not not because they're not hard-working. Why there's 70
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2032.9s	2032.9	 Trillion dollars that boomers have that they are about to pass down to these folks on average between two and three trillion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2040.6s	2040.6	 a year for the next 30 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2043.2s	2043.2	 Also, they know how to do gig work like they're so smart this generation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2046.7s	2046.7	 They don't have to do projects for five grand and float themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2049.4s	2049.4	 You're going to take one entire turn of the world's gdp
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2053.9s	2053.9	 And give it to a hundred million people in america over the next 20 to 30 years. That is what is actually going to happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2060.2s	2060.2	 So yeah, look I think I think of course they're going to keep yoloing this stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2064.2s	2064.2	 Yeah, look, I think I think we're going to get off on like a little bit of a tangent here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2067.6s	2067.6	 My point my point is not that there shouldn't be investor protections
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2072.0s	2072.0	 but rather that I think we also need to balance another important objective which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2077.4s	2077.4	 To create a hospitable environment for innovation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2081.3s	2081.3	 And the fact of the matter is that you've got a lot of brilliant young entrepreneurs computer scientists building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2087.9s	2087.9	 This financial infrastructure of the future with crypto. It's not just speculation. There is a lot of code being written. It has functionality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2095.0s	2095.0	 There's a purpose to it. We don't we don't necessarily want to interfere with that to to the point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2100.2s	2100.2	 Has to do their securities though david all the other startups that are not in crypto are playing by the rules
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2104.7s	2104.7	 So it's crypto people get a pass. It's unfair. I agree with jake hell people make this claim and I just think it's so specious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2111.4s	2111.4	 Do you think that you would have made a single professional decision in your life based on tax rate?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2116.6s	2116.6	 Have you ever made a single like i'm going to start this company. I'm going to make this product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2121.3s	2121.3	 You know, i'm going to change this job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2123.4s	2123.4	 I just think that most people i'm not talking about paying taxes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2126.0s	2126.0	 I think it was smart for for example salon to pay corporate taxes on their token sale
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2130.6s	2130.6	 I think everyone should pay their taxes. That's not what we're talking about here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2134.2s	2134.2	 And i'm not saying that gansler shouldn't prescribe regulations. I think that part of the purpose of those regulations should be to give
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2140.5s	2140.5	 Entrepreneurs predictability to be able to give them a safe harbor so they can build what they want to build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2145.0s	2145.0	 Let me make one final point. I'm just saying from my perspective. I just think that if you have clear sensible taxation, that's 90
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2152.2s	2152.2	 Of what this industry needs and I don't think it will it will change anybody's real motivation to work inside this ecosystem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2159.4s	2159.4	 I agree just like just like entrepreneurship doesn't change when capital rates capital gains
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2163.4s	2163.4	 Look, I i've paid i've paid taxes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2165.5s	2165.5	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2166.3s	2166.3	 At you know on on all my crypto sales like it was any other investments since the beginning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2171.5s	2171.5	 You know, that's not the issue. The issue is when you're a company and you're raising money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2174.9s	2174.9	 Should you be allowed to not follow securities law because you say it's a token friedberg?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2179.8s	2179.8	 When you look at this an nft company came out last this past week that was selling shadow shares in startups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2187.7s	2187.7	 And anyone in the world could buy a shadow share in a private company like stripe etc in this fantasy football league
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2195.1s	2195.1	 They wound up shutting it down or changing it because they didn't want to trade on other people's intellectual property
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2200.5s	2200.5	 They were concerned about that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2201.8s	2201.8	 But just looking at it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2203.8s	2203.8	 The public in america 96 of them who are not accredited cannot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2208.4s	2208.4	 Buy shares of stripe in the secondary market, but you can buy nfts in it and speculate on the nfts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2214.3s	2214.3	 Which are accelerating from you know, a thousand dollars to five hundred thousand dollars in these different clubs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2220.7s	2220.7	 How is it fair that crypto companies get to not obey basic securities laws?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2226.2s	2226.2	 Friedberg well, it's not a security. There's no underlying asset
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2229.8s	2229.8	 Okay, it's a collectible and nft is clearly a collectible jacob
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2233.5s	2233.5	 Uh, okay, and I don't have I don't have any legal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2236.1s	2236.1	 I don't have any legal ownership over stripes business and have a marketplace for people to sell them and they're appreciating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2240.6s	2240.6	 I mean I I do agree something different sounds like art to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2243.4s	2243.4	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2243.7s	2243.7	 You could go draw a piece of a picture of stripe and put it on a piece of paper and go down to downtown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2249.1s	2249.1	 Wherever and stand in front of the burrito shop and try to sell it to people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2252.1s	2252.1	 Different than a security but they're acting as securities in relation to the fundraising of these projects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2257.0s	2257.0	 So I think that's the challenge not everything is a security. Yeah, there's no security
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2261.5s	2261.5	 You don't have any secured interest. It's literally just a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2264.8s	2264.8	 Like an image a figure I was just offered a jacometti sculpture, but I turned it down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2270.3s	2270.3	 How much 60 million isn't going to comment on the price? Yeah, I had to say no was stephen cohen selling it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2276.1s	2276.1	 Not commenting on the seller. I bet stephen cohen was selling it. That was the record deal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2280.4s	2280.4	 Stephen cohen bought that jacometti sculpture a few years ago. It's like the highest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2284.4s	2284.4	 Price ever paid at auction for a piece of art in the u.s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2287.0s	2287.0	 Can I just tell you my problem with with it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2289.2s	2289.2	 I I took the price and I divided it by the height in centimeters and it just tilted me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2296.0s	2296.0	 Is price per square inch a metric in it is in my head
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2300.3s	2300.3	 Listen in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2302.3s	2302.3	 26 15 stephen cohen paid 141 million dollars for the jacometti sculpture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2308.1s	2308.1	 loam or dough or do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2311.5s	2311.5	 Pretty uh incredible and I think you're right. It's about 12 inches tall or something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2316.9s	2316.9	 That's what I want to let you know that if you look at the height it looks like it was done by a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2322.4s	2322.4	 12 year old. Oh my god. Stop jay cal jay cal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2326.2s	2326.2	 You're gonna stop yeah, this is the billionaire equivalent of uh of crypto and nfts, right totally totally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2333.2s	2333.2	 I don't know what's going on this guy's running but that looks like anyone can raise their hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2338.8s	2338.8	 And say I have an independent objective assessment of the value of anything in the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2344.6s	2344.6	 Um, and you can look at it from high to low and this is all um effectively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2349.5s	2349.5	 Looks like it was a beautiful sculpture. That was in a giant fire and that somebody pulled out of the ashes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2355.8s	2355.8	 It's a beautiful piece if you want to read a little bit of art history
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2359.2s	2359.2	 Yeah, you can understand a little bit about jacometti's work, but it's um, it's a 70 inch piece not 12 inches. Sorry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2365.4s	2365.4	 And um, yeah, his work is all about kind of like how do you capture the essence of the form?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2369.8s	2369.8	 Anyway, this is a super ridiculous tangent looks like somebody made something out of mud
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2377.5s	2377.5	 I have a very funny stevie cohen story. So this is like 10 years ago at art basel in miami
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2382.6s	2382.6	 And uh the day before the art fair opens it's called the furnissage people and so, uh, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2388.1s	2388.1	 Uh, it's like a day where you can go and see the the stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2391.7s	2391.7	 The day in advance and you can you know, kind of buy stuff or whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2395.0s	2395.0	 and uh, it's very funny it's kind of like, um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2398.6s	2398.6	 You know like when walmart does like a black friday thing like everybody lines up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2402.6s	2402.6	 And then they open the doors and we all run in and I was standing side by side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2405.8s	2405.8	 We were right at the front of the line and I noticed that he had these uh, and this is my first time there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2410.1s	2410.1	 He had new balance running shoes on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2412.9s	2412.9	 And I thought what is he doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2414.3s	2414.3	 But then when the doors went open they just took off and started running and I was walking wearing normal loafers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2420.1s	2420.1	 And then I realized I should have been wearing running shoes our own normal loafers. You were wearing italian loafers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2424.3s	2424.3	 Uh, I missed out on the balloon dog guy. It's like the it's like the running of the bulls
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2428.5s	2428.5	 I just thought it was it was the running of the bulls. I missed out on everything running of the billionaires
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2432.7s	2432.7	 I got to the things after and I was like, oh, sorry. I sold it to stevie cohen. I sold this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2436.6s	2436.6	 I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2439.3s	2439.3	 Had blisters on my feet. It was brutal. Do you guys know we haven't even started our agenda? No
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2448.0s	2448.0	 Fucking moderating this three two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2459.0s	2459.0	 I'm sure everybody by now has seen uh frances haugen, uh on 60 minutes and testifying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2465.5s	2465.5	 She seemed incredibly credible, uh well spoken and had very common
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2471.2s	2471.2	 Uh sense non-extreme views about what should be happen. What should happen with the research that facebook has been funding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2478.7s	2478.7	 That shows like other media forms, uh instagram and facebook have a really terrible effect on young people specifically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2486.3s	2486.3	 young girls and body dysmorphia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2489.1s	2489.1	 Which seems to be the one thing that is landing pretty well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2492.7s	2492.7	 Her suggestions were not to break up facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2495.5s	2495.5	 Hers was to have a regulatory body and to do soft interventions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2499.5s	2499.5	 If you don't know soft interventions her her suggestions were worse than breaking up facebook. Well soft interventions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2504.7s	2504.7	 Let's get to that include things like hey in order to retweet the story on twitter. You probably should read it first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2511.7s	2511.7	 She thinks she wants to reform or she's an advocate for reforming section 230 in relation. I think to the algorithms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2518.3s	2518.3	 Uh, and the idea here would be that the algorithms are making
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2521.8s	2521.8	 An actual editorial decision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2524.5s	2524.5	 Which is something that I remember in the youtube early days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2526.9s	2526.9	 They said we will not feature your videos that you're making but we will have the algorithm pick them because that keeps our safe harbor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2534.6s	2534.6	 zuckerberg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2536.2s	2536.2	 came back and wrote a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2539.0s	2539.0	 spirited defense, uh, basically saying why would we do this research if we didn't care the people at this company care a ton
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2547.4s	2547.4	 sax and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2549.9s	2549.9	 Uh entire peter teal cobble of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2554.3s	2554.3	 You know acolytes and friends are coming on strong as pro facebook i'll have him talk about that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2561.7s	2561.7	 He thinks it's a facebook. Uh, it's laughable that people are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2566.4s	2566.4	 Addicted to facebook yada. Yada
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2568.5s	2568.5	 So, uh, who wants to go first you tremoth or zacks? Well, look here. Let me let me say a couple things. I think that um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2575.6s	2575.6	 I think zucks the title of zucks, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2579.1s	2579.1	 Internal, uh company post could have been titled naa
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2583.7s	2583.7	 Which basically this was his way of saying that this is ridiculous and I don't believe it the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2589.9s	2589.9	 The thing that she asked for in substance is a little different than what the doj
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2596.7s	2596.7	 Did with microsoft in 2000 but in form is actually quite similar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2599.9s	2599.9	 Which basically is like gumming up how the internal product development would work inside the company and you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2605.8s	2605.8	 The most damaging thing you already saw which is that they had a bunch of planned product releases
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2611.5s	2611.5	 And then they put them on ice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2613.3s	2613.3	 And I think this is really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2615.9s	2615.9	 where unfortunately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2618.7s	2618.7	 The most damage gets done because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2621.8s	2621.8	 Engineers won't really tolerate that for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2625.5s	2625.5	 Some amount of time, right? They'll put up with it initially but you know, you've had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2630.3s	2630.3	 Uh, I don't know. I think like a 20 reduction in stock price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2633.5s	2633.5	 So you had you know, you lost 200 billion dollars of market cap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2637.7s	2637.7	 There's probably going to be more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2639.8s	2639.8	 turbulence in the company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2642.0s	2642.0	 You can sustain and get through all of it as long as the engineers hold the line
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2647.1s	2647.1	 But if you basically slow down and put a pin in their ability to generate code and to put out features
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2654.3s	2654.3	 On the margins enough people I think will get frustrated and leave and I think the way that she you know what she is asking for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2660.9s	2660.9	 Was tantamount to that and I think that's the really destructive part of um of what could go on here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2666.6s	2666.6	 So they need to get this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2668.8s	2668.8	 Pin down quickly get in front of regulators get some laws passed whether it's section 230 or whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2674.4s	2674.4	 That's the path to salvation for facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2677.0s	2677.0	 Sax what do you what do you think? I see you're basically saying this is like ridiculous and silly on twitter. Mike salana is saying that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2684.6s	2684.6	 Obviously peter teal is on the board of facebook and you're gonna have to you're gonna have to give me time to unpack this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2690.0s	2690.0	 Jake how about getting hysterical because there is there's a lot to go over here. I want i'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2693.9s	2693.9	 Literally throwing it to you in a non-historical way. You think that this is there's nothing to this first of all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2699.4s	2699.4	 Let's let's understand what this really was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2702.8s	2702.8	 Okay, you have this so-called whistleblower who?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2707.0s	2707.0	 Is working with the staff of the senate ministry committee giving documents to the wall street journal and then appears on 60 minutes in this great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2713.3s	2713.3	 Unveiling 36 hours later. She's testifying on capital hill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2717.7s	2717.7	 That does not happen the senate committees do not operate that fast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2721.4s	2721.4	 This was coordinated. She's got a democrat a well-known democratic operative named bill burton working for her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2726.3s	2726.3	 She's got a team of lawyers. She's got a pr team this coordinated by who this is a coordinated hit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2732.5s	2732.5	 Okay by anti-facebook forces starting with the senate judiciary committee
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2737.6s	2737.6	 Who want to regulate who?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2740.3s	2740.3	 She's working with the staff jake out and stop you're already interrupting jason. I'm asking you who you said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2744.8s	2744.8	 No, I know working with such a I don't know who it is. Just let him make this argument and then just stop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2748.9s	2748.9	 Let I want to hear what he has to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2751.2s	2751.2	 Okay, what is the purpose of this testimony? First of all, we can go over the details of what she said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2756.2s	2756.2	 I don't think there was anything new here. This was all the same arguments. We've been hearing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2760.3s	2760.3	 from these same sort of forces who want to regulate facebook whether it's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2764.7s	2764.7	 Whether it's the senators on the committee who've hauled up zuckerberg no fewer than four times to lecture him about the need for more censorship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2771.4s	2771.4	 Uh, or it's these forces of the media who basically want facebook. It's all about, you know having more censorship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2777.1s	2777.1	 Uh, but in any event, there was nothing really new there. Um, what this really was was corroboration and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2783.9s	2783.9	 Of of of the same talking points we've been hearing for years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2787.8s	2787.8	 And where and what it's all leading up to is there's a very important part of her testimony
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2793.3s	2793.3	 Which is this is really the crux of it is that they that she proposed and what blumenthal wants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2798.8s	2798.8	 He's the chairman of the senate judiciary committee is a dedicated oversight body. This is in this clip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2804.3s	2804.3	 Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2805.3s	2805.3	 With a power to oversee social media platforms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2807.5s	2807.5	 So what we have here is the government is now going to have a new agency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2812.3s	2812.3	 They're saying like the ftc then she said a regulatory home where somebody like me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2817.9s	2817.9	 could do a tour of duty after working at a place like this and and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2822.0s	2822.0	 Hogan said right now the only people in the world are trained to analyze these experiments to understand what's happening inside of facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2827.9s	2827.9	 Are people who grew up inside of facebook or pinterest or another social media company basically people with her experience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2833.9s	2833.9	 I mean, I have to admire the chutzpah. I mean, she's basically proposing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2837.9s	2837.9	 That she be made zuckerberg's boss
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2840.1s	2840.1	 Okay, that a new oversight board be created by the government which she would be appointed to which she presumably would run
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2847.2s	2847.2	 and this board is now going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2849.2s	2849.2	 Prescribe regulations and rules for social networks in terms of how their news feed is going to run
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2854.1s	2854.1	 That is what was proposed on capitol hill that is what this operation is all about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2858.7s	2858.7	 So it's about her getting a job and being uh lording over facebook is your claim
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2864.3s	2864.3	 No, I think I think I think the purpose of all this is to create new regulatory oversight of social networks. I simply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2871.0s	2871.0	 Would note that she has proposed herself as somebody who would be on this board, which is pretty amazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2876.7s	2876.7	 But what this is really about is that new oversight power?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2880.1s	2880.1	 And is that a republican or a dem are you insinuating it's democrats who want to regulate this or all politicians want to regulate this because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2887.1s	2887.1	 They're scared of facebook having too much power, which I think we all agree facebook has too much power
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2892.5s	2892.5	 In in the public you've had the leaders you've had the leaders on the senate judiciary committee now for months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2898.3s	2898.3	 Calling up zuckerberg and dorsi and other social media leaders and basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2902.4s	2902.4	 Lecturing them on the need to censor more to take down more material. That is their objective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2906.9s	2906.9	 This is not a conspiracy theory on my part. This is expressly what they've said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2911.5s	2911.5	 Okay now until now is it left or right or both?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2915.0s	2915.0	 Let me come to that. I think the republicans are a little bit confused on this issue, but let me get to that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2918.9s	2918.9	 so what you've heard until now is uh, is that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2923.6s	2923.6	 Is a tax on the supply side of the platform. So what they've advocated is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2928.2s	2928.2	 Deplatforming people with heterodox heterodox views dissenting voices and they have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2934.3s	2934.3	 Deplatformed in large numbers. Obviously it started even before trump but certainly the sitting president united states was deplatformed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2940.9s	2940.9	 YouTube just took down a million coveted videos because they disagree with official position on covet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2945.4s	2945.4	 So until now the censorship has been on the supply side of the platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2949.1s	2949.1	 What they're advocating for now is censorship on the demand side of the platform, which is we're going to rewrite these newsfeed rules
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2955.4s	2955.4	 Okay, we're going to rewrite them because we can't give people what they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2958.9s	2958.9	 What the they're making these algorithms sound like there are these incredibly evil sinister things all the algorithms do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2965.4s	2965.4	 At the end of the day is give the user more of what they're looking for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2968.8s	2968.8	 Okay, and that is that is not good enough for these politicians
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2972.5s	2972.5	 They want to rewrite those rules what they said they want to rewrite these rules to determine what people see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2977.3s	2977.3	 No, no what they said about the algorithms was that the algorithm had a multiplier on it and that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2983.1s	2983.1	 This multiplier of people resharing it re-engaging the content would lead people and this was statistically proven in facebook's own research
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2990.6s	2990.6	 That things that were either misinformation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2993.8s	2993.8	 Or that were supercharged, uh, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=2997.1s	2997.1	 Polarizing issues they would rise quicker which then gave people not what they wanted in their feed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3002.6s	3002.6	 They gave people what would increase the length of a stay on facebook or on youtube or on twitter for that matter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3008.5s	3008.5	 And they think the antidote for this is to maybe not allow things in the algorithm to go viral because what you're doing is saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3015.4s	3015.4	 things that are either misinformation or polarizing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3019.1s	3019.1	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3020.0s	3020.0	 Or will make things go to the top of the list and maybe we don't want that as a society
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3024.8s	3024.8	 let me intervene with a with a point of view on this because I think you're you're headed down a path that um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3031.6s	3031.6	 To me, I I don't think actually speaks to what's really going on. It sounds like there's some sinister
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3036.8s	3036.8	 Archa, you know architecture here that's driving this outcome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3042.1s	3042.1	 If you I never said that yeah, well, I mean it's implied because it's like oh well they're they're multiplying sinister stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3048.3s	3048.3	 What no i'm saying they're just care about length of stay on the site
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3051.3s	3051.3	 My belief is they just want to take care about revenue. Yes. That's my exactly my point shimma
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3055.5s	3055.5	 They care about what consumers want to consume and consumers demand what they want to consume
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3060.3s	3060.3	 So think about media in the old days, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3062.6s	3062.6	 We used to have books that an author would put out every year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3065.5s	3065.5	 And so the author would get feedback on the book and so it would be one year on that feedback cycle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3069.9s	3069.9	 Then magazines would come out magazines would come out every month
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3072.8s	3072.8	 And so every month the magazine would get feedback on what sales were and they would make decisions editorial decisions and they would iterate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3078.3s	3078.3	 TV shows came out every week newspapers came out every day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3081.9s	3081.9	 Cable tv came out every hour and they could adjust their content accordingly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3086.1s	3086.1	 In the internet age the media is getting a much more kind of instantaneous feedback cycle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3090.9s	3090.9	 And the call it publisher or editor or curator of that media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3095.9s	3095.9	 Ultimately ends up putting in front of the consumer more and more of what they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3099.8s	3099.8	 As a function of what they're choosing to watch and what we're calling kind of these algorithms quote-unquote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3105.3s	3105.3	 Are really just the same thing that editors and publishers and others have done in the past
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3109.3s	3109.3	 Which is looking at what the consumer votes by what they choose making decisions to put more of the things that they want in front of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3116.5s	3116.5	 The consumer consumes more of that and here's what's messed up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3119.5s	3119.5	 We're getting a very ugly look in the mirror
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3121.9s	3121.9	 And what humanity and what citizens and what individuals actually want to consume and choose to consume and get turned on by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3129.0s	3129.0	 And that is what's making this all so ugly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3131.1s	3131.1	 And when we see that we don't like to accept the fact that maybe that is just what humans are attracted to and what humans want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3137.1s	3137.1	 To consume at scale and we end up wanting to blame someone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3140.6s	3140.6	 And I could argue and I think others could argue that these algorithms that are effectively just recursive optimization functions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3146.6s	3146.6	 They're recursively trying to figure out what do people want to consume and then giving them more of what they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3151.0s	3151.0	 You keep saying solving for those very specific needs and use cases and I don't think that those algorithms are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3158.3s	3158.3	 Go ahead. Jermoth. Why is it not want I i'm interested in that unpacking it. No the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3164.1s	3164.1	 Everything Friedberg says is absolutely right, but it's not the word want it's not what they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3168.6s	3168.6	 It's what they will react to the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3171.3s	3171.3	 And sometimes what they react to the most subconsciously want I don't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3174.7s	3174.7	 But my point is that there's there's a I guess I don't I don't use facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3178.1s	3178.1	 But they went from thumbs up and thumbs down when I was there to like this nuance like there's likes there's tears. There's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3184.1s	3184.1	 angry re-shares
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3185.5s	3185.5	 But there's also analytics data on engagement right like on how long someone's watching a video or what I saw in there was that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3191.7s	3191.7	 There was an amplification of things that were more extreme emotional reactions, right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3197.1s	3197.1	 And and the point is that I think everything you said is absolutely right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3201.0s	3201.0	 The algorithms are amplifying I think all I would say is I would restate what you're saying is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3205.2s	3205.2	 These algorithms tend to amplify the things that are the most extreme and illicit a reaction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3210.2s	3210.2	 Yeah, those reactions aren't necessarily the things that you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3214.1s	3214.1	 Those are the things that you will react to the most and by the way algorithm wants to serve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3218.4s	3218.4	 That's why you see that the top 10 things that are reshared the most often tends to be very extreme
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3224.2s	3224.2	 right fundamental emotional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3226.2s	3226.2	 Responses are typically associated with things that I think we call hedonism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3231.3s	3231.3	 And the things that you can ignore your emotional responses and take another course of action. We typically call altruism or what have you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3238.6s	3238.6	 This is a uh kind of a common reason why people would want to watch a comedy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3242.7s	3242.7	 Or watch a horror film because there's some emotional response. It's not a universal response
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3247.0s	3247.0	 And people aren't rushing to the theater to watch documentaries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3249.9s	3249.9	 They're not rushing to the movie theater to be like, oh I want to be informed and educated on something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3253.5s	3253.5	 That's factual and interesting they want to go and have emotional experiences and that's how humans are biologically wired
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3259.4s	3259.4	 And the same is happening in these short forms of media these little tweets or these posts on facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3264.2s	3264.2	 You understand that they won't show murders and porn on facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3268.2s	3268.2	 So they're making an editorial decision to say hey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3270.8s	3270.8	 We're not going to include every night on the local news if it bleeds it leads that how long has that been the motto in media?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3277.7s	3277.7	 So i'm listening i'm listening to hoggan on 60 minutes. I'm hearing her describe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3282.6s	3282.6	 A corporate profit-making machine that tries to get more reach more ratings by fueling polarization and division
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3289.5s	3289.5	 And i'm thinking is she talking about cable news? That's what she's talking about. Isn't she is she talking about the new york times?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3295.8s	3295.8	 Is she talking about the traditional media because every single thing she said about how social media fuels polarization and division applies to the media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3303.4s	3303.4	 And yet those same voices in the traditional media are the first ones howling about facebook and calling for its regulation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3309.5s	3309.5	 It is completely hypocritical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3311.6s	3311.6	 Because the real purpose here is not to reduce divisiveness or polarization our society
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3317.8s	3317.8	 The regulation on facebook will not do that. It is to seize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3321.6s	3321.6	 control and influence over the machinery
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3324.9s	3324.9	 Of social networking why because the news feed now controls the flow of information in our society
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3331.5s	3331.5	 Don't you think the damage has been done though? Meaning in the sense that if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3335.5s	3335.5	 cripple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3337.0s	3337.0	 Facebook's product velocity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3340.0s	3340.0	 And you shrink the surface area
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3343.2s	3343.2	 Of the areas in which they can operate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3345.7s	3345.7	 Isn't that more damaging than any regulation? No people will just stop using it and then they will find another place to get that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3353.6s	3353.6	 I've already stopped using facebook. Okay, I don't find it compelling at all and i'm not really on instagram either
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3359.0s	3359.0	 I I do find twitter rather compelling and i'm probably more addicted to that than other things. Yeah exactly off the rails
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3366.1s	3366.1	 Probably not very good for me. Okay, but but here's the thing. I think I think all of us on this show right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3372.3s	3372.3	 None of us find facebook particularly addictive in our own behavior. Okay, I think we understand in our own behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3379.4s	3379.4	 That facebook is sort of like a mildly diverting amusement that occasionally yields
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3384.5s	3384.5	 Information sometimes it's useful. Okay, we understand that it's sort of like a news feed with a lot of noise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3389.7s	3389.7	 Okay in our own usage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3391.6s	3391.6	 But somehow we've bought into this larger narrative that in everybody else's usage that somehow this is a brainwashing machine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3399.4s	3399.4	 That is pumping people full of disinformation and warping their thinking in other words
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3403.1s	3403.1	 There's a sharp dichotomy between how we perceive our own usage and other people's usage and what I would submit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3409.6s	3409.6	 Is our own usage is what we know and what we know to be true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3413.8s	3413.8	 And what we believe about other people's usage is simply a narrative that's been fed to us over and over again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3420.0s	3420.0	 By the traditional media who hate facebook because it's disirmediating them. That is what's really going on here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3425.6s	3425.6	 You may be right. I'm saying something different which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3428.6s	3428.6	 Getting apart from all of that stuff. What's happening practically on the ground right now is that is a company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3434.8s	3434.8	 Who has to now slow way down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3437.6s	3437.6	 And what i'm saying is that's not dissimilar to what microsoft had to do which was there was this 10 year period at microsoft
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3442.7s	3442.7	 Where they really couldn't innovate and that's really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3446.4s	3446.4	 How the government solved the microsoft problem?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3449.8s	3449.8	 Yeah, they they made them less aggressive right they gummed up the internal machinery
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3454.2s	3454.2	 So that microsoft couldn't really be there for the next few major
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3458.3s	3458.3	 So for example that we just spent we just spent 40 minutes talking about crypto
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3462.0s	3462.0	 What do you think the chances are that you know facebook now can land a really compelling crypto project, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3467.8s	3467.8	 They got totally shut down with libra, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3469.8s	3469.8	 I mean they went after it and the regulators stepped in and it's too old for them to launch that after what happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3475.1s	3475.1	 It's it's zero, you know with their behavior in other arenas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3479.0s	3479.0	 I think that like microsoft back in the the late 90s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3482.9s	3482.9	 I think there are real and legitimate concerns about the power of these big tech companies about how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3488.7s	3488.7	 Power how big and powerful they've become about their ability to crush competitors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3492.3s	3492.3	 I think those are all legitimate and in a weird way if this government scrutiny slows those companies down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3497.8s	3497.8	 That's not an altogether bad thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3499.8s	3499.8	 But I am concerned about that i'd say separately just because these companies do deserve to be scrutinized more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3506.7s	3506.7	 I do think that we have to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3509.0s	3509.0	 That the people who are engaged in this really coordinated hit campaign against facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3514.8s	3514.8	 They have other they have another agenda and that is to control the flow of information online
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3519.9s	3519.9	 It is to control online discourse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3521.8s	3521.8	 It's already been happening over the past year with censorship on the supply side of the news feed and now they're trying to control the demand side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3528.6s	3528.6	 I think we have to be extremely wary about this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3530.6s	3530.6	 Well david isn't you you've been on the other side of this because on previous podcasts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3535.0s	3535.0	 You've talked about facebook being too influential having too many users
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3539.7s	3539.7	 And now you're saying well these tiny little news networks that get a couple of low millions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3544.8s	3544.8	 He has a he has an issue jason with the way in which they're going after facebook. Okay, I get that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3549.8s	3549.8	 He thinks it's a coordinated hit fine, but you also have had an issue with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3554.2s	3554.2	 Facebook having too much power
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3557.8s	3557.8	 To take somebody off the platform or to promote certain ideas. Yeah, so which is it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3562.7s	3562.7	 It seems like you're a little bit. Um, both can be true. No, it's perfectly it's it's no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3568.3s	3568.3	 It's perfectly consistent. I've expressed concerns about the way in which facebook is is deplatforming people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3574.2s	3574.2	 It's samara summarily silencing them and ghosting them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3578.3s	3578.3	 It's it's engaged in censorship. I've expressed concern about that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3581.1s	3581.1	 But we should understand that the people on the senate judiciary committee who hauled up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3585.1s	3585.1	 Who had this hearing who featured and spotlighted hoggan and turned her into this great hero
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3591.0s	3591.0	 Their agenda is even more censorship they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3594.8s	3594.8	 They are complaining about the fact that facebook is not censoring enough and that is what their real agenda is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3600.7s	3600.7	 I do think it should have been disclosed that hoggan does stand to gain financially from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3605.8s	3605.8	 Whatever happens, you know, I don't know that that's been confirmed that there is a whistleblower reward here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3611.7s	3611.7	 So we'll have to wait and see about that. I haven't heard there's no reward until there's a fine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3615.4s	3615.4	 But charlotte is right that she qualified if she's a whistleblower. She qualifies for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3620.2s	3620.2	 What a 30 percent portion of or some very large percentage of any fine be here though. What would the fine be?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3625.7s	3625.7	 How would that be framed chamath? This whole thing is just getting started
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3629.1s	3629.1	 They're going to be they're going to be just getting started and there will be settlements from those government actions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3633.6s	3633.6	 And the and facebook as you all know will pay any kind of fine to put this behind that you're the one that said jason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3640.6s	3640.6	 They spent five billion just so that they wouldn't subpoena
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3643.7s	3643.7	 Zuck and shiro, right? That's what you said last week. We talked about that last week. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3646.6s	3646.6	 So, I mean, I think there's a fine coming let's let's let's be honest. I I do not think lena con
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3651.9s	3651.9	 Uh or gary gansler or any of these other folks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3655.7s	3655.7	 Are going to be in the business of making a quick decision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3660.2s	3660.2	 Nor the doj nor any of these other folks they're going to want to really take their time to figure this out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3664.6s	3664.6	 But what i'm saying is it's not the ultimate result of it because I again I go back to like if you look at what happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3670.0s	3670.0	 in 2000 in microsoft
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3672.0s	3672.0	 the substance of what microsoft had to agree to was was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3676.5s	3676.5	 Ultimately not as bad as the way in which it was implemented
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3680.0s	3680.0	 Which is that you know, my understanding was like microsoft had to submit feature reviews to lawyers at the doj
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3686.5s	3686.5	 Who would then approve, you know updates and upgrades to their code base for things like windows?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3691.9s	3691.9	 That's what caused them to miss an entire wave of compute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3695.1s	3695.1	 And so this is the this is the point which is I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3698.1s	3698.1	 practically speaking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3700.3s	3700.3	 The beginning of what microsoft went through facebook is going to have to navigate and so the faster they can try
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3707.0s	3707.0	 To say all right folks. You're right. You caught us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3710.4s	3710.4	 Let's tell us what to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3711.5s	3711.5	 Maybe actually the the better path because it allows them to get past it because the longer this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3717.5s	3717.5	 This this period of like gray stretches out. I think is actually the worst outcome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3722.0s	3722.0	 Well, let's go through what we each think would be a possible solution here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3726.6s	3726.6	 To allowing free speech to occur on facebook, but maybe not having
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3732.1s	3732.1	 the things that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3733.7s	3733.7	 You know fake news, uh, you know misinformation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3737.6s	3737.6	 You know maybe lowering down the rhetoric
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3740.1s	3740.1	 And the charged nature of the algorithm freeburg. Do you have any common sense solution here that might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3746.2s	3746.2	 address both sides of the issue freedom of speech and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3750.0s	3750.0	 maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3751.0s	3751.0	 Things being amplified to 100 million people that are fake and just simply not true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3755.0s	3755.0	 We've talked a lot about this notion of like decentralized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3758.8s	3758.8	 social networks, I mean we haven't talked a lot we talked a little bit about it, but um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3763.4s	3763.4	 If you end up putting a regulatory hammer down on facebook and twitter and telling them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3769.7s	3769.7	 What consumers and remember these guys aren't media creators. They're platforms effectively for search discovery and access
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3777.1s	3777.1	 So you as an individual can discover third-party content on their platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3782.1s	3782.1	 If they start putting the regulatory hammer down on these quote unquote platforms telling them what they can and cannot make available to their users
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3788.7s	3788.7	 There will be another platform that will emerge and that platform may end up being in this kind of decentralized model
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3794.4s	3794.4	 And in that decentralized model, you're not going to have the same degree of regulatory oversight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3798.8s	3798.8	 And that system will end up solving the same use case eventually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3802.5s	3802.5	 Consumers will get what they want which is you know, what chamoff calls kind of this emotional response is eliciting this emotional reaction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3810.1s	3810.1	 They will consume it until they you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3812.7s	3812.7	 Achieve one of their kind of seven deadly sins objective, which is what's driving the emotion underscoring their decisions on what to watch what to consume
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3820.9s	3820.9	 And uh, and there will be an alternative so, you know, go ahead and play whack-a-mole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3824.9s	3824.9	 You'll play whack-a-mole for a few years maybe a few decades
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3827.7s	3827.7	 But at the end of the day digital technology in a connected world will drive consumers to exactly where they will naturally find themselves which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3835.4s	3835.4	 Consuming ever more of the things that create this emotional response in them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3839.6s	3839.6	 The consequences are unfortunate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3841.5s	3841.5	 um, you know, I don't know what the right solution is, you know, we've we've to some degree put a regulatory hammer down on things like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3848.5s	3848.5	 uh smoking and uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3850.8s	3850.8	 uh in some places things like sugar things that have kind of a you know, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3856.0s	3856.0	 An obvious effect on our physical health, uh, these other things that we're seeing now are having an effect on our mental health
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3862.8s	3862.8	 And I think that there may be kind of an emerging regulatory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3867.3s	3867.3	 regime around mental health standards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3869.7s	3869.7	 And how much of things can be consumed and I think what we're seeing is the leading indicator of this is what's gone on in china
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3875.7s	3875.7	 because china is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3877.1s	3877.1	 the nation that I would say is probably at the forefront of research and understanding of what the consequences are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3882.6s	3882.6	 Of consuming more or more of media and content that causes an emotional response to you and what happens down the road isolation loneliness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3890.5s	3890.5	 Suicide rates go up unhappiness, etc. It certainly is the consequence, but it's not a function of any individual company's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3897.5s	3897.5	 Um, misconveyance of content to consumers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3900.8s	3900.8	 It's just a function of where these systems end up going because of the way humans are biologically wired
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3907.3s	3907.3	 And so I guess my my first concern is maybe we end up in a decentralized system that ends up replacing all of these tools
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3912.7s	3912.7	 And this just doesn't end or you end up worse or it could be worse or you end up having these kind of regulatory regimes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3918.5s	3918.5	 Emerge no, it'll be that would be better a decentralized solution is actually no better in one. No, it's better in one key way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3925.3s	3925.3	 Which is that it's fundamentally harder to create the exact same network effect and density
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3931.3s	3931.3	 That you can have with one monolithic closed system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3934.1s	3934.1	 So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3934.9s	3934.9	 You're much more likely to actually have a very fragmented ecosystem of hundreds of different solutions depending on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3941.6s	3941.6	 What of the sins you want to feed or you know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3943.9s	3943.9	 What of the feelings you want to feel at any one time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3946.3s	3946.3	 I think it's a big assumption that it would be a fragmented network if you did replicate facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3951.3s	3951.3	 On a decentralized platform and then some piece of misinformation came out and it trended all the way to number one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3957.3s	3957.3	 Like say the january 6th insurrection and no no, you know, there's not gonna be guns to that. There's not one network
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3962.4s	3962.4	 There's not one that but if one now hold on hold on let me finish my point if the if one network became so large
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3967.7s	3967.7	 And there was nobody who could turn off something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3970.1s	3970.1	 What if people said hey, there's a riot going on at the capital and more people showed up with more guns, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3975.6s	3975.6	 You have nobody to sit there and say hey, don't go to the capital turn those trending posts off. Go ahead sacks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3980.7s	3980.7	 Okay, so let's let's talk about this problem of misinformation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3983.6s	3983.6	 Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3984.2s	3984.2	 I think there's an old mark twain quote saying that the ally can travel around the world faster than the truth can put on its shoes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3991.6s	3991.6	 Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3993.1s	3993.1	 There is a problem of falsehood spreading online. I agree with you there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=3997.1s	3997.1	 The question is what you do about it and the problem we have right now is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4002.9s	4002.9	 Is that truth is in that eye of the beholder? There is no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4006.8s	4006.8	 Truth api and so at the end of the day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4009.0s	4009.0	 It's the people in power who get to decide what is true and what is false if you give them the power to censor misinformation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4016.1s	4016.1	 Example we just saw we talked about in this program the rolling stone ivermectin hoax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4020.7s	4020.7	 Provingly false story and yet rachel mattoll still had it up on her post
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4025.1s	4025.1	 She was not sanctioned by msnbc twitter never told her to take it down and she was not fact-checked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4030.4s	4030.4	 However, the hunter biden laptop scandal or story which came out in the new york post a couple weeks before the election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4036.4s	4036.4	 Turned out to be a provably true story and yet it was taken down by facebook and twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4041.1s	4041.1	 At the end of the day this term of misinformation is just another vector
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4045.6s	4045.6	 For partisan attack and it will be used by whoever we give the power to to decide what misinformation is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4051.8s	4051.8	 So what is the answer then to this point of falsehood spreading online?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4056.2s	4056.2	 Well at the end of the day the answer to bad speech is more speech you try to create a free marketplace of ideas to let
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4063.9s	4063.9	 To let the good speech ultimately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4067.4s	4067.4	 Drive out the best feature prove that it's wrong. That's the best you can do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4071.0s	4071.0	 That's the best you can do in a free society. Yes, but we've this is the first time a free society has had social networks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4077.8s	4077.8	 That can reach a billion people instantly in you know an hour
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4081.6s	4081.6	 So I think there's one differentiator there that we must think of if somebody defames you on a social network
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4087.0s	4087.0	 They are absolutely liable. I mean you can sue them. Okay, but I think and you should and I think we can we've talked about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4092.6s	4092.6	 Cancel culture people are destroyed before they even get their day in court
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4096.7s	4096.7	 I think I think that's being destroyed for something different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4098.8s	4098.8	 I think if somebody but it's because it trends if it didn't if it couldn't trend to so many people it wouldn't leave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4103.7s	4103.7	 Lead to the cancellation and destruction of somebody's life. You've talked about that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4107.8s	4107.8	 Many times yourself if if somebody libel's you I think they should be you should be able to sue them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4112.6s	4112.6	 And I think we could actually we could have a libel regime more like the uk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4116.9s	4116.9	 Where it's easier to prove these cases in court and people are much more careful about defaming other people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4122.3s	4122.3	 I would be very much in favor of that. Okay, because defamation is not free speech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4126.7s	4126.7	 But the question really is about really we're talking about non-defamatory statements that somebody in a position of power has decided
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4133.8s	4133.8	 Is not true. Many of these statements are subjective. Dave Portnoy got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4138.1s	4138.1	 Labeled for his subjective opinion about aoc's dress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4141.9s	4141.9	 Why did that happen and why is that kind of labeling only used to protect one side of the political spectrum?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4147.4s	4147.4	 So, I mean that that that's what's really going on here. Let's end with this. Has anybody watched chapelle's the closer?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4153.5s	4153.5	 I did incredible. I I watched it pretty incredible. I mean fearless
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4159.1s	4159.1	 Fearless is a word. I was really um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4162.8s	4162.8	 I think that he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4165.5s	4165.5	 Slightly missed it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4167.7s	4167.7	 Because I think he could have really actually called out cancel culture and wokeism more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4172.2s	4172.2	 I think he kind of left it a little bit to me where I was like a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4176.3s	4176.3	 I don't know. I just I just didn't think they were as good as his other ones and I felt like he didn't really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4181.1s	4181.1	 Make the point he wanted to make it was a little convoluted somebody who can actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4186.2s	4186.2	 Stand up and and and actually set, you know be more satirical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4190.4s	4190.4	 And tell the story of why all this cancel culture and defamatory statements and judging people doesn't make sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4196.3s	4196.3	 But then he seemed he didn't he didn't get the job done. I felt like well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4200.0s	4200.0	 Let me ask you this about the performance. Did he seem qualitatively different than you in that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4204.2s	4204.2	 The other times he seemed very light on his feet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4206.6s	4206.6	 You know having a good time being a comedian and this time it felt like he was personally hurt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4211.8s	4211.8	 Or he was it wasn't comedy. It was less it felt less comedic. I agree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4215.4s	4215.4	 It felt like he had an agenda. He was hurt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4218.4s	4218.4	 He wanted to get some stuff off his chest and there were some jokes in between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4222.4s	4222.4	 Which is very different like the percentage of jokes in this is like 20 percent and the like heavy on max max
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4228.6s	4228.6	 and then the other ones were 80 percent jokes 20 social commentary this felt like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4233.0s	4233.0	 he um, he was actually really hurt and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4235.9s	4235.9	 Like I don't want to say bitter but just fed up maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4239.3s	4239.3	 Frustrated he had a chip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4241.8s	4241.8	 Which made it interesting to me, you know in the in the early 2000s chapelle for me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4247.2s	4247.2	 Was really important because he was an advocate for minorities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4251.3s	4251.3	 And I felt seen and protected by chapelle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4255.0s	4255.0	 and uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4256.7s	4256.7	 And I thought that was really important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4259.4s	4259.4	 And then his his comedy was just so sharp
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4262.8s	4262.8	 Oh, yeah, and I said I just think that it was a little bit of an opportunity lost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4267.4s	4267.4	 Yeah, I I think if he had really actually taken the you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4271.8s	4271.8	 It to its conclusion. He would have actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4275.4s	4275.4	 There was just too many uncomfortable moments in that thing. It was super uncomfortable at times and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4282.9s	4282.9	 I you know, I really would like to see it again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4286.0s	4286.0	 Because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4287.0s	4287.0	 You know if you just think about his career, you know him talking about police brutality him talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4292.4s	4292.4	 Race in a very fearless
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4294.8s	4294.8	 You know entertaining but also informative way and and just being a truth-teller
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4298.7s	4298.7	 Yeah, this was a so uncomfortable at times. I agree with that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4302.9s	4302.9	 I need to watch it again and I need to let it sit because I was taking it's on netflix
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4307.3s	4307.3	 It's the last in his contract. Yeah, I mean this could be I almost felt like he was trying to break netflix because he does seem to have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4315.4s	4315.4	 He does seem to have a streak in him where he's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4318.0s	4318.0	 Okay, i'm gonna i'm walking away from comedy central and he does seem to burn the boats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4321.9s	4321.9	 This felt like he was burning the boats with netflix to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4324.0s	4324.0	 I don't know if you got that vibe where he was like, this is the last one i'm being canceled after this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4328.5s	4328.5	 Fuck y'all i'm out. Um, and he has that I mean he torched it sax. I mean you're gonna watch this thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4334.0s	4334.0	 Oh now i'm definitely watching it. I i haven't seen it yet, but i'm definitely watching i'll watch it tonight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4338.6s	4338.6	 I give it a 50 chance that netflix takes it down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4342.6s	4342.6	 Well, let's watch it quickly. Well, there were there was everybody was screaming for him to be deplatformed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4347.4s	4347.4	 Everybody was screaming. Well, then I like it even more, you know, one of the ironic things about these warning labels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4352.4s	4352.4	 I've noticed they've sort of become a badge of honor where you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4356.1s	4356.1	 if the if the hall monitors a twitter are trying to label your tweet as as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4361.6s	4361.6	 You know being incendiary, maybe it's just interesting right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4365.4s	4365.4	 Buy buy signal. It's a yeah exactly. So, you know, um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4370.1s	4370.1	 I was listening to uh, Antonio García Martínez interview, uh camille on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4375.7s	4375.7	 On call in and they they labeled that I mean just the post about they were going to have a conversation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4381.4s	4381.4	 You're saying the link to it was even flagged as like oh my lord
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4384.6s	4384.6	 I think there needs to be a netflix for a comedy where it's only subscription and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4391.0s	4391.0	 It's owned by the comedians like if dave chapelle were to create his own netflix
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4395.3s	4395.3	 I think it gets 10 million paid subscribers overnight first two years overnight now overnight overnight. Okay, so wait a second
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4401.8s	4401.8	 How do we wet our beaks on this if we go to chapelle and we say hey listen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4404.9s	4404.9	 Here's 25 million dollars. We'll set up the tech team. I'll set up the comedians. I'll ask k-heart. I'll ask them this weekend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4411.1s	4411.1	 I think that yeah, you get k-heart you get chapelle you get seinfeld you get um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4415.8s	4415.8	 Now do you get louis louis ck in there or ck? What's his name? I never found that guy funny
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4420.9s	4420.9	 That guy never did it for me. Well, I mean anyway, you know, it's funny. You know, it's funny
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4425.0s	4425.0	 Have you ever had this asian guy ronnie cheng?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4428.1s	4428.1	 He's on uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4429.7s	4429.7	 There's a great netflix special on him. He's fucking funny and then joe koi joe koi is very funny
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4435.2s	4435.2	 Yeah, I think ronnie cheng taped his own special hasan minhaj. That guy's very funny. He's great. He's legit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4441.4s	4441.4	 but I mean I this would be a great way for them to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4445.3s	4445.3	 Just control their destiny and not have to worry about cancel culture because I think a lot of the folks who are on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4450.2s	4450.2	 well, they are probably the the last line of people that actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4455.4s	4455.4	 Will be the defenders of free speech. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4457.4s	4457.4	 It's pretty scary as much as I think facebook should be more thoughtful about their algorithm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4463.6s	4463.6	 Uh, you know back to you know circling netflix and censorship back to the facebook issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4469.0s	4469.0	 I just think facebook should say hey listen, we've throttled the algorithm so that any one piece of content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4475.0s	4475.0	 Can only reach this many people over this period of time and yeah, sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4479.1s	4479.1	 That's going to lower our time on site or whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4481.3s	4481.3	 But we want things to have a little bit of time to spread and get fact-checked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4485.3s	4485.3	 Does anybody think that that's a good idea to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4488.3s	4488.3	 Just you know if you're trying to cancel somebody instead of it going to number one on trending topics before the person has a trial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4493.7s	4493.7	 That the algorithm would just take a little bit of time to propagate content. Here's what I can tell you conclusively if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4500.0s	4500.0	 facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4501.5s	4501.5	 Wanted to solve these issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4504.0s	4504.0	 In the ways that the government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4506.7s	4506.7	 expects in their head for these problems to be solved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4508.7s	4508.7	 Well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4510.7s	4510.7	 Facebook market cap would be 250 billion dollars and they'd have a million people working there at the company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4516.3s	4516.3	 So this is not an issue of whether it's possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4519.0s	4519.0	 The question is is it right and does it actually get at the solution or does it just as friedberg said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4524.2s	4524.2	 Create whack-a-mole someplace else and so, you know, I don't know what obliterating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4528.9s	4528.9	 Three-quarters of a trillion dollars of market cap will do but I suspect that the government is going to want to find out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4535.9s	4535.9	 Sax you think that throttling the the velocity of the algorithm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4539.9s	4539.9	 So that news doesn't spread as fast and violent or which could be misinformation could be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4545.4s	4545.4	 Valid information. Do you think that's a possible solution? Look, I I think that at the end of the day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4550.4s	4550.4	 With or disclosing the algorithm maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4552.9s	4552.9	 With both facebook and twitter you only see stuff from people who you're following or your friends with it's actually not true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4560.5s	4560.5	 What do you mean if things they will insert stuff into your twitter algorithm now that's adjacent to you and facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4567.0s	4567.0	 Will do that. Well, maybe maybe if people respond to someone who you're following
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4570.4s	4570.4	 But i've never seen anything my twitter feed other than an ad that's not from somebody I follow. So you never went to trending topics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4577.3s	4577.3	 No, I mean not my feed the explorer feed. Oh, okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4579.9s	4579.9	 No, but you the explorer feeds right there and they are surfacing things in your feed now that are not people you follow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4585.0s	4585.0	 But anyway, what they're really doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4586.8s	4586.8	 Okay, is there's a universe of people who you're following or your friends with and you could just see all of that content in a reverse chronological feed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4594.9s	4594.9	 But that would be too much. It'd be overwhelming. That's how it originally worked. Yeah, exactly and I get it and that was fine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4599.9s	4599.9	 I didn't I liked it. Okay, but as you're following thousands of people now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4604.3s	4604.3	 There's too much content and so they will simply surface the tweets that you're most likely to want to interact with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4610.3s	4610.3	 I don't believe by the way that those tweets are necessarily the ones that make you angry. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4616.9s	4616.9	 I think for some people it is clearly but it's not certainly not the case in my case what I would say is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4621.9s	4621.9	 It's more refined than that. It's the tweets that you think are interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4625.4s	4625.4	 It's the tweets that perhaps express a sense of outrage that agrees with your sense of outrage. It's a little different than anger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4633.1s	4633.1	 But it's it's basically the subset of content that you through your reveal preferences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4638.8s	4638.8	 Have have shown facebook or twitter that you know that you care about the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4643.4s	4643.4	 And that's basically what they're doing they're giving the consumer more of what they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4647.2s	4647.2	 And I think that we've blown this thing so far out proportion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4650.7s	4650.7	 I mean, yeah, there's an analogy that it's addictive, but I think that it's been blown so far out proportion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4657.1s	4657.1	 We've exaggerated the fear beyond any reasonable recognition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4662.3s	4662.3	 By the way, I think the I think the reason that that tweet was flagged i'm guessing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4666.8s	4666.8	 Is that in the tweet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4669.0s	4669.0	 Camellia says he's going to talk about critical race theory and that may be why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4674.0s	4674.0	 Twitter said it was linking to the all right. This conversations like this can be intense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4678.9s	4678.9	 That's all I think because he says the gloves are coming off. It looks like two people fighting or whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4682.6s	4682.6	 I just think it's sort of ridiculous. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4685.5s	4685.5	 You know like this is where like the warning label circle. Yes, it's a little condescending like patronizing this content patronizing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4691.8s	4691.8	 I think so patronizing. Yeah, I'm circling. Yeah, I got the thesaurus up here. I'm not dumb
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4699.1s	4699.1	 You know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBWhLr6Rro&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=85&t=4701.5s	4701.5	 It's a very palindromic look down for me
