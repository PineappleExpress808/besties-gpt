https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=0.0s	0.0	 Guys, my fucking dog, joker's in jail. Joker got in jail again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4.2s	4.2	 Okay, so he's been jailed in Italy. He was jailed in Palo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=8.0s	8.0	 Alto. When will that dog learn? I've spent quality control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=11.8s	11.8	 jailed because he's a runner. He went to he's a runner. He's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=15.0s	15.0	 runner. He's a truck stop. He the the we we we sent him to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=19.4s	19.4	 like a, you know, like the dog walker where he goes and runs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=22.6s	22.6	 around. And they come pick him up. But then the guy opened the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=26.2s	26.2	 van door. Anyways, he gets found. They're trying to call me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=33.2s	33.2	 Because I guess my number is on the thing which I hadn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=35.8s	35.8	 realized. You don't pick up can't reach me. Well, I'm in DC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=40.1s	40.1	 and New York. And they put them in the kennel and we get this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=44.0s	44.0	 picture and Nick you can post the picture but you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=46.1s	46.1	 because I said to do poor poor joker and dog Joe is a great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=49.1s	49.1	 dog. The but he is he is back. We got him back. But he's back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=54.1s	54.1	 He's out of jail again. Honestly, he's only going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=55.8s	55.8	 learn if he goes to jail. You should get a little tag for him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=58.0s	58.0	 those little remote tracking. That's not I mean, it's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=61.4s	61.4	 But it doesn't stop him from escaping that dog. There's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=64.0s	64.0	 something wrong with that dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=73.3s	73.3	 Only dog that doesn't like me. Every other dog every other dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=77.7s	77.7	 was trained in. No, he's not trained. He's not been trained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=81.5s	81.5	 We have to train him. I mean, I get it. He has been trained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=84.2s	84.2	 But he's so cute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=85.0s	85.0	 Did you train that dog to hate white people?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=91.4s	91.4	 That dog is a little racist. I'll say it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=93.1s	93.1	 Let your winter slide. Rainman David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=110.3s	110.3	 Alright, everybody, welcome to another episode of all in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=113.9s	113.9	 podcast that you've been listening to for 48 episodes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=117.5s	117.5	 Here we are on the precipice of greatness 49 episodes in with us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=122.5s	122.5	 again today, the queen of kinwa, your science ambassador,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=126.8s	126.8	 David Friedberg, also on the pod, the rain man himself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=131.9s	131.9	 Definitely his dad lets him drive in the driveway, David
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=135.3s	135.3	 Sachs and batting cleanup, the dictator himself to mouth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=140.0s	140.0	 polyhapity. What did we all think of last week's pod with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=145.2s	145.2	 biology?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=146.8s	146.8	 I felt they got cut off too soon. I was getting into a groove
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=149.6s	149.6	 with biology. And I'm trying to figure out how to pick that up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=152.0s	152.0	 with him because I thought they were getting into some pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=153.6s	153.6	 interesting discussion towards the end. And we obviously ran out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=157.0s	157.0	 of time to mouth had to hop off. So it would have been great to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=161.0s	161.0	 keep that conversation going with biology. I really do think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=163.6s	163.6	 there's a big question mark on like, how does the decent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=167.0s	167.0	 centralized web or decentralized social networks in particular
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=170.0s	170.0	 work with respect to kind of that, you know, recommendation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=173.4s	173.4	 application layer, which is effectively what search solved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=176.2s	176.2	 on the internet. And so I'm curious to keep the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=179.3s	179.3	 conversation going and seeing, you know, what this means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=181.8s	181.8	 I made the decision to end the pod because Chamath had to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=185.0s	185.0	 Sachs had to go there was a hard stop. And I was like, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=189.0s	189.0	 want to keep this going without the other besties. And people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=192.2s	192.2	 were very upset. They thought I shut it down abruptly. But we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=195.6s	195.6	 had a certain amount of time and we can always have them back so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=197.4s	197.4	 everybody relax. But I did look at the stats. We each came in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=200.9s	200.9	 with our you know, whatever percent pro rata and he had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=203.8s	203.8	 double so he had 40% and we all had base. Which is right for a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=206.8s	206.8	 guest, I think. I felt right. Didn't it feel right? I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=209.6s	209.6	 it's important to hear what when folks come on, what they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=212.6s	212.6	 have to say. He's a really smart guy. And, you know, you can kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=218.1s	218.1	 of just let him go and riff for a while. And then just react to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=222.1s	222.1	 him. So I think it's, it's lovely to hear such a deep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=224.9s	224.9	 thinker. Think out loud, quite honestly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=228.4s	228.4	 Yeah. And even if you don't agree with him, I don't agree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=230.6s	230.6	 with him on a lot of his points about, you know, decentralized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=233.2s	233.2	 everything. I think centralized works for, you know, many things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=235.9s	235.9	 better. I'm curious, Sachs, you know, looking back on it, were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=240.2s	240.2	 there moments that you felt maybe you disagreed with him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=242.7s	242.7	 more or agree with him more and wanted to lean into a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=244.8s	244.8	 conversation? Obviously, it's very hard to have five people on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=246.7s	246.7	 a pod and only get a certain amount of air time, etc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=250.2s	250.2	 Well, look, I think, I think biology is a great guest to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=253.9s	253.9	 on once in a while. I mean, it does kind of turn the pod a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=257.7s	257.7	 little bit more into a TED talk. Definitely have that vibe. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=261.9s	261.9	 the fans liked it. And I mean, biology should have his own show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=265.9s	265.9	 I mean, he can go for a while. I mean, he's got to say for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=269.0s	269.0	 hours. Yes. And he has. He has. And I think he should do his own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=272.9s	272.9	 show, because there's definitely a huge fan base for it. And, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=276.5s	276.5	 if people want more biology, I interviewed him for about an hour
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=279.8s	279.8	 on purple pills, which is kind of the, the, I don't know if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=284.1s	284.1	 want to call solo pod solo show that I do where I occasionally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=286.6s	286.6	 interview people on calling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=287.7s	287.7	 download call in and go check out purple pills. So yeah, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=293.3s	293.3	 know, I gave biology a little pep talk coming in saying, Hey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=297.2s	297.2	 listen, it's a roundtable discussion. And I've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=299.6s	299.6	 interviewed before and you can kind of tip into the monologuing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=302.9s	302.9	 and explaining very big picture things. So just try to pass the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=306.2s	306.2	 ball a little bit here. And I think he did adjust his game a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=309.8s	309.8	 little bit. But it's, you know, it's hard to have somebody like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=312.8s	312.8	 that on I think you pointed out sex that it's more like a TED
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=315.5s	315.5	 talk for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=316.1s	316.1	 We're having a conversation and he's used to being interviewed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=319.2s	319.2	 And I think that is that that's a transition. But, you know, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=322.6s	322.6	 was fine. Let's move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=323.8s	323.8	 Yeah, okay. So I think we'll start off with something we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=327.7s	327.7	 talked about on Episode nine, which was Coinbase, the CEO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=332.1s	332.1	 Brian Armstrong wrote a very controversial blog, very, very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=335.3s	335.3	 controversial blog post. Exactly a year ago, Coinbase is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=339.2s	339.2	 mission focused company at the time he was dealing with a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=343.3s	343.3	 never ending debate inside his own company about Black Lives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=347.2s	347.2	 Matter about social justice and any number of issues. And he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=350.1s	350.1	 said, Listen, the company is mission focused, our mission is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=353.7s	353.7	 to, you know, make people more financially independent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=356.9s	356.9	 literate, etc. And we're going to ban any discussions on our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=361.4s	361.4	 electronic communications, you can do things on your own time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=364.2s	364.2	 And it was quite controversial at the time we had a good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=366.0s	366.0	 discussion, I relistened to our discuss I relistened to our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=369.2s	369.2	 discussion on that pod. And we all universally felt like it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=372.6s	372.6	 the right move. Well, he went ahead and picked up the horn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=376.7s	376.7	 its nest, he did not have to talk about this ever again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=380.1s	380.1	 Everybody had forgotten about it. And he grabbed the horn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=382.5s	382.5	 its nest ran into the end zone and spiked it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=384.8s	384.8	 Jason, can you well before you do that, can you say how many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=388.8s	388.8	 people left as a result of his blog post? And all do you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=391.6s	391.6	 those stats? Because I think I don't have those stats. But it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=394.2s	394.2	 was, it was 5% ended up leaving, there was a big article about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=398.6s	398.6	 it. This was I think I think it was worth him doing a follow up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=403.1s	403.1	 post. This was the one year anniversary of his blog post.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=405.3s	405.3	 And he was kind of giving us a status update. And what he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=408.0s	408.0	 basically said is that the policy had worked. So you got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=411.7s	411.7	 them. So first of all, should we just review what the policy was?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=415.0s	415.0	 The policy was that they were going to declare the workplace
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=418.6s	418.6	 to be politically neutral that people would leave their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=422.0s	422.0	 politics to the door, they would not have sort of extraneous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=425.9s	425.9	 political conversations that work. That doesn't mean you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=429.2s	429.2	 couldn't support whatever causes you wanted on your own time or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=432.3s	432.3	 tweet whatever you want on your own time. But while you're at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=434.6s	434.6	 work, they would declare it to be sort of a political DMZ, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=438.7s	438.7	 a demilitarized zone. Basically, all he was doing was re
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=441.9s	441.9	 asserting the old center, the old etiquette of hey, when you go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=446.2s	446.2	 to work, you you're not engaged in your paid to work. You're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=450.6s	450.6	 there to engage in political activism. So that was the policy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=455.4s	455.4	 and of course, the woke mob became completely hysterical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=459.5s	459.5	 about it as it turns. And so then what happened is that Brian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=463.9s	463.9	 offered everyone a very generous severance policy if they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=466.7s	466.7	 didn't want to stick around. Yes, extremely generous. They made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=470.3s	470.3	 it really, really generous, right? They made it really easy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=473.3s	473.3	 for people to check out if they want to check out. Well, only 5%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=476.1s	476.1	 took the policy. Yes. And then on the heels of that there was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=479.7s	479.7	 gigantic New York Times hit piece against the company, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=482.6s	482.6	 usual disinformation and slanders against the company. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=487.7s	487.7	 then now we have this follow up piece. And I think what Brian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=490.3s	490.3	 basically reported is that today Coinbase is a more aligned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=494.0s	494.0	 company, because everyone who's there wants to be there for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=496.6s	496.6	 mission. That's what they focus on when they go to work. He
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=499.6s	499.6	 talked about how they had hired top talent away from other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=502.2s	502.2	 companies. I mean, basically, he put out the bat signal, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=505.6s	505.6	 people came running because you know, we have they wanted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=508.5s	508.5	 neutrality. They did not want to people are voting with their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=511.7s	511.7	 feet to come. Yeah, they're fed up with the politics and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=513.8s	513.8	 distraction. And and I think the employees were secretly relieved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=518.0s	518.0	 that he declared this policy. Basically, he took the heat on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=521.3s	521.3	 himself for the larger benefit of all the employees who just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=524.6s	524.6	 wanted to be there and work and not have to wonder whether
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=527.6s	527.6	 they're doing something right or wrong, because they're on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=530.0s	530.0	 wrong side of a political issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=531.2s	531.2	 Freberg nailed it when he said in our episode nine, which you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=534.9s	534.9	 go back to Freberg, you may not remember your comments, but you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=537.0s	537.0	 said, what about the employees who just want to come to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=540.6s	540.6	 and don't want to engage in political space? Now you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=542.6s	542.6	 infringing on them to force them to be participate in these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=545.4s	545.4	 discussions. And they don't have a choice because they need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=547.6s	547.6	 feed their families need to go to work. And so free break, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=549.8s	549.8	 think you take a little victory lap there. He says in this tweet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=552.7s	552.7	 storm, I'll just read the third part of it. One of the biggest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=555.2s	555.2	 concerns around our stance was that it would impact our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=557.2s	557.2	 diversity numbers. Since my post, we've grown our headcount
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=560.3s	560.3	 about 110%. doubled it, while our diversity numbers have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=564.1s	564.1	 remained the same or even improved in some metrics. So all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=566.8s	566.8	 of the hand wringing and pearl clutching that this would have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=570.5s	570.5	 negative effect on the company has turned out to be wrong. Go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=573.6s	573.6	 ahead, Chamath and then free bird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=575.7s	575.7	 I mean, if you want it like, I think it's important to set the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=578.2s	578.2	 context for what this is, there is a productivity war going on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=583.6s	583.6	 inside of institutions around the world. And what's happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=588.6s	588.6	 is that people's personal beliefs are bumping up against
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=592.4s	592.4	 what the mission and goals operational goals of a company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=597.8s	597.8	 are or a university or all these other places. And so this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=601.8s	601.8	 probably the first big example. This is a what is a 50 $60
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=605.1s	605.1	 billion public company, $50 billion public company that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=609.7s	609.7	 basically said enough's enough. This is our mission, everybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=613.3s	613.3	 else basically just needs to shut the fuck up. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=616.9s	616.9	 that that's very important. Now, if they then go off and actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=620.4s	620.4	 crush their goals, that's the one missing piece in all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=623.7s	623.7	 this. Because when that happens, then you can write a through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=627.3s	627.3	 line through all of this and say, okay, this is in part what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=630.4s	630.4	 allowed them to do it. So I think that the the the folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=635.3s	635.3	 that you know, were really up in arms, still have one small straw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=641.8s	641.8	 in the fight, which is that if these guys don't achieve their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=645.0s	645.0	 goals, they'll point to this as one of the reasons why. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=648.6s	648.6	 he hold diversity of strength, or you know, like, yeah, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=652.0s	652.0	 suppressing free speech, you know, that argument. But I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=656.0s	656.0	 if Brian then goes and delivers a couple of knockout quarters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=659.2s	659.2	 and a couple of knockout years, then you know, what he will be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=663.0s	663.0	 able to say definitively, which no one can refute is, we leave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=666.3s	666.3	 our politics at the door, we define our OKRs. And then we go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=669.2s	669.2	 and we build things that people need as a company. And then you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=673.6s	673.6	 go off and you can do what everyone and I think that that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=676.4s	676.4	 very powerful for many companies and institutions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=679.6s	679.6	 Friedberg, you heard my recap of what you said last, I'm not sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=682.1s	682.1	 if you remembered or you listened. What are your thoughts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=684.2s	684.2	 today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=684.6s	684.6	 I think it's, it's worth just noting less about the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=688.5s	688.5	 particularities of what was said and the particular issue at hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=692.3s	692.3	 here. And I would look more to kind of Brian's leadership style
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=698.7s	698.7	 as an excellent example of defining and creating strong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=701.7s	701.7	 culture, culture in an organization can give that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=706.6s	706.6	 organization what it needs to succeed, it puts everyone aligned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=709.5s	709.5	 in a specific way on how we make decisions how we operate. It
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=712.4s	712.4	 doesn't matter what his particular beliefs and opinions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=714.6s	714.6	 or what to exclude what to include in the dialogue and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=717.4s	717.4	 discourse and the model for discourse within the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=719.1s	719.1	 organization. I think what matters that he put a line in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=722.6s	722.6	 sand. And he said, this is what we're going to do. This is what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=725.3s	725.3	 in and this is what's out. And organizations that do that and do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=729.0s	729.0	 that effectively generally win, they win more, they do better,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=732.3s	732.3	 the teams are aligned, the teams are more unified. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=735.7s	735.7	 that definition may sometimes be controversial. And you'll notice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=738.4s	738.4	 that as companies get bigger, go public, they're larger, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=741.5s	741.5	 bring in professional managers and the founder, CEO steps out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=744.7s	744.7	 they generally don't do that, right? They generally try to not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=748.7s	748.7	 do that definitional work, because they're trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=750.5s	750.5	 minimize loss, and not kind of take the bet on maximizing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=754.2s	754.2	 long term gain and doing the things that they think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=756.2s	756.2	 culturally define or will enable success long term. So I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=760.4s	760.4	 it's a great example of leadership generally on how you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=762.5s	762.5	 kind of can, can be very vocal about defining a strong culture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=766.6s	766.6	 Elon calls it I think Elon calls it corpos speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=769.9s	769.9	 What happens?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=771.5s	771.5	 Like, meaning most companies when they get bigger, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=773.9s	773.9	 gravitate towards corpos speak. And then what happens is, some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=777.2s	777.2	 cohort of employees who are really good, just feel trapped
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=781.0s	781.0	 in this kind of morass of mediocrity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=783.7s	783.7	 And by the way, look at Elon's, you know, call it attrition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=787.5s	787.5	 rate, right? By the typical large scale public company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=790.4s	790.4	 corporate metric of like, how many people are leaving per year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=793.0s	793.0	 you'd say, oh, my gosh, something's up with that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=794.4s	794.4	 organization. But it really speaks to a strong culture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=797.5s	797.5	 There's a company that's famous for this called Bridgewater
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=799.5s	799.5	 Associates, you know, run by Ray Dalio, $100 billion hedge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=802.6s	802.6	 fund, one of the best performing investment vehicles of all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=804.8s	804.8	 time. And they have incredible culture. I've talked about Ray
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=807.6s	807.6	 Dalio's book principles before and some of the work he's done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=810.1s	810.1	 on this, where he is so adamant about getting culture right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=813.1s	813.1	 within the organization, how you operate, that they almost have,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=816.2s	816.2	 I think, a 30% attrition rate after the first year of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=818.9s	818.9	 that come in, because they not only try and screen for these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=821.7s	821.7	 elements of what they consider to be the right cultural fit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=823.9s	823.9	 for their organization upfront, but then they also screen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=826.4s	826.4	 people the heck out of the door if they're not a good fit. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=829.2s	829.2	 I think Elon has a similar sort of model. And you know, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=832.0s	832.0	 Brian, the way he speaks about the organization is a similar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=834.8s	834.8	 model. And it's about defining the lines. It's about being very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=837.8s	837.8	 crystal clear about what's in and what's not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=839.8s	839.8	 Whatever if you as a CEO, and a founder, whatever you believe,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=843.8s	843.8	 you need to believe in it strongly. And you can't clearly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=847.2s	847.2	 then communicate it and then let people vote. They vote with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=850.2s	850.2	 their feet, they don't get to vote whether to change it. They
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=852.8s	852.8	 just get to vote whether they get to stay or whether they go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=855.8s	855.8	 And I think that that's a really smart. I think that's well said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=858.4s	858.4	 Yeah, I think there's one other issue here. Jake, Jake, how this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=861.1s	861.1	 goes back to your point about why did Brian have to bring this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=863.2s	863.2	 back up? Was it unnecessary? Did he spike the hornet's nest in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=866.2s	866.2	 the end zone? Here's why I think it was necessary. If you go to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=869.7s	869.7	 point seven and eight of his tweet storm, he says it was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=873.3s	873.3	 most positive reaction I've gotten from any change I've made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=876.0s	876.0	 in the history of the company, which is saying something, how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=878.4s	878.4	 could something be so negative in the press, but turned out to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=881.1s	881.1	 be incredibly, incredibly positive with every stakeholder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=883.4s	883.4	 95% of, of employees, privately, all the investors were telling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=887.6s	887.6	 him it was a great thing. And then what he says is the only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=889.9s	889.9	 sense I can make of it is there's a huge mismatch right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=892.0s	892.0	 now, between people stated and revealed preferences. And we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=895.3s	895.3	 operating in an environment of virtue signaling and fear of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=898.5s	898.5	 speaking up. So to me, this is the point of this tweet storm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=902.5s	902.5	 and bringing it up now is without people like Brian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=905.9s	905.9	 standing up and saying what the truth is that look, everybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=910.8s	910.8	 wants this, they're just afraid to articulate the principle. We
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=915.7s	915.7	 keep, we keep encouraging this climate of fear. And you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=920.0s	920.0	 the alternative to Coinbase, you know, one of the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=922.3s	922.3	 companies we've talked about is Apple. I mean, you can basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=924.6s	924.6	 choose to be Coinbase or Apple, what is Apple done? They booted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=928.2s	928.2	 out Antonio Garcia Martinez because of a passage in his book
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=932.3s	932.3	 that they knew about. And ever since then, the company's been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=935.0s	935.0	 roiled by boycotts and petition writing from the employees about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=938.7s	938.7	 some new cause every couple of weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=940.2s	940.2	 And eventually that'll show up in the operating results of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=942.8s	942.8	 business. It's just a matter of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=944.5s	944.5	 Right. And so why does that go on? I mean, I'm sure most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=947.9s	947.9	 employees at Apple don't want to be, you know, constantly roiled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=952.2s	952.2	 by these like, petition campaigns. But they have to put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=956.3s	956.3	 up with it because everyone's so afraid to speak up. And that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=959.0s	959.0	 why it's important that what Brian did, we have to basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=961.6s	961.6	 recognize that this woke mob who's cowed everyone to silence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=965.6s	965.6	 is maybe 5% of these companies. And if everybody just acts like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=969.8s	969.8	 Brian, the problem will be over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=971.8s	971.8	 Well, we know we know what the trail of breadcrumbs is right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=974.4s	974.4	 now. And I think we should probably, you know, shine a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=977.1s	977.1	 light on it, which is that that 5% is exactly the same as Donald
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=983.0s	983.0	 Trump, they just exist on the left, you know, and there's an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=986.0s	986.0	 there's more and more research that shows that just as much as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=989.7s	989.7	 we thought they were right, authoritarians, they're also left
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=994.5s	994.5	 authoritarians. And this is what we're seeing that that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=997.8s	997.8	 craziness that you know, everybody decries on the right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1000.8s	1000.8	 actually also exists on the left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1002.2s	1002.2	 And they just put a button on that before we pivot to the next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1004.9s	1004.9	 story. Armstrong was very clear that the mission is about global
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1009.5s	1009.5	 wealth inequality. So staying focused on that, in his mind is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1014.5s	1014.5	 the the high order a bit and will result in the most great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1017.3s	1017.3	 change. So paradoxically, or ironically, you know, all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1020.4s	1020.4	 woke people attacking Coinbase, Coinbase might do more for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1024.2s	1024.2	 wealth and equality and justice in the world. If they stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1027.8s	1027.8	 focused, then if they try to tackle everything and you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1031.2s	1031.2	 this is a road to nowhere for Apple, I think, Sachs, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1034.2s	1034.2	 pointed this out about how if you were running Apple, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1036.5s	1036.5	 would fire anybody who does the petition, because I'll tell you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1039.2s	1039.2	 where Apple is about to basically land by enabling all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1045.4s	1045.4	 of this woke mob inside their own company by coddling them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1048.5s	1048.5	 addressing them and not keeping them focused. They will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1051.8s	1051.8	 eventually get to the fact that China is, you know, has 3 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1057.6s	1057.6	 Uyghurs in a concentration camp, and those Uyghurs are proven to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1062.2s	1062.2	 be providing through slave labor, equipment and components
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1067.3s	1067.3	 to companies that eventually make their way to Apple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1069.7s	1069.7	 products. Ergo, Apple supports slavery. And that's what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1074.6s	1074.6	 employees will eventually get to. And that will cause chaos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1077.3s	1077.3	 But there's something even closer, more closer to home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1079.8s	1079.8	 That that's probably true, or could be true. I don't know. It
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1082.2s	1082.2	 is true. But, you know, the fact that Apple had the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1086.9s	1086.9	 important security leak in their entire software career, just a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1092.2s	1092.2	 few months ago, is also quite important. Like you had a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1096.4s	1096.4	 because why is it so you had a zero so the iOS 14.8 exists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1102.6s	1102.6	 because of why? Because a researcher or a set of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1105.7s	1105.7	 researchers in Toronto discovered that there was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1108.4s	1108.4	 zero click exploit in iOS that allowed you to basically turn on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1113.3s	1113.3	 the microphone, turn on the camera, you know, grab anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1116.1s	1116.1	 you needed from iPhones, it was the most secure device until two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1119.9s	1119.9	 months ago, when it turned out it was actually the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1122.7s	1122.7	 insecure device. So I tend to think I tend to think those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1125.9s	1125.9	 kinds of technical mistakes happen when people take their eye

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1132.0s	1132.0	 because they're demoralized with dealing with distractions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1138.2s	1138.2	 Yeah, I mean, I think it's the whether it's the Uyghurs or the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1142.1s	1142.1	 security issue, it's a good example of the employees at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1145.6s	1145.6	 Apple, see the spec in somebody else's eye, but not the log in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1149.2s	1149.2	 their own. I mean, that's that's the principle. And, and they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1154.1s	1154.1	 would be much better off focusing on dealing with their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1156.2s	1156.2	 own internal issues. But let's go, can we go back to that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1159.6s	1159.6	 article that Jamath referenced about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1161.3s	1161.3	 Yeah, anything you got anything else on this issue that you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1164.9s	1164.9	 before we segue over? No, I thought this is a really great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1168.0s	1168.0	 article. Do you want to explain it? J. Cal? Yeah, I'll just give
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1170.2s	1170.2	 you a quick overview. And then you can dive right in since you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1172.3s	1172.3	 put it on the docket psychiatrist and author Sally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1174.5s	1174.5	 Sattel, hopefully I'm pronouncing that correct wrote an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1176.9s	1176.9	 article for the Atlantic entitled the experts somehow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1179.0s	1179.0	 overlooked authoritarians on the left. The main point here is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1182.2s	1182.2	 that Trump's presidency sparked a ton of research and coverage of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1185.8s	1185.8	 authoritarianism on the right, but mostly ignored the left
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1188.4s	1188.4	 with some researchers even suggesting that the left wing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1191.0s	1191.0	 that left wing authoritarianism isn't real. In an email to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1194.6s	1194.6	 Sattel, a social psychologist from Rutgers said the following
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1198.4s	1198.4	 for seven years, the law, the law in the social sciences has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1202.0s	1202.0	 been that authoritarianism has been found exclusively on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1205.0s	1205.0	 political right. Why is that one reason left wing authoritarian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1208.8s	1208.8	 authoritarianism barely showed up in social psychology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1211.6s	1211.6	 research is that most academic experts in the field are based
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1214.2s	1214.2	 at institutions for prevailing attitudes are far to the left of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1218.1s	1218.1	 society as a whole sex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1220.1s	1220.1	 Well, actually, Chamath put this on the docket. So Chamath, do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1222.8s	1222.8	 you want to introduce what you liked about it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1225.2s	1225.2	 The reason I saw this and I thought it was so interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1227.9s	1227.9	 was basically we had an entire body of research trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1231.3s	1231.3	 understand why some folks are attracted to these authoritarian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1238.2s	1238.2	 figures like Trump. And overwhelmingly, all the research
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1242.1s	1242.1	 at the time said they only exist on the right. And you know, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1245.8s	1245.8	 and all of this started after Hitler. And so there was all this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1250.4s	1250.4	 research around the, you know, social and attitudinal reactions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1254.8s	1254.8	 to Hitler and how he came to power and then all of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1257.2s	1257.2	 iterations of folks like him on the right afterwards. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1261.1s	1261.1	 people put Trump in that category. And then they said it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1264.0s	1264.0	 can only exist there. But as it turns out, when this person did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1267.6s	1267.6	 this research, and she surveyed 7000 people and all of this data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1270.9s	1270.9	 was very well summarized in this Atlantic article, which I'm sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1274.6s	1274.6	 we can post in the show notes that folks should read, lo and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1278.0s	1278.0	 behold, it actually exists on both sides. So as it turns out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1281.4s	1281.4	 the extreme right and the extreme left are exactly the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1284.8s	1284.8	 same. They're moral absolutists. They believe in themselves and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1289.2s	1289.2	 themselves only. And they believe anybody else that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1292.4s	1292.4	 outside of where they are, is fundamentally in the wrong. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1296.6s	1296.6	 if you actually look at that, and see how Trump behaved in his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1300.8s	1300.8	 presidency, and now how you see how the left names and shames,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1306.4s	1306.4	 you factually find a lot of commonality. So the reason I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1309.2s	1309.2	 found that article interesting is that it actually says, again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1311.9s	1311.9	 what we've been saying, which is coming down the middle and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1315.1s	1315.1	 finding, you know, reasonable compromise is the only way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1318.3s	1318.3	 forward. Because this minute you start moving in either direction,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1321.8s	1321.8	 you are the same. And that person is an ugly person that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1325.7s	1325.7	 don't want around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1326.9s	1326.9	 Let me give the money quote and then get your feedback. Freeberg,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1329.4s	1329.4	 the similarities in the study included quote, similarities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1332.5s	1332.5	 between authoritarianism on both sides, left and right. Preference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1335.8s	1335.8	 for social uniformity check prejudice toward different,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1339.4s	1339.4	 different others willingness to wield group authority to coerce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1343.0s	1343.0	 behavior, cognitive rigidity, aggression and punitiveness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1347.2s	1347.2	 toward perceived enemies, outsize concern for hierarchy. And as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1352.8s	1352.8	 Chamath pointed out moral absolute absolutism. Freeberg,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1356.2s	1356.2	 I think authoritarian figures resolve when a population feels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1364.3s	1364.3	 insecure. So I mean, we talked about this last pod, but I do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1369.0s	1369.0	 think that, you know, the notion of freedom emerges after the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1373.9s	1373.9	 comfort of security has been provided. And I think the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1377.1s	1377.1	 absence of security drives people away from the drive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1381.1s	1381.1	 towards freedom. Like, when you have a feeling of insecurity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1385.8s	1385.8	 with respect to kind of your ability to get a job, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1388.6s	1388.6	 remember, Hitler rose to power, when unemployment, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1393.0s	1393.0	 post Weimar Republic was skyrocketing, people, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1397.4s	1397.4	 couldn't get jobs, they couldn't afford food. And the authoritarian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1401.4s	1401.4	 figure was going to provide the security needed, I think, to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1404.3s	1404.3	 resolve the concerns that the population had. And then, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1407.7s	1407.7	 know, people latch on to that. So, you know, there are moments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1410.7s	1410.7	 in time when I think authoritarianism can emerge with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1414.0s	1414.0	 different forms of resolution. It doesn't necessarily mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1416.8s	1416.8	 that the authoritarian actor needs to take a left or right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1420.1s	1420.1	 point of view, they're just going to give you a path to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1422.2s	1422.2	 security when you're feeling insecure. If you don't feel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1424.5s	1424.5	 insecure, you're going to say that's ridiculous. So countries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1427.0s	1427.0	 that are wealthy countries that are privileged with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1430.4s	1430.4	 opportunities that maybe the United States has are less
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1432.8s	1432.8	 likely and less inclined to fall in, you know, in favor of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1436.4s	1436.4	 authoritarian leaders. And then as we slip backwards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1441.4s	1441.4	 economically, unemployment wise, etc, we're more likely to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1444.6s	1444.6	 be to be in favor of those sorts of actors. And so I think that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1449.3s	1449.3	 you know, we'll see him emerge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1450.4s	1450.4	 But don't you think it's crazy that we actually didn't think it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1453.6s	1453.6	 could exist in one end of the political spectrum and now it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1456.2s	1456.2	 does you have a point in that or no,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1457.6s	1457.6	 I never really understood the whole like Hitler is purely a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1460.4s	1460.4	 right wing guy. Like, he was a, you know, a socialist and he was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1465.0s	1465.0	 trying to enable like, you know, socialized services and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1467.6s	1467.6	 socialized systems for people, you know, in a lot of political
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1470.7s	1470.7	 circles that would be argued as being a very kind of left point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1473.1s	1473.1	 of view. And so I don't know if it Yeah, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1476.7s	1476.7	 let's go beyond. Let's go beyond Hitler. You're right. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1480.1s	1480.1	 Nazi Party was a National Socialist Party. That's what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1482.8s	1482.8	 that's what the name of the party was. But there's also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1485.4s	1485.4	 Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao. I mean, if you're paying attention to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1488.9s	1488.9	 history, you know that there's been authoritarianism on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1492.4s	1492.4	 left, not just the right and so but, you know, in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1496.6s	1496.6	 universities, and in the media, they only want to focus on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1499.7s	1499.7	 right wing version of it. And I think what the study does is it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1503.0s	1503.0	 upend 70 years of dogma that that you know, authoritarian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1507.4s	1507.4	 authoritarianism is only to be found on the political right. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1510.8s	1510.8	 mean, it's obviously can be found on the political left as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1513.4s	1513.4	 well. And you can see that in cancel culture, in speech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1517.4s	1517.4	 restrictions, in these very aggressive COVID mandates that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1522.7s	1522.7	 are now happening. You can see it in the the sort of the the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1528.8s	1528.8	 ghoulishness anytime somebody in the right, you know, dies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1532.4s	1532.4	 from COVID. I mean, there's, there's always some chortling on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1536.4s	1536.4	 the part of the left about this, the harsh penalties for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1539.0s	1539.0	 noncompliance. I mean, right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1541.8s	1541.8	 rigidity is the one that stands out for me, like, there is just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1545.4s	1545.4	 on the left, they make a decision Amazon is bad. And they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1549.1s	1549.1	 cannot move off of that. Right, David, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1551.4s	1551.4	 what about what about willingness to wield group
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1553.4s	1553.4	 authority to course behavior? And what about aggression and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1555.7s	1555.7	 punitiveness towards perceived
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1557.5s	1557.5	 cancel culture, that would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1558.8s	1558.8	 cancel culture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1559.4s	1559.4	 To me is it begs a good question, which is what socialist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1565.9s	1565.9	 regimes have come to power without an authoritarian figure?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1571.2s	1571.2	 Has there just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1572.3s	1572.3	 none?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1573.9s	1573.9	 They're all revolutionaries. Right. Actually, the study has a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1577.1s	1577.1	 really good point about this, which is they they say that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1580.7s	1580.7	 researchers describe what they called anti hierarchical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1583.2s	1583.2	 aggression. So one of the traits of authoritarianism is is they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1587.4s	1587.4	 call it an outsized concern for a hierarchy. But you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1590.5s	1590.5	 leftists think that they don't believe in hierarchy, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1593.0s	1593.0	 actually they do they believe in an anti hierarchical hierarchy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1596.4s	1596.4	 which is they want to turn upside down the social hierarchy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1600.0s	1600.0	 and they're willing to justify the the the ends justify the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1603.3s	1603.3	 means. In other words, if you can turn the hierarchy upside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1606.0s	1606.0	 down, they'll let you do anything. And it's actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1608.8s	1608.8	 pretty scary. That's where the sort of the revolution comes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1611.3s	1611.3	 from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1612.0s	1612.0	 Here's a practical thing, Jay, Cal about what you said, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1614.9s	1614.9	 illustrates this point even further. Right now we have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1618.4s	1618.4	 three and a half trillion dollar bill kind of meandering through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1623.0s	1623.0	 Congress. And you know, it's very much a question mark about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1625.7s	1625.7	 whether it gets passed or not. And one of the elements that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1628.4s	1628.4	 in there is free community college. Now, when it passes, if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1635.6s	1635.6	 it passes, there's a lot of support that that's something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1640.1s	1640.1	 that the government should do. It's a good thing. But if you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1643.4s	1643.4	 a private company like Amazon, who just announced that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1645.8s	1645.8	 will give you free college, they're still a bad company. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1650.5s	1650.5	 and this is the example of this intellectual rigidity that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1653.4s	1653.4	 doesn't actually see the forest from the trees. What do you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1656.0s	1656.0	 really want? Do you want the process where you control and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1659.5s	1659.5	 meter out progress? Or do you actually want the outcome where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1662.9s	1662.9	 somebody can get a job where they make 15 or $20 an hour, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1666.4s	1666.4	 also now get college paid for? Yes, I personally want the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1669.8s	1669.8	 latter. Yeah, we much better if they want didn't have to provide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1672.9s	1672.9	 I'd love I'd love it if the government could pay for it. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1675.5s	1675.5	 I'm really glad that Amazon is in a position to pay for it as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1678.0s	1678.0	 well. But if you start to become absolutist and say, well, no, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1681.9s	1681.9	 just needs to be top down and metered out this way. And any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1684.9s	1684.9	 private organization that wants to try to do it is still bad. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1688.5s	1688.5	 think that's where that rigidity holds us all back. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1691.0s	1691.0	 unnecessary. Here's where I see the rigidity. Each month is they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1694.3s	1694.3	 keep saying gig workers are bad. Nobody should be allowed to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1697.5s	1697.5	 a gig worker. And David had a great interview with the ride
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1700.2s	1700.2	 sharing guy on Colin, and in which they talked about the fact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1703.8s	1703.8	 and this is somebody who is super pro advocate of drivers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1706.9s	1706.9	 said, listen, 80% of people do not want to do shift work. They
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1710.8s	1710.8	 do not want the government dictating how they work. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1714.7s	1714.7	 talked anecdotally with an Uber driver studies making like 70
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1718.4s	1718.4	 bucks an hour during peak hours. They were fighting to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1722.8s	1722.8	 minimum wage for drivers. Now drivers are making 2030 40 $50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1728.1s	1728.1	 an hour Uber rides have gone and lift rides. It's a massive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1732.1s	1732.1	 competition market works. Well, and they can't take the win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1736.1s	1736.1	 They still are so rigid on the left that they're demanding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1739.6s	1739.6	 whatever that woman's name is who is you know, in the pocket
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1742.2s	1742.2	 of the rena Gonzalez, Lorraine Gonzalez in the pocket of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1745.2s	1745.2	 unions. How cynical are they? The victory is upon them. Yes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1751.1s	1751.1	 people are getting paid five times more three times more than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1753.8s	1753.8	 minimum wage, and they still want to screw them. The takeaway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1756.6s	1756.6	 for a lot of people should be that your spidey senses should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1759.7s	1759.7	 go up when folks present solutions as a choice of one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1765.5s	1765.5	 source only. Ah, you know, when things when things can only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1770.4s	1770.4	 happen in one way, and it's the way that I feel the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1773.5s	1773.5	 comfortable. Yeah, your spidey sensor should go up and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1776.1s	1776.1	 should think to yourself, really, is that is that really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1778.6s	1778.6	 the only way like can't we have choice? Can't we have different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1782.4s	1782.4	 ways of solving this? Can't maybe we can run an experiment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1784.9s	1784.9	 and see what happens? Go ahead, sex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1786.6s	1786.6	 Well, I think your spidey sense should also go up whenever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1789.4s	1789.4	 somebody is basically saying that speech needs to be censored
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1793.1s	1793.1	 for some higher purpose, you know, that that that whenever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1797.3s	1797.3	 people are trying to abridge and take away our rights and our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1802.7s	1802.7	 sort of long held values, our freedoms, you have to start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1806.9s	1806.9	 getting concerned. And there's always a reason why they want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1809.9s	1809.9	 do it. In the study, the quote that the the left wing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1813.2s	1813.2	 authoritarians agreed with was getting rid of inequality is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1816.8s	1816.8	 more important than protecting the so called right to free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1819.0s	1819.0	 speech. So there's always some higher reason the means always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1822.7s	1822.7	 justify the the ends always justify the means. But but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1826.6s	1826.6	 that's that's what you have to look out for is when they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1828.4s	1828.4	 taking away your right to speech to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1829.9s	1829.9	 another fun proof point. Fun, because it's Dave Chappelle that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1834.4s	1834.4	 you can listen to or watch to see a flavor of this left wing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1838.4s	1838.4	 authoritarianism is called redemption song, which is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1841.2s	1841.2	 little clip he put out recently. And the the entire clip is more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1846.0s	1846.0	 about him getting his body of work back from Comedy Central.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1850.2s	1850.2	 But the part in the beginning talks about folks on the left
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1854.4s	1854.4	 that really tried to dunk on him when he got COVID. And you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1859.2s	1859.2	 should just listen to his reaction and how he frames it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1862.0s	1862.0	 Because I think it's pretty powerful. And again, it explains
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1864.4s	1864.4	 that extremism on both sides, they actually end up looking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1867.6s	1867.6	 the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1868.6s	1868.6	 Yeah, aggression and punitiveness towards perceived
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1870.7s	1870.7	 enemies. And I think that applies to anyone who, anyone who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1874.3s	1874.3	 defies the whatever the conventional wisdom is on COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1879.1s	1879.1	 There's another another example in the study of that, that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1883.2s	1883.2	 people who the left wing authoritarians agreed with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1885.2s	1885.2	 statement, I cannot imagine myself becoming friends with a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1887.9s	1887.9	 political conservative. So you know, you've got these social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1891.0s	1891.0	 groups that are completely uniform. And by the way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1893.6s	1893.6	 there've been like studies for a long time showing that liberals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1897.6s	1897.6	 are twice as likely as conservatives to be upset if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1900.3s	1900.3	 their son or daughter were to marry someone of the opposite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1902.4s	1902.4	 party. So this has been a this has been turned up in polls for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1905.4s	1905.4	 a while. But this and you've seen it on universities and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1908.6s	1908.6	 college campuses, right? But there's this idea that you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1911.5s	1911.5	 anybody of the other political side is just suspect, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1916.3s	1916.3	 morally suspect needs to be shunned, needs to be expelled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1920.9s	1920.9	 Like those are the people you have to be concerned about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1923.5s	1923.5	 Yeah, you can't be friends. I can't be friends with you, Sax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1926.0s	1926.0	 because you voted for Trump. It's just ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1930.0s	1930.0	 No, but it's, I think it's the derangement to give the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1934.2s	1934.2	 side of this. I think Trump was so extreme and so trolling and so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1937.7s	1937.7	 great. I mean, if you think about his superpower, it was to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1941.2s	1941.2	 troll the left and put them into such a deranged mindset, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1944.9s	1944.9	 they did actually become that which they hated most.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1948.6s	1948.6	 Right. But he did he did troll the left. But but here's, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1951.7s	1951.7	 here's the thing is that we only hear in the media about the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1955.9s	1955.9	 authoritarianism of the Trump administration, how many times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1959.6s	1959.6	 were they screaming fascism during the Trump years? And, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1964.0s	1964.0	 now today, and of course, you know, if you go to MSNBC, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1967.6s	1967.6	 January six all day all the time, that's all they want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1970.1s	1970.1	 talk about. But you there's a total blind spot with respect to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1973.7s	1973.7	 the authoritarian tendencies of the left, which we see right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1977.4s	1977.4	 in COVID policy. I mean, it is getting so extreme right now. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1981.1s	1981.1	 I mean, Freeberg, you posted the breaking news that just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1984.5s	1984.5	 announced via press conference Gavin Newsom is now implementing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1987.7s	1987.7	 mandated COVID vaccines for all public K through 12 schools in

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1994.4s	1994.4	 Wait, wait, these students? Yeah. All eligible kids in all in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=1999.6s	1999.6	 all public schools in order to go to school in California, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2002.6s	2002.6	 have to have a vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2004.2s	2004.2	 I mean, kindergarten, kindergarten. Well, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2007.8s	2007.8	 they're not eligible yet. If it's when they're eligible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2010.3s	2010.3	 Yeah, they're, they're, they're gonna be eligible very soon. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2014.0s	2014.0	 mean, look, I, so, so we have a 13 year old and 11 year old and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2018.6s	2018.6	 a five year old, the 13 year old got vaccinated, she wanted to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2022.3s	2022.3	 we supported it, the 11 year old wasn't eligible, she didn't get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2025.2s	2025.2	 a vaccine, she got COVID. For me, it was a mild case. And our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2028.2s	2028.2	 five year old isn't eligible for the vaccine, he never got COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2031.0s	2031.0	 Now, if if and when a new vaccine comes out that our five
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2035.2s	2035.2	 year old is eligible, I don't think he needs it. I mean, I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2037.6s	2037.6	 not anti vax. I mean, I'm glad I got the vaccine. I'm glad, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2041.6s	2041.6	 know, going to school by 13 year old got the vaccine. Yeah, he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2044.8s	2044.8	 goes to school.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2045.4s	2045.4	 The question is, do you if it is safe, do you want them going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2048.0s	2048.0	 school catching it spreading it? And do you want them to not have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2051.2s	2051.2	 to wear a mask?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2051.8s	2051.8	 How can you say conclusively? What say for a five or six year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2056.6s	2056.6	 old at this point?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2057.4s	2057.4	 It's a little hard. Their bodies are developing. And yeah, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2059.6s	2059.6	 need some time. Do we really need to mandate this? I mean, why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2062.7s	2062.7	 why can't parents make up their own decision?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2064.6s	2064.6	 Because of other people in society who would be impacted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2067.2s	2067.2	 I mean, you also see this, you know, look, I think I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2070.0s	2070.0	 vaccines maybe are complicated debate because vaccines do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2072.4s	2072.4	 actually provide protection. Let's talk about these mass
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2075.4s	2075.4	 mandates, which I supported at the beginning of the pandemic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2078.4s	2078.4	 because it's all we had to fight it. But you take an example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2080.8s	2080.8	 like San Francisco, still has these stringent mass mandates,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2084.0s	2084.0	 the mayor London breed was caught out at dancing, singing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2088.2s	2088.2	 at a club, screaming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2090.0s	2090.0	 To her, it was Tony, Tony, Tony.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2091.7s	2091.7	 I mean, that's what she's done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2093.3s	2093.3	 She was like, she was basically like, it's Tony, Tony, Tony,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2096.8s	2096.8	 guys. I'll risk the COVID, which is personal freedom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2100.1s	2100.1	 I had to give her that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2101.2s	2101.2	 If you want to risk if you want to play poker, or see your

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2107.5s	2107.5	 you want her to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2108.1s	2108.1	 Think about let me ask this question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2110.6s	2110.6	 What she said when she got caught was actually correct,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2113.2s	2113.2	 which is we should be out supporting restaurants, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2115.6s	2115.6	 should be out supporting nightlife, adults should be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2117.7s	2117.7	 able to make their own decision about the risks they're willing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2120.2s	2120.2	 to take. The problem is, she's not willing to give the rest of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2122.7s	2122.7	 us that choice, right? And we can all make our own choice. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2126.0s	2126.0	 by the way, look, the idea that the COVID is not going to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2129.6s	2129.6	 you with you know, once you take off your mask, when you get to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2133.5s	2133.5	 the table, you know, we've talked about that. Yeah, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2136.8s	2136.8	 wear the mask and the made or d stand to the table, then you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2139.4s	2139.4	 take it off to eat and drink. And the COVID somehow not going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2142.2s	2142.2	 to get in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2144.0s	2144.0	 She was saying she was like, I listen, they were like, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2147.0s	2147.0	 weren't eating, we have you on video, you weren't drinking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2149.0s	2149.0	 She's like, it's unrealistic for an adult to put the mask on and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2152.1s	2152.1	 off in between sips and bites. And I was on a flight and I was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2155.6s	2155.6	 flying coach as opposed to business class recently. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2158.6s	2158.6	 when I was in business class, I was eating and drinking, there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2161.8s	2161.8	 was no entire foreign language so far you're speaking what are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2164.6s	2164.6	 you saying? So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2168.0s	2168.0	 most people pay for a plane ticket and then they get on an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2170.6s	2170.6	 airplane. So but the interesting thing was when I was in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2173.6s	2173.6	 business class, I was eating my meal, I was drinking no issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2177.1s	2177.1	 I had the mask off for whatever 20 minutes I was eating and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2179.3s	2179.3	 drinking. When I was in coach, same situation, the flight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2183.2s	2183.2	 attendant was going up and down the aisle. And while people were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2186.0s	2186.0	 eating and drinking, if they didn't have the mask on, she was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2187.8s	2187.8	 kind of being like a whole monitor saying please put your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2190.7s	2190.7	 mask on in between bites. And I was like, okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2195.8s	2195.8	 Yeah. And when we supported this mass mandate way at the beginning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2198.4s	2198.4	 of the vaccine, we all thought the government's gonna distribute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2200.6s	2200.6	 n 99 or at least n 95 high quality 3m mass, right? We never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2204.8s	2204.8	 got those. We never got to their kids. I know, people people are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2209.1s	2209.1	 like walking around wearing these cloth, these loose fitting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2211.7s	2211.7	 cloth mass. It's ridiculous. It's the other the COVID goes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2215.4s	2215.4	 you know, through the bottom over the top through the site,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2217.5s	2217.5	 go right through it. I mean, like it doesn't do anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2220.5s	2220.5	 And you're the Lone Ranger. Yeah. How's that? Well, I mean, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2223.1s	2223.1	 look, if you were a high quality, like, you know, PPE type
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2227.7s	2227.7	 mask, I think it might be helpful. But you know, it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2231.5s	2231.5	 marginal benefit once we have vaccines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2233.6s	2233.6	 Oh, by the way, just as we end this, what do we think of? Andrew
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2239.6s	2239.6	 Wiggin? Well, you can't comment on this, maybe because you're an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2241.9s	2241.9	 owner on the team, but a number of NBA players, high profile
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2246.3s	2246.3	 ones, in fact, in New York and California, where you're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2249.2s	2249.2	 allowed in the arena, if you're not vaccinated, are now deciding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2252.9s	2252.9	 to sit out their home games. So Kyrie Irving being the highest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2257.2s	2257.2	 profile one is refusing to get the vaccine. And he will be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2262.7s	2262.7	 getting paid. He's got a $200 million contract max player, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2265.4s	2265.4	 think he gets 40 50 million a year. He's going to give up half
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2269.0s	2269.0	 of his salary to not 20 million a year to not get the vaccine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2272.9s	2272.9	 at least and leave his team to not play with them in home games.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2277.9s	2277.9	 What are our thoughts on mandating NBA players who are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2282.0s	2282.0	 playing inside an arena to be vaccinated?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2284.8s	2284.8	 DC Drainmonds interview?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2286.8s	2286.8	 I did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2287.5s	2287.5	 What did what did they have to say about this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2290.1s	2290.1	 He says that he's so fucking strong, isn't he?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2292.4s	2292.4	 Yeah, he was like, this is ridiculous that we don't like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2295.1s	2295.1	 respect each other's like we've made this so political. And it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2298.3s	2298.3	 all like antagonistic as opposed to metta recognizing that there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2302.4s	2302.4	 are differences and people have differences of opinion and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2304.8s	2304.8	 respecting them and embracing each other for those differences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2307.3s	2307.3	 rather than like, attacking each other and finding fault in each
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2310.2s	2310.2	 other. And forcing them. And it's a great point. But I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2314.8s	2314.8	 know. I mean, I don't think that this point is any different than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2317.0s	2317.0	 the point about, you know, mandating a vaccine for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2319.3s	2319.3	 anything, any workplace, any school. I mean, if you're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2322.6s	2322.6	 to mandate if you're going to mandate vaccines for workplaces
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2325.5s	2325.5	 and mandate vaccines for schools, you know, the NBA is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2328.7s	2328.7	 gonna, you know, not be kind of excluded here. It's what it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2332.6s	2332.6	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2333.0s	2333.0	 Just happens to be a bigger paycheck and a higher profile
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2335.1s	2335.1	 stage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2335.6s	2335.6	 I think as a matter of policy, the right policy here is to let
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2338.6s	2338.6	 private employers decide whether they're going to require
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2342.2s	2342.2	 vaccination or not. I think I think private organizations have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2344.9s	2344.9	 the right to do that. If you know, if a restaurateur wants to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2347.9s	2347.9	 say that we are going to be an all vax restaurant, you want to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2351.2s	2351.2	 you know, they're only going to take clientele who are vax, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2353.9s	2353.9	 should be their right to do it. If another restaurant says we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2356.0s	2356.0	 don't care, people can go to that restaurant if they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2358.9s	2358.9	 But you know, I think that the free market can sort of sort
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2361.5s	2361.5	 this out. I don't know that we need the government imposing it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2363.7s	2363.7	 if the NBA decides this is what they want to do. They can't has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2366.5s	2366.5	 decided decision. Well, I mean, what I wonder about is how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2370.7s	2370.7	 necessary it is. I mean, given the fact that, you know, all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2374.9s	2374.9	 players are young and healthy. And if they want the vaccine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2378.8s	2378.8	 they can get the vaccine. Look, I'm really glad I got it. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2381.9s	2381.9	 know, I think it but but I just you know, if given that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2386.3s	2386.3	 everybody is vaccinated now who wants it, I just you know, what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2390.5s	2390.5	 is the point of forcing that last 10% of holdouts to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2394.8s	2394.8	 something they don't want to do? I mean, this is where I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2397.5s	2397.5	 the authority I would resist the authoritarian impulse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2400.5s	2400.5	 Friedberg, is there a new pill that's coming out? I saw a story
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2404.7s	2404.7	 today about this. I don't know if I want to cover that or go to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2406.9s	2406.9	 Unicorns first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2408.4s	2408.4	 Merck published some results on this basically antiviral pill,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2415.1s	2415.1	 it effectively inhibits RNA replication in viruses. And it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2421.5s	2421.5	 kind of, it was designed to be kind of broadly applicable. It
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2424.5s	2424.5	 was, you know, discovered at Emory University years ago. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2428.8s	2428.8	 they were testing it for influenza. And then even pre
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2431.7s	2431.7	 pre COVID, they were testing it on other kind of coronaviruses,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2435.5s	2435.5	 SARS and MERS. And so the data that they just published shows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2441.3s	2441.3	 that there's a 50% reduction in hospitalizations 50% in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2446.1s	2446.1	 hospitalizations for for people that are the test positive for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2451.2s	2451.2	 SARS CoV 2 infection, and then they start the pill within some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2454.5s	2454.5	 number of hours, you take a few of these pills, I think they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2456.8s	2456.8	 said five days, right? Yeah, well, they did the test on like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2460.5s	2460.5	 it was effectively Yeah, four or five days. That's right. When
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2464.2s	2464.2	 you end up reducing the number, the percentage of people that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2466.6s	2466.6	 end up in the hospital by 50%. Now, you know, the idea is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2471.7s	2471.7	 for countries that don't have access to vaccines, you can very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2476.0s	2476.0	 cheaply make this chemistry, it's a cheap molecule that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2478.7s	2478.7	 could theoretically produce at scale, and you could ship it all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2481.1s	2481.1	 over the world. And countries that don't have, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2484.2s	2484.2	 broad scale vaccination programs, they can make these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2486.4s	2486.4	 pills available quickly and cheaply. And then you know, as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2489.5s	2489.5	 people get infected with SARS CoV 2, they just pick up this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2492.2s	2492.2	 pill, you know, put it in every pharmacy, go grab a couple. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2495.4s	2495.4	 then the hospitalization rate goes down. We don't yet know if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2498.7s	2498.7	 it reduces the transmission rate. So there's a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2501.3s	2501.3	 question marks. And like, does this actually solve the problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2504.5s	2504.5	 of the pandemic? It's certainly a another instrument to blunt the,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2508.5s	2508.5	 you know, the impact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2509.3s	2509.3	 Pronounce the name of it. It's Malnupiravir. Malnupiravir. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2514.6s	2514.6	 government,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2516.0s	2516.0	 by the way, there wasn't a lot of people in the study, no one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2519.0s	2519.0	 that took the pill died, people that didn't take the pill did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2522.0s	2522.0	 die in the infection, in the infected population, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2525.8s	2525.8	 they split them, right? They gave some people a placebo and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2527.8s	2527.8	 some people the pill, the people that had the placebo, there were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2529.9s	2529.9	 deaths, no one in the group that had the pill, the actual pill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2534.0s	2534.0	 died. And so, you know, so theoretically, we don't yet have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2537.7s	2537.7	 enough data to know. But there's also a big question on the side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2540.2s	2540.2	 effects. Typically, these anti viral, the RNA kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2545.7s	2545.7	 blocking drugs have other side effects. They're usually pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2549.8s	2549.8	 mild, but you know, so so there'll be a little bit more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2553.1s	2553.1	 studying. But generally, people view this as a super big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2555.0s	2555.0	 positive. It's another instrument.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2556.8s	2556.8	 I'm going to make it I'm going to make a prediction. Here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2560.8s	2560.8	 I think that the combination of vaccines and what is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2564.2s	2564.2	 equivalently Tamiflu for COVID, which is effectively what this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2568.5s	2568.5	 is, is the one to punch we need, so that this basically is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2573.3s	2573.3	 rendered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2574.9s	2574.9	 You're missing the three you're missing a key piece there, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2577.0s	2577.0	 testing, you must have testing to know that you have to take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2580.0s	2580.0	 this. But I think that that's a I think like the testing is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2583.7s	2583.7	 it's not efficient, but the solutions exist. My point is, if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2586.7s	2586.7	 you have a combination of all these things, this is like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2589.0s	2589.0	 flu, which means that there'll be less ability for folks to not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2592.8s	2592.8	 show up to work, which means that most of the economy will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2595.8s	2595.8	 get back going. And I think then we can get back to really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2600.0s	2600.0	 addressing what are all that 10 or $12 trillion? How does it show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2603.7s	2603.7	 up in the economy? That's where the inflation comes from. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2606.4s	2606.4	 for all this other stuff. So I'm, I'm pretty excited by what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2610.3s	2610.3	 I read today. But now my mindset is going to 18 months from now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2614.6s	2614.6	 midterm inflation, I think that's going to be what it's all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2618.5s	2618.5	 about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2619.0s	2619.0	 We ordered 1.7 million courses of this alcohol. It's a, we can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2623.2s	2623.2	 just call basically this is the equivalent of a Z pack. So I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2625.4s	2625.4	 called as the impact. If this hits,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2628.6s	2628.6	 I've taken probably 1.7 million Z packs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2631.9s	2631.9	 That's just on the way back from Vegas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2635.8s	2635.8	 So I mean, this feels like the end game and they are going for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2639.7s	2639.7	 emergency use. So let's keep our fingers crossed. This would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2641.9s	2641.9	 mean the stock market is going to rip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2645.2s	2645.2	 I know, I think the stock market is in a little bit of precarious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2648.9s	2648.9	 position. Because if you have to if you have to reposition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2651.3s	2651.3	 yourself for inflation, there's a lot of tech stocks that will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2655.1s	2655.1	 get just absolutely obliterated. Like, well, when you when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2660.1s	2660.1	 have inflation, so the the order of operations, inflation means
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2663.8s	2663.8	 prices go up. The government sees prices going up. And they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2668.1s	2668.1	 say, how do we control that they raise interest rates so that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2671.0s	2671.0	 cost of borrowing goes up so that then less money is being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2673.9s	2673.9	 spent, right, so that we become a little bit more restrained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2676.9s	2676.9	 When you do that, then all of a sudden people have to think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2680.5s	2680.5	 about how much money you're going to make in the future,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2682.5s	2682.5	 because if you're not investing as much in the future, you won't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2684.9s	2684.9	 make as much in the future. And when you discount all those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2687.6s	2687.6	 dollars back, there's less of them. And so all of a sudden,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2690.9s	2690.9	 you start to think about, oh, my gosh, well, I want dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2693.5s	2693.5	 today, not dollars 10 years from now. That really puts a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2698.1s	2698.1	 pressure on tech stocks, because we trade on multi year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2702.1s	2702.1	 valuations in the future. So inflation is very bad for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2705.0s	2705.0	 technology stocks. Inflation tends to be good for companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2708.3s	2708.3	 that make money today. Why? Because if I get a dollar today,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2711.3s	2711.3	 I can put it in this in the, you know, bond markets, or I put it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2715.2s	2715.2	 into a savings account, and I can get more interest than I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2717.6s	2717.6	 would have otherwise. And then separately, you also want to own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2721.1s	2721.1	 things that are physical and real, because those have more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2723.3s	2723.3	 value. So all of that has to then get worked out into the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2726.9s	2726.9	 economy. And we have to make a bunch of economic decisions. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2730.9s	2730.9	 we so now the solution for that in all of those cases, though,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2733.9s	2733.9	 is still if you're a hyper growth company, you'll be okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2736.0s	2736.0	 So if you're growing more than 50 60%, a year, you're fine. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2739.1s	2739.1	 if you're growing 20 or 30%, and you're kind of a middling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2741.8s	2741.8	 business, and rates are going up and inflation is going up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2745.1s	2745.1	 you're in a very, very, very precarious spot. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2748.9s	2748.9	 sacks, what do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2750.9s	2750.9	 Okay, well, there was, there was a great article in the Wall Street
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2754.0s	2754.0	 Journal over the past week called University endowment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2756.8s	2756.8	 meant billions in the golden era of venture capital is basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2760.1s	2760.1	 talking about I mean, these these university endowments are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2763.0s	2763.0	 like gaining 50% year over year, there's been like nothing like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2765.4s	2765.4	 it before, there's so many unicorns being created, there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2768.7s	2768.7	 an if you there's a separate article in I think, pitch book
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2770.9s	2770.9	 as well about the rate of unicorn or crunch base, yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2774.4s	2774.4	 that the rate of unicorn creation, I think last year, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2777.8s	2777.8	 was like one every few days. Now it's it's more than one a day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2780.9s	2780.9	 bonkers. And so you know, we're getting multiple unicorns now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2784.4s	2784.4	 created every day this year, it's just this golden era VC,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2788.6s	2788.6	 this engine of wealth and prosperity creation. So that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2792.6s	2792.6	 the good news. And to connect this to a point we were talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2795.0s	2795.0	 about earlier, if the the radicals on the left would just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2799.2s	2799.2	 allow the golden goose to keep laying golden eggs, we're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2803.3s	2803.3	 to have enough wealth and prosperity to pay for all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2806.5s	2806.5	 progressive programs in the long run. But they're not willing to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2810.3s	2810.3	 wait. And so you have in Washington, for example, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2814.7s	2814.7	 a political program that really could upset the apple cart, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2817.7s	2817.7	 mean, you're talking about a three and a half trillion dollar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2821.0s	2821.0	 reconciliation bill, it'll probably get brought down to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2823.7s	2823.7	 somewhere between one and a half and two, then you got a 1.2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2827.2s	2827.2	 trillion dollar infrastructure bill, they've already spent 1.9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2830.2s	2830.2	 trillion on a COVID relief bill. This is after the 6 trillion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2833.5s	2833.5	 What would you advise should be the amount spent?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2836.4s	2836.4	 Well, okay, good question. So last year, the federal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2839.8s	2839.8	 government generated record tax receipts, the most revenue it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2844.8s	2844.8	 ever raised, and it was about 19 and a half percent of GDP. When
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2849.3s	2849.3	 Bill Clinton left office, he broasted about the fact that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2853.2s	2853.2	 government spending was only 18 and a half percent of GDP. Last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2858.7s	2858.7	 year, it was about 30% of GDP. My theory on this is that if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2863.4s	2863.4	 have government spending as a share of the economy at around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2868.4s	2868.4	 20%, from a tax and spending standpoint, things basically work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2873.8s	2873.8	 Okay. But as you try to go up to 25 and 30%, it starts to break,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2877.5s	2877.5	 you have too much deficits and debt, too much money printing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2881.0s	2881.0	 too much taxation, too much inflation, you become more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2884.6s	2884.6	 brittle, and you start to you basically are, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2887.4s	2887.4	 unhealthy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2888.3s	2888.3	 you're killing the golden goose. And so, you know, all we have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2892.2s	2892.2	 do is let the economy keep ripping. 20% of it is gonna is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2896.7s	2896.7	 gonna be government share. And you'll be able to fund more and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2900.2s	2900.2	 more progressive programs over time as society gets richer. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2904.6s	2904.6	 by the way, this this prosperity that's being created in the tech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2909.7s	2909.7	 ecosystem, it's available to anybody who has a good idea. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2913.2s	2913.2	 mean, this is not so as we all know, so it's not just government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2917.2s	2917.2	 that's creating advancement, and economic opportunity for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2920.8s	2920.8	 disadvantaged people, the tech economy is creating it as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2923.8s	2923.8	 And what I worry about is, is why are we taking so much risk in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2927.4s	2927.4	 upending this whole system that is working quite well?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2930.9s	2930.9	 Well, the other thing is, this is all in the face of there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2933.3s	2933.3	 being 11 million open jobs, there's 1.4 jobs for everybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2938.2s	2938.2	 who's unemployed. So the idea that in some ways, society is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2941.6s	2941.6	 broken, and people can't be employed. Now, these might not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2944.5s	2944.5	 be the greatest jobs. There's only 4 million. There's only 4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2946.8s	2946.8	 million people looking for work. There's 11 million outstanding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2949.5s	2949.5	 jobs. Yeah, I mean, it is bonkers Friedberg. Would you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2952.8s	2952.8	 think this is sustainable? What are your thoughts on spending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2955.7s	2955.7	 and turning over the apple cart as sex is saying?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2959.6s	2959.6	 The longer you guys have me on this podcast, the more likely it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2963.6s	2963.6	 is you guys are going to unmask me as a diehard libertarian. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2968.0s	2968.0	 will not let my tendencies, you know, come out in full force.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2972.0s	2972.0	 The spending is ridiculous. And there's a lot of waste. So I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2974.4s	2974.4	 mean, I'll just leave it at that. What I think is interesting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2976.4s	2976.4	 though, is this unicorn creation system. This unicorn creation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2981.5s	2981.5	 machine. You know, it's worth highlighting, because I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2984.4s	2984.4	 that that crunch based article showed that these unicorns in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2988.1s	2988.1	 aggregate were worth like, what, one and a half trillion dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2990.2s	2990.2	 or something. And so those are all private companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2993.8s	2993.8	 3.4 trillion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2996.1s	2996.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2996.7s	2996.7	 Is that the amount of both bills?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=2999.2s	2999.2	 3.4 trillion is the total market cap of all the private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3002.9s	3002.9	 unicorns, not just in the US, but at the world. And right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3006.0s	3006.0	 in Washington, they're talking about three and a half trillion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3007.8s	3007.8	 dollar reconciliation bill, same size. Can you imagine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3011.3s	3011.3	 government spending, basically the entire value of the tech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3015.0s	3015.0	 ecosystem in one year? It's bonkers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3017.3s	3017.3	 Right. And so this, but by the way, I mean, like, I think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3020.1s	3020.1	 that 3.5 trillion, you can kind of think about that as being the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3023.2s	3023.2	 future economy of the future global economy, right? So the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3027.0s	3027.0	 entire, I just pulled up the latest quarterly stat, but the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3030.4s	3030.4	 entire market cap of public US companies today stands at 47
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3036.4s	3036.4	 trillion dollars, the top 500 are about 38 trillion dollars. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3040.8s	3040.8	 you know, these private companies that are kind of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3042.6s	3042.6	 emerging tech companies are, you know, call it 10%, or, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3046.8s	3046.8	 8% of all public today of all public companies today. And, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3052.9s	3052.9	 know, it used to be the technology company started in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3056.0s	3056.0	 Silicon Valley, sold technology to traditional industries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3060.1s	3060.1	 What's happening in Silicon Valley today, and over the last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3063.0s	3063.0	 10 years or so, is that technology, quote unquote,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3066.0s	3066.0	 companies are becoming the next industrial companies, they are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3069.7s	3069.7	 replacing the profound insights, profound insights. And so this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3073.2s	3073.2	 like what we saw, you know, Airbnb is a hotel chain without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3076.3s	3076.3	 hotels. Uber is, you know, a transportation company without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3080.1s	3080.1	 vehicles, door dash door dash, but but even more importantly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3083.2s	3083.2	 there's an entire emergent class of life sciences companies of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3087.4s	3087.4	 novel hardware companies. And these businesses are leveraging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3090.6s	3090.6	 their core technology competence to create an advantage in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3094.9s	3094.9	 replacing an old model of doing industry. They're not selling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3098.2s	3098.2	 into the old school. And so I think that the you know, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3100.8s	3100.8	 people are freaking out about, you know, some of these big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3102.7s	3102.7	 investors like Tiger Global coming in and writing crazy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3105.1s	3105.1	 checks. If you take an index of the three and a half trillion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3108.8s	3108.8	 dollars today and said, you know what, these guys today are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3112.5s	3112.5	 going to be worth more than the $46 trillion market cap of all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3117.0s	3117.0	 the other public companies that sit today in the next 20 or 30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3119.9s	3119.9	 years. That's a pretty good way to kind of place your money over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3123.0s	3123.0	 a 30 year horizon. I'm going to go ahead and put as much money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3125.8s	3125.8	 as I can into the index of the private companies and expect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3128.9s	3128.9	 that they're going to be worth more than 46 trillion in 30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3131.1s	3131.1	 years. I'm going to make a 10 bagger. That's a retirement fund
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3133.6s	3133.6	 for my family. And so it makes a ton of sense, I think that these,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3137.6s	3137.6	 you know, these unicorns, given the advantages that are involved,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3140.6s	3140.6	 you know, kind of evolving from software and like sciences and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3143.3s	3143.3	 so on, do end up kind of playing out. It's going to be ugly. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3147.0s	3147.0	 that when what will happen is you'll end up seeing the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3148.8s	3148.8	 asymmetry, you'll see the like, oh, my gosh, it's something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3150.7s	3150.7	 that's 1000x, you know, 100x return, it'll become $100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3153.6s	3153.6	 billion public company or $200 billion public company. And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3156.4s	3156.4	 there'll be a bunch of them, they're going to die. And people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3158.7s	3158.7	 are going to focus on the depths and say this was overhyped, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3160.8s	3160.8	 bubble is over. But the reality is the index of companies today,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3164.0s	3164.0	 I would be willing to bet 20 to 30 years from now is worth more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3166.7s	3166.7	 than the $46 billion of all the companies. So Chamath, one of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3170.6s	3170.6	 the things we're seeing here, and you're playing a small part
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3173.2s	3173.2	 in it, or a large part, depending on who you talk to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3176.3s	3176.3	 We now have over 6000 publicly traded companies on US
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3179.6s	3179.6	 exchanges. We have less than 4000. We have about 3800.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3183.2s	3183.2	 Okay, no, we had 3600 in 2016. According to the research I have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3187.3s	3187.3	 here, according to markets, watch 6000 public trade companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3190.3s	3190.3	 in US exchanges. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3192.0s	3192.0	 counting the pink sheets and over the counter stuff, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3194.6s	3194.6	 we're seeing dramatically more publicly traded companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3199.0s	3199.0	 Many speculative ones or ones where you're getting to buy in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3202.5s	3202.5	 in year four, five or six, obviously, you're part of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3205.2s	3205.2	 with, you know, all the different IPO A's through what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3208.8s	3208.8	 are you up to now? What's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3210.7s	3210.7	 Yeah, we have six tech specs, we have four biotech specs, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3214.0s	3214.0	 know, I mean, I've started or invested in a bunch of others
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3217.2s	3217.2	 that have gone public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3218.9s	3218.9	 So let's look at this through the lens of the public markets as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3222.0s	3222.0	 well. My Mac review is exactly what Friedberg said, we are much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3226.0s	3226.0	 better off with as many technology companies being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3229.0s	3229.0	 birthed and being viable. Because over the long arc of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3233.0s	3233.0	 time, those companies will rebuild things that are today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3236.3s	3236.3	 inefficient and broken in a better way. And the world becomes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3240.9s	3240.9	 better. The question is, for a lot of people, well, what if the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3245.4s	3245.4	 wealth isn't better, because it's only you know, a fraction of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3249.4s	3249.4	 the number of people with a very specific skill set that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3251.7s	3251.7	 any other people don't have? That I think is a valid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3254.5s	3254.5	 argument. But then there's a different way to attack this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3257.1s	3257.1	 problem, which is you could actually do something really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3259.4s	3259.4	 meaningful around corporate interest rates and corporate tax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3263.2s	3263.2	 policy that would then get it right. So like even if those,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3267.4s	3267.4	 those 1000 companies, if you assume that that $3.4 trillion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3271.1s	3271.1	 dollars 10 x's that's 34 trillion of eventual market cap,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3274.3s	3274.3	 right? That's going to be supported by trillions of dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3276.8s	3276.8	 of earnings. But maybe those things only have a million or two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3280.0s	3280.0	 million employees, but there's 8 billion, eight, you know, odd
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3282.7s	3282.7	 people in the world. Well, the way you get the money into the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3285.3s	3285.3	 government's coffers so that they can reallocate it to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3287.5s	3287.5	 everybody that doesn't work at those 1000 companies is through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3290.6s	3290.6	 sensible tax policy that goes after the companies, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3295.2s	3295.2	 those companies will still do the job, right? It's not like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3298.0s	3298.0	 you're going to choose to not work at a, you know, world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3300.5s	3300.5	 beating startup in a mission that you care about because of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3303.8s	3303.8	 the corporate tax rate. Nobody's going to do that. Right? So I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3307.7s	3307.7	 think this is where like if you if you if you actually take a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3312.1s	3312.1	 step back and think of the bigger picture, the answer is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3314.1s	3314.1	 right in front of us, we just choose not to listen. This is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3316.2s	3316.2	 why you know, again, what Trump did was kind of stupid. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3319.0s	3319.0	 he focused on corporate tax policy, cutting it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3322.4s	3322.4	 unnecessarily. And now what we're doing is we're fighting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3325.6s	3325.6	 over tax policy. And part of the reason why this bill isn't going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3328.2s	3328.2	 to get passed is because of corporate tax policy and trying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3330.4s	3330.4	 to raise it again. But really, what we should do is actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3334.0s	3334.0	 raise it leave personal rates roughly where they are, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3336.5s	3336.5	 Elon even said, when asked by Kara Swisher this week, he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3340.3s	3340.3	 like, I paid 53% taxes. What about you? Yeah, it's going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3344.9s	3344.9	 57. And you know, 53 5761. Who cares? Sure. Whatever. And he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3350.9s	3350.9	 has to the point he made was listen, the ProPublica article
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3354.2s	3354.2	 was really disingenuous. They said he got a tax refund. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3358.5s	3358.5	 they didn't they never explained. Well, that's because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3361.5s	3361.5	 he overpaid his taxes massively the year before. So they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3364.2s	3364.2	 selectively pulling information. And the fact is, he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3368.2s	3368.2	 said, I will be the first money into SpaceX and Tesla, I'll be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3371.2s	3371.2	 the last money out. That is something we want more founders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3375.8s	3375.8	 to do, which is never sell their shares and be have more skin in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3379.4s	3379.4	 the game. Sorry, I'm sorry, I disagree with that. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3382.1s	3382.1	 that's a that's a bunch of fucking malarkey. Why? If you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3386.9s	3386.9	 choose to not sell, so be it. Okay, but look at the good that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3391.3s	3391.3	 Bill Gates has done by selling down Microsoft. So I mean, shouldn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3396.7s	3396.7	 exist. The Bill Gates Foundation shouldn't exist. No, no, no,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3399.6s	3399.6	 no, the reproductive protection, it had to be paid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3402.0s	3402.0	 some he did that when he hits 60 years old, I'm sure when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3405.5s	3405.5	 know, other no, he started to do it when he was 40 years old,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3408.4s	3408.4	 Jason, and he sold PayPal, and he was able to use that money to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3412.8s	3412.8	 reinvest in Tesla. I do think putting all the money back into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3417.0s	3417.0	 two companies that are solving two major issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3420.7s	3420.7	 He wouldn't have been able to do that if he hadn't sold in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3422.6s	3422.6	 first place. My point is, let's not conflate the problem. If you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3427.7s	3427.7	 generate wealth, I think that you should be bound morally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3432.5s	3432.5	 bound by society to put the money back to work. He chooses to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3436.9s	3436.9	 put the money back to work by reinvesting so aggressively into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3440.2s	3440.2	 the things that he's doing. That's laudable. Yeah, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3442.9s	3442.9	 that's virtuous. Yeah, I agree. But it's not the only way Bill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3446.4s	3446.4	 Gates took a different path, which is to basically take all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3448.8s	3448.8	 those profits, sell it down to then be able to go and put it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3452.1s	3452.1	 into the Gates Foundation. People will take multiple paths.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3455.0s	3455.0	 The point that's the same among all these people is there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3457.2s	3457.2	 moral obligation they feel to do the right thing for the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3460.6s	3460.6	 Then we're in agreement. So let's just celebrate that not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3463.0s	3463.0	 some tactical thing about buying and selling. One other point I'd
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3466.9s	3466.9	 make, Shamath, like you you said that, you know, we should tax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3470.0s	3470.0	 the wealth creation and distribute it. There's another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3473.2s	3473.2	 way to get that redistribution of wealth, which is to enable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3476.7s	3476.7	 access to the investments earlier by public pension funds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3481.1s	3481.1	 by the endowment, by the places where people by the retirement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3484.2s	3484.2	 funds, where, you know, a broader swath of the population,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3488.1s	3488.1	 you know, have savings sitting and change the accreditation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3491.0s	3491.0	 laws. We've historically kind of forced the narrative that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3494.0s	3494.0	 everyone in the United States needs to have a home and have 80
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3496.4s	3496.4	 90% of their wealth tied up in a piece of real estate. And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3499.2s	3499.2	 we end up with these massive kind of inflationary bubbles to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3501.5s	3501.5	 keep that value that book value kind of growing for them. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3504.5s	3504.5	 reality is if that money was put more productively into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3507.6s	3507.6	 building businesses via retirement funds that had access
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3510.7s	3510.7	 to venture capital, the public pension funds already do, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3513.6s	3513.6	 they should they probably under allocate the venture capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3515.8s	3515.8	 today, relative to where they're putting their endowments. Look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3519.7s	3519.7	 at the way, by the way, if that was the model, you wouldn't need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3522.6s	3522.6	 to tax right, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3523.4s	3523.4	 can buy the way one of the brilliant provisions in this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3526.0s	3526.0	 reconciliation bill is they're actually disallowing retirement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3529.6s	3529.6	 funds to invest in alternative assets, including startups and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3533.8s	3533.8	 insane venture capital insane. That is so wrong. So what? Yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3539.5s	3539.5	 what that is in there. They're taking pension funds and saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3544.3s	3544.3	 you can't have access to them. You as an individual through a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3549.8s	3549.8	 401k or IRA IRA cannot invest in alternative rule, right? Yes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3556.2s	3556.2	 partly in response to that. Well, they should just make it a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3558.5s	3558.5	 cap. Don't you think they should cap Peter Thiel's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3561.9s	3561.9	 I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3563.2s	3563.2	 that's why why cap anything who's this? It was against the spirit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3567.2s	3567.2	 of it. The spirit of the Roth was let's let's discuss this as a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3570.1s	3570.1	 specific issue. I'll I'll tee it up for you, sacks. Peter Thiel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3573.4s	3573.4	 put his Facebook stock in his Roth. And yeah, you're supposed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3577.6s	3577.6	 to get that tax free so you can have a great retirement. He did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3580.6s	3580.6	 that as an end run around paying taxes on the Facebook investment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3584.3s	3584.3	 that became worth billions of dollars reportedly. So now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3586.4s	3586.4	 they're saying you can have a Roth but anything above 50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3590.0s	3590.0	 billion, you got to pay tax on because the goal here isn't for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3593.0s	3593.0	 you to use it as a shelter against some massive venture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3597.5s	3597.5	 gains sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3599.2s	3599.2	 I don't have a huge problem with them putting a cap on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3601.8s	3601.8	 benefit of these accounts. However, my my issue with what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3605.6s	3605.6	 in the bill, there's a couple issues. One is like we said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3608.3s	3608.3	 they're disallowing investments and alternatives, which I just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3611.2s	3611.2	 think is bad for savers. Why would you want to do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3613.9s	3613.9	 Second, is the treatment of what happens when you exceed the cap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3618.7s	3618.7	 and right now what they're saying is you have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3620.6s	3620.6	 distribute out all of those funds and then subject the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3624.2s	3624.2	 subject them to immediate taxation at ordinary income
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3627.5s	3627.5	 rates, which is confiscatory because you could have made the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3631.1s	3631.1	 investment outside the retirement account and paid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3633.8s	3633.8	 locked long term cap gauge rates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3636.5s	3636.5	 If you do go over it should be long term tax, of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3639.0s	3639.0	 Yeah. And and furthermore, it's even worse than that. Because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3641.6s	3641.6	 what they're saying is, let's say that you do have an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3643.7s	3643.7	 alternative, like an investment in a start or a venture fund,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3647.6s	3647.6	 you have to distribute it out and pay tax on that, even though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3650.7s	3650.7	 that investment is not liquid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3652.4s	3652.4	 Right. So you should be able to take it out and just be treated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3654.7s	3654.7	 with normal cap gains and not have to liquidate it. Do you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3657.5s	3657.5	 think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3657.9s	3657.9	 Well, what it's going to do is, it's going to get it's going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3660.3s	3660.3	 give people an incentive, it's going to warp the incentives for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3662.6s	3662.6	 saving because what it's going to say to people is you want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3664.8s	3664.8	 do well, but not too well, right? Because if you hit the cap,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3668.2s	3668.2	 you're now subject to a confiscation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3670.0s	3670.0	 You get penalized. Yes, it should be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3672.9s	3672.9	 Yeah, exactly. I think the way it should work is you have a cap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3675.7s	3675.7	 at any distribution above that, you basically that becomes the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3678.8s	3678.8	 basis for future taxation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3680.6s	3680.6	 I think I think all of this can be summarized more simply, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3683.2s	3683.2	 think that we have, unfortunately gotten so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3686.8s	3686.8	 confused, that we've decided to fix the finish line and stagger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3692.0s	3692.0	 the starting line. Right? Because all of this still doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3695.1s	3695.1	 apply to rich people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3696.6s	3696.6	 No, this is vindictive against people. Rich people can do all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3699.6s	3699.6	 of these different things. They can set up these out of state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3702.1s	3702.1	 trusts, they can set up generation skipping trusts, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3704.5s	3704.5	 can be, you know, qualified investors, they can have QSBS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3709.1s	3709.1	 deductions. And so what this will do, unfortunately, is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3714.0s	3714.0	 entrenched the kind of wealth gains that Peter Thiel was able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3718.2s	3718.2	 to generate in a very visible way that will just piss everybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3721.8s	3721.8	 off. And I think instead, you got to go back to a different to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3727.0s	3727.0	 a different litmus test. So I, Jason, you have been the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3730.2s	3730.2	 strongest advocate for letting people participate in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3733.4s	3733.4	 economy. I have always agreed with that we need to figure out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3736.5s	3736.5	 how we can make sure that that that it isn't abused. But that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3741.0s	3741.0	 the best way is to educate financial literacy so that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3744.4s	3744.4	 can actually be a part of it. Even the starting line, let
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3747.3s	3747.3	 everybody be able to put stuff into this stuff and learn about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3750.1s	3750.1	 it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3750.6s	3750.6	 I mean, what Peter did essentially was put lottery
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3752.6s	3752.6	 tickets into his, you know, non tax retirement fund lottery
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3756.1s	3756.1	 tickets being buying stocks in private companies early. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3759.8s	3759.8	 regular Americans aren't allowed to do that. So rather than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3762.3s	3762.3	 retroactively try to penalize Peter because you disagree with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3765.8s	3765.8	 his politics, or because he did it too well. I think it's better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3769.6s	3769.6	 that everybody be allowed to be an accredited investor and do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3771.8s	3771.8	 what Peter did, which is everybody should be able to take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3774.3s	3774.3	 their 401k or their Roth and be able to buy the next LinkedIn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3778.0s	3778.0	 Uber. So if you were a civilian, and you took an Uber, or you use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3781.9s	3781.9	 LinkedIn to hire somebody in year two, and you had an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3785.2s	3785.2	 opportunity to buy those shares, you should be allowed to buy it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3787.6s	3787.6	 because you're a human resources person or Uber driver, and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3790.2s	3790.2	 realize, this is a great service that will change the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3792.3s	3792.3	 Doesn't take a genius to figure that out. freeburg. Yeah, look, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3795.6s	3795.6	 mean, the downside is you see speculative concentrated bets that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3800.3s	3800.3	 white people out. That's the reason the protective provisions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3803.4s	3803.4	 are in there. So I think there are probably sensible ways of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3806.5s	3806.5	 managing that, you know, around, you know, qualifying, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3812.5s	3812.5	 pools of these investments in a way creating indexes against
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3816.2s	3816.2	 them, etc. And maybe that's the right way to provide access. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3819.9s	3819.9	 you know, giving individuals that maybe, you know, don't have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3824.4s	3824.4	 the right kind of point of view on a particular investment, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3827.7s	3827.7	 ability to put all of their capital into that investment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3831.2s	3831.2	 Generally, I would say go for it. The problem is we've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3834.4s	3834.4	 socialized, you know, protection, right? So and this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3838.4s	3838.4	 is the same with health care. In a model for governing or model
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3842.6s	3842.6	 for a state where you provide socialized care for people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3845.9s	3845.9	 through health care, socialized health care, or you provide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3848.5s	3848.5	 socialized support for people through, you know, the social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3851.7s	3851.7	 security system and other services like that. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3854.8s	3854.8	 difficult to say, okay, the government's going to be your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3857.0s	3857.0	 backstop, and it's going to provide the support for you. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3860.1s	3860.1	 we're also going to let you take risky behavior. And that's where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3863.4s	3863.4	 I think the two have to go hand in hand. If you want to get rid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3866.4s	3866.4	 of one, you got to get rid of the other. And so because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3869.4s	3869.4	 otherwise, we all end up paying the cost of the person that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3871.8s	3871.8	 takes the you know, outsized risk, and then we all end up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3875.2s	3875.2	 having to foot the bill for that person taking that risk. So if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3877.6s	3877.6	 we're all going to be there to protect that person, we have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3879.9s	3879.9	 tell them you can't take unnecessary risks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3882.4s	3882.4	 Okay, hey, sax, let me ask you a conspiracy theory here. Peter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3888.3s	3888.3	 teal supported Trump when Trump was teetering on the Access
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3894.6s	3894.6	 Hollywood tape, and he went to bat for him, he gave him a big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3898.8s	3898.8	 donation at that time, then obviously did the Republican
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3901.5s	3901.5	 National Convention, and was a key intellectual influencer in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3906.2s	3906.2	 his election plan. Now the Democrats are in, and suddenly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3911.3s	3911.3	 the focus becomes this one outsized Roth IRA, and we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3914.5s	3914.5	 going to rewrite the law so that Peter teal has to take $5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3918.6s	3918.6	 billion or so is one of the estimates that I saw online on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3922.0s	3922.0	 CNBC out of his IRA. Do you think this is specific
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3925.9s	3925.9	 vindictiveness on the part of the Democrats to try to attack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3931.6s	3931.6	 specifically Peter teal? I know he's your bestie. Well, yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3934.5s	3934.5	 it does feel and I'm not I'm not a Peter teal apologist, but this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3937.1s	3937.1	 feels vindictive and personal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3939.6s	3939.6	 So yes and no. Okay, so what I would say is there have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3942.7s	3942.7	 proposals over the last I think going back to maybe even 2014
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3946.7s	3946.7	 on providing some restrictions or caps on, you know, these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3951.9s	3951.9	 these IRAs and the Roth IRAs. However, there's never been a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3955.6s	3955.6	 proposal as punitive and retroactive and confiscatory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3960.2s	3960.2	 That's what they're doing here. And specifically, it's the fact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3963.1s	3963.1	 that they're going to force Peter to distribute out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3966.7s	3966.7	 everything above the cap, and then tax it as ordinary income. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3970.5s	3970.5	 mean, that that's just changing the rules. That part, I think is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3974.5s	3974.5	 directed at Peter and I've actually heard that staffers on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3978.1s	3978.1	 Capitol Hill are calling this the Peter teal provision. So let
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3981.3s	3981.3	 me just confirm that part for you. So what I would say is I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3984.9s	3984.9	 think there is a sensible way to provide some restrictions on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3988.7s	3988.7	 these retirement accounts, but the way they're doing it is so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3991.6s	3991.6	 punitive. I think it is motivated by political revenge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3995.2s	3995.2	 against Peter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3996.0s	3996.0	 Chamath, what do we think of the number of unicorns being created
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=3999.6s	3999.6	 in the private markets? Obviously, when a company hits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4002.0s	4002.0	 unicorn status, I think they're going to start buzzing around and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4004.8s	4004.8	 maybe knocking on your door and stacks and boards might start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4007.8s	4007.8	 thinking about that. These companies sometimes have $10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4011.4s	4011.4	 million, $30 million in revenue, $50 million in revenue, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4015.4s	4015.4	 they're becoming worth a billion dollars. Do these valuations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4017.7s	4017.7	 make sense writ large? And are you concerned that this is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4020.8s	4020.8	 bubble?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4022.1s	4022.1	 I don't think there's a bubble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4023.6s	4023.6	 Okay. Explain why there's not a bubble in early stage private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4026.8s	4026.8	 companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4027.5s	4027.5	 Well, I think it's because of what we just talked about, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4030.4s	4030.4	 is that these companies, by and large, are growing at incredibly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4035.4s	4035.4	 fast rates, and they are replacing legacy incumbents that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4039.8s	4039.8	 are growing very slowly or not at all. With and who have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4044.8s	4044.8	 basically won for a long time with inferior products. And so as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4048.9s	4048.9	 these superior products with more nimble organizations get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4053.2s	4053.2	 capitalized to go to market, they're just going to win. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4056.2s	4056.2	 so I think what we're seeing is a wholesale replacement of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4059.4s	4059.4	 economy from the old to the new. And so that's why these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4063.2s	4063.2	 companies will do well. And I think it's going to be a really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4068.2s	4068.2	 powerful force in the world, because like the world should be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4072.0s	4072.0	 a little bit more efficient and fairer, when you have all this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4075.9s	4075.9	 modern technology working on your behalf. So I'm a real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4080.2s	4080.2	 supporter of all of this, I think there's going to be even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4082.5s	4082.5	 more. And I think, you know, the the thing that we have to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4085.4s	4085.4	 comfortable with is whenever something goes from a fringe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4088.2s	4088.2	 thing, which is what venture capital was, Jason, when all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4090.7s	4090.7	 us were, you know, first in Silicon Valley 20 years ago, to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4095.5s	4095.5	 you know, today in 2021, we're sitting here, this is going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4099.7s	4099.7	 become a fundamental part of the economy. And when that happens,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4103.8s	4103.8	 there'll be more and more money, the returns won't be as good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4107.3s	4107.3	 That'll be okay. But there'll be a lot of progress. And so you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4110.1s	4110.1	 know, we're going through the same transition that private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4112.7s	4112.7	 equity did in the 80s and 90s, that venture that hedge funds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4116.1s	4116.1	 you see all the different venture capitalists who are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4118.4s	4118.4	 retiring Bajan from spark. The kid from Lightspeed, bunch of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4123.6s	4123.6	 other folks, obviously, our friend, Bill Gurley is stepping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4125.8s	4125.8	 back. Jeremy, he's 50. Yeah, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4130.2s	4130.2	 way. Am I doing something wrong here? I'm like busy creating a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4133.0s	4133.0	 venture firm at age almost 50. You're on the wrong side of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4137.1s	4137.1	 distribution. What are we things behind this? They just made too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4140.3s	4140.3	 much money in their money? Or is it because it's too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4143.0s	4143.0	 competitive now? They're moving to Wyoming. I would say it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4146.4s	4146.4	 slightly different than this. I don't know. I don't know. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4149.8s	4149.8	 mean, I know all of those guys. But I don't know what their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4152.8s	4152.8	 motivation is. But what I would say is I tend to think that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4157.1s	4157.1	 mindset of venture has a relatively short half life. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4161.3s	4161.3	 I think it's about 15 years. Why I think that there is a and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4166.6s	4166.6	 because, you know, company building is roughly a 10 year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4169.4s	4169.4	 arc, you know, like when you get into something early. And so I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4173.6s	4173.6	 think that there is like a newness whenever you start, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4176.1s	4176.1	 don't think it matters what your age is. And then there is this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4181.4s	4181.4	 sort of like a death march that sets in by year eight or nine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4189.7s	4189.7	 And then you try to see it through to returning the capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4193.3s	4193.3	 and making sure all the employees and founders you've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4196.8s	4196.8	 been invested with land the ship. And I think what these guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4200.5s	4200.5	 did was get to that place and say, Okay, I've had this 15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4203.6s	4203.6	 year beautiful arc. Do I want to do another 15 year arc and for a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4208.2s	4208.2	 lot of people, it won't make much sense. And then also, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4211.7s	4211.7	 think your patience to do it goes away. Yes, because it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4214.4s	4214.4	 like, you guys know what it's exhausting. It is exhausting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4218.9s	4218.9	 The amount of drama I'm dealing with right now in my portfolio
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4222.4s	4222.4	 is bonkers. The the the bad I don't know if you're seeing the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4226.0s	4226.0	 sex, but the amount of shenanigans bad behavior, fraud,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4230.1s	4230.1	 lying backstabbing is at an all time high. That would be your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4233.5s	4233.5	 portfolio, Jacob. Yeah, no, it's literally three companies. I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4238.0s	4238.0	 literally dealing with three companies with drama out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4240.0s	4240.0	 350. I think it's one out of 100 is probably fine. But I am
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4244.1s	4244.1	 seeing all kinds of shenanigans even in the diligence phase. I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4247.3s	4247.3	 seeing it. I'm at something more tactical, which is like, for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4250.5s	4250.5	 example, you know, yesterday, we're starting something really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4254.0s	4254.0	 ambitious in batteries. And I have to sit there for an hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4257.6s	4257.6	 And we have to go through ordering the equipment, setting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4260.2s	4260.2	 up the lab getting human resource. And there's only so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4263.7s	4263.7	 much of that that you have the energy to do after a certain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4266.8s	4266.8	 amount of time. It's important work. You have to do it right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4270.9s	4270.9	 But it feels a little low leverage. Now for that CEO, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4276.3s	4276.3	 everything. And so you have to be on top of your game to help
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4279.3s	4279.3	 that person. And I think this is where I appreciate their honesty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4284.0s	4284.0	 in basically saying, guys, I don't have that level of detailed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4289.0s	4289.0	 focus in me anymore. And that's important, because in a next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4292.0s	4292.0	 generation of folks who want to put in that 15 year journey, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4294.8s	4294.8	 need somebody committed, you need somebody who's super
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4296.6s	4296.6	 committed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4297.2s	4297.2	 Yeah, and I do think there's a difference between being a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4300.1s	4300.1	 partner in a large partnership, where you kind of have your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4303.7s	4303.7	 portfolio of companies and, you know, to Chamath's point, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4307.0s	4307.0	 going to be on that arc with them. And then kind of building a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4310.3s	4310.3	 firm from scratch, where like, quite frankly, I would go crazy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4314.2s	4314.2	 the way that, you know, you're dealing with Jason and Chamath
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4317.4s	4317.4	 is saying, I would get burned out if I didn't have a team. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4320.4s	4320.4	 we now have like a pretty big team.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4322.4s	4322.4	 How many?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4323.4s	4323.4	 Well, just on the investment team, I think we've got about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4325.8s	4325.8	 15 people and, and then we now have a bunch of operating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4328.7s	4328.7	 partners. So, you know, we were looking at what Andreessen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4331.2s	4331.2	 Horowitz has done with services, you know, we had this big debate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4333.5s	4333.5	 in the venture community for a long time about whether the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4336.2s	4336.2	 venture firm should operate, it should offer services and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4338.4s	4338.4	 operating partners. And Andreessen, you know, went hog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4341.5s	4341.5	 wild with that they've got like 200 people doing it. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4343.9s	4343.9	 think they've proven that it works in the sense I don't, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4347.1s	4347.1	 know, it's not totally clear how much value they're delivering,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4349.4s	4349.4	 but it clearly works in the sense that founders would like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4352.5s	4352.5	 the services if they can get them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4354.2s	4354.2	 It creates marketing, but it may not be necessary. It's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4357.2s	4357.2	 It's great marketing. So if you're a great founder, when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4359.4s	4359.4	 were a great founder, you wouldn't want Andreessen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4360.8s	4360.8	 Horowitz telling you how to run your HR and doing your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4363.0s	4363.0	 marketing for you at Yammer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4364.6s	4364.6	 Right. But so what we've done is what we've done is focus on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4368.3s	4368.3	 bringing on not 200 people, but an expert in every functional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4371.6s	4371.6	 area that a SaaS company might need, because you do want access
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4374.8s	4374.8	 to an expert. When you're set up the department, you want to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4377.4s	4377.4	 talk to the digital marketing person or the legal person or,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4380.7s	4380.7	 you know, or you know, we have an executive briefing center
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4383.3s	4383.3	 now. So we do believe that there is a version of the services
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4386.2s	4386.2	 model that makes a lot of sense. And we are building that if I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4388.6s	4388.6	 had to do all of that value add myself, yeah, I would I would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4392.1s	4392.1	 burn out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4392.7s	4392.7	 Yeah, I mean, I think it's a very good point. I literally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4394.8s	4394.8	 last week launched the syndicate.com slash slash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4398.2s	4398.2	 syndicate, just for the same reason. So I can build a group
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4401.2s	4401.2	 of individuals who are focused just on that, and who have that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4404.6s	4404.6	 domain expertise. But they're the great founders do not want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4408.6s	4408.6	 you up in their business. So I I'm concerned with, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4412.5s	4412.5	 that's why we have like, kind of we call it a teach them how to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4414.8s	4414.8	 fish model where we don't want to do the work, we want to give
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4417.6s	4417.6	 them an expert as a resource, who can meet with them, show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4420.4s	4420.4	 them show them some best practices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4422.5s	4422.5	 People coming to you expecting you to do the work is that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4424.8s	4424.8	 what I know happens sometimes is they're like, although can you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4427.4s	4427.4	 find us a developer? And I'm like, No, but I can talk to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4430.6s	4430.6	 about finding developers, but I don't have a recruiter on staff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4433.8s	4433.8	 Do you have a recruit? Yeah, we actually do now we have three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4435.9s	4435.9	 recruiters on staff. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4437.6s	4437.6	 you're paying a half million dollars a year to recruit for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4441.0s	4441.0	 your companies. That's a basically, basically, that's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4443.6s	4443.6	 big advantage. Is it working? Are you actually landing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4446.0s	4446.0	 developers? Yeah, I mean, look, we can't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4447.8s	4447.8	 free broken, I don't give a fuck about any of this. This is us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4451.1s	4451.1	 in the weeds. You want to talk about some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4452.9s	4452.9	 Okay, well, just up level for a second. I just want to go back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4456.3s	4456.3	 to this like golden era point when we're talking about venture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4458.8s	4458.8	 capital, because, look, obviously, in the weeds, we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4462.4s	4462.4	 going to talk about our problems. But I really think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4465.7s	4465.7	 that what's happening here with 1000 new unicorns being minted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4468.8s	4468.8	 every year is just unbelievable. If you look at the number of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4472.4s	4472.4	 billionaires in the US, I just googled this, there were 614
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4476.4s	4476.4	 billionaires in the US as of October 2020. Now there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4478.9s	4478.9	 probably more I don't know, let's say there's 1000. Well, if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4481.7s	4481.7	 you're minting 1000 new unicorns every year, how many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4484.4s	4484.4	 billionaires is that creating? I mean, how many millionaires?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4486.7s	4486.7	 More importantly, how many people who are making 50 to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4489.8s	4489.8	 $250,000 a year before they join the ecosystem and now worth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4493.0s	4493.0	 millions will buy homes, hire people start the next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4495.7s	4495.7	 But let me just give you guys the counterpoint to that, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4498.4s	4498.4	 I'm not necessarily arguing, but I'm this is what I think the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4501.0s	4501.0	 narrative is, which is that those businesses that are kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4503.9s	4503.9	 of, you know, accumulating wealth and accumulating revenue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4507.8s	4507.8	 are effectively destroying the old economy and shutting down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4510.9s	4510.9	 companies and shutting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4511.8s	4511.8	 There's 11 million job openings. That's bullshit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4514.5s	4514.5	 I don't I don't believe it's a zero sum game. Yeah, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4517.2s	4517.2	 there's it's, it's creative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4519.4s	4519.4	 It is disruptive, right? So there is a there is kind of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4521.4s	4521.4	 temporal flux. And there's a flux of people across from the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4524.5s	4524.5	 old economy to the new economy. And it's that flux that I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4527.5s	4527.5	 creates the great uncertainty and the great heartache that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4530.4s	4530.4	 everyone's trying to solve for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4531.5s	4531.5	 That's the hand wringing. That's the hand wringing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4532.6s	4532.6	 This is why it is so important to get corporate taxation right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4536.3s	4536.3	 Because if you're going to replace GDP dollar for dollar,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4540.6s	4540.6	 don't focus on the fewer employees that work there, focus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4543.8s	4543.8	 on the largest number possible, which is the revenue that these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4546.8s	4546.8	 employees are helping to generate for these companies. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4549.8s	4549.8	 if you had much, much higher corporate taxation, you can play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4553.0s	4553.0	 around with all the personal taxation you want. But if a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4555.6s	4555.6	 of people do get shut out of the economy, you're not going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4558.5s	4558.5	 make nearly as much for the government as you would by taxing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4562.3s	4562.3	 companies more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4563.4s	4563.4	 Chamath, should there be a backstop? Because we know tax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4566.8s	4566.8	 law is so sophisticated. And if you're intelligent, you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4570.6s	4570.6	 make it seem like you didn't make any money because you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4572.4s	4572.4	 investing, you're distributing, yada, yada. Should there just be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4575.6s	4575.6	 a hey, listen, whatever you want to do with your taxes is fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4578.1s	4578.1	 But x percent of your top line revenue is your base tax, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4583.5s	4583.5	 you cannot get around that. Should there be something like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4586.0s	4586.0	 that? There's a couple things that this tax bill attempted to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4588.6s	4588.6	 do, which could be really powerful if it does get passed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4592.2s	4592.2	 I think that corporations should pay a large tax. I think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4595.6s	4595.6	 they should be forced to spend a certain percentage on R&D. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4599.4s	4599.4	 I think they should be forced to spend a certain percentage on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4602.2s	4602.2	 basically benefits for their employees. And I think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4606.4s	4606.4	 would do a lot to level the playing field. Then I do think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4610.4s	4610.4	 that you can have much higher individual taxation, but you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4614.0s	4614.0	 need to make it simpler because there's too many easy ways, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4618.1s	4618.1	 that ProPublica article showed for you to play games for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4621.5s	4621.5	 individuals to not pay taxes. And so you got to simplify all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4626.4s	4626.4	 this stuff because it's too complicated. So if you're rich
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4628.7s	4628.7	 enough to hire a fleet of lawyers, you will work your way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4632.4s	4632.4	 around it. Yes. Period.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4635.4s	4635.4	 And they repealed it as part of the EMT was for corporations was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4640.0s	4640.0	 repealed as part of the tax cuts and jobs act, I think I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4644.1s	4644.1	 know where that stands. But it does seem like a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4646.5s	4646.5	 companies. I don't know how that makes sense. J Cal. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4649.2s	4649.2	 like some businesses run high margins, some are low margins,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4652.0s	4652.0	 some are losing money, some are overinvesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4653.8s	4653.8	 Complicated. I don't have the solution. That's why I'm sort
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4655.8s	4655.8	 of saying, well, one of the I think one of the optics issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4659.0s	4659.0	 here is, you know, people are like, that company didn't pay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4661.1s	4661.1	 any taxes. That company sells this many iPhones that companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4664.4s	4664.4	 Yes, because they're they're doing what tax laws were

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4670.2s	4670.2	 How do you fix it? Give me a solution for your bird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4672.4s	4672.4	 I think that once businesses are mature, and they start dividend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4675.4s	4675.4	 cash and making distributions, and they're profitable, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4677.8s	4677.8	 might be the time to tax them. I'm not sure they ever do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4680.4s	4680.4	 If they had an army of people saying, hey, you don't have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4682.8s	4682.8	 you don't want to, because if they're investing in growth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4685.1s	4685.1	 they're creating jobs and they're growing the economy. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4687.2s	4687.2	 that's what we said, as well as fine. I don't think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4689.4s	4689.4	 reading as many jobs as you think, but they are growing the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4691.9s	4691.9	 economy. That's why you have to tax the corporation, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4694.4s	4694.4	 that's the effective proxy for taxing GDP.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4697.4s	4697.4	 Yeah, look, I would be all about just, I'll wear my libertarian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4702.1s	4702.1	 hat again for a second. But like, I would be all about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4704.5s	4704.5	 taxation, if I felt like my dollars had a positive ROI,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4707.5s	4707.5	 where they ended up. And the problem right now is like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4710.0s	4710.0	 government spending is set up in such a way that it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4712.4s	4712.4	 effectively been gamified, and people extract capital from the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4715.2s	4715.2	 government. And my dollars are not getting a positive ROI for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4718.4s	4718.4	 me or for society, I would rather have them sit somewhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4720.7s	4720.7	 else. Let's be honest, that's why you left San Francisco. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4723.3s	4723.3	 mean, it's just spending more. I left San Francisco, I've got a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4726.0s	4726.0	 family and I and I need a backyard. So that's a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4728.7s	4728.7	 different. But isn't part of it that you are a separate degree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4732.2s	4732.2	 of incompetence. But like, but yes, you're spending more than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4734.9s	4734.9	 ever. And it's getting worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4736.9s	4736.9	 San Francisco is a whole nother a whole nother nightmare. J Cal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4739.3s	4739.3	 Well, like, I'm just speaking in general, when you're at large,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4741.8s	4741.8	 in general, right now, whether it's the state level or the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4744.9s	4744.9	 federal level, it feels to me, and I think it feels to a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4747.9s	4747.9	 people, that dollars aren't being spent in a way that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4751.0s	4751.0	 generating a return for the taxpayer. And I think we all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4754.4s	4754.4	 feel that way. And I think that's what's frustrating. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4756.3s	4756.3	 not about how much one's being taxed. It's about how are those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4759.2s	4759.2	 tax dollars being spent? And are they being spent in a way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4762.2s	4762.2	 that secures the future of our nation of our people of our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4765.4s	4765.4	 livelihoods, etc. And making, you know, giving everyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4768.6s	4768.6	 access to opportunity. What's happened? What's happened? What's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4770.9s	4770.9	 happened is we've created things like student loan programs, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4774.2s	4774.2	 you know, housing programs and infrastructure programs that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4777.7s	4777.7	 literally just giving away money to private companies that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4780.2s	4780.2	 profiteering off of government spending, right? And it's crony
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4783.2s	4783.2	 capital as our favorite professor Scott Galloway says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4786.2s	4786.2	 it's one thing I really do agree with him on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4787.9s	4787.9	 Pressual politics?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4788.6s	4788.6	 It is it is that there is this notion of crony capitals and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4792.0s	4792.0	 where the United States and state governments, even local
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4794.9s	4794.9	 governments as seen in San Francisco, California, all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4796.9s	4796.9	 way up to the federal level, are spending money in a way that I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4799.8s	4799.8	 think we all feel is benefiting some disproportionately to most.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4804.6s	4804.6	 Now, if there was a high degree of taxation, and everyone was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4807.6s	4807.6	 benefited in a meaningful way, and those programs were well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4809.8s	4809.8	 managed, and capital flowed meaningfully to, to support
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4813.2s	4813.2	 everything we want to support, great, I think everyone would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4815.6s	4815.6	 raise their hand raise two hands and say tax the heck out of me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4818.1s	4818.1	 Let's make that happen. But that's not what happens. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4820.4s	4820.4	 think that's the primary aversion to high taxation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4823.7s	4823.7	 Sacks, you get the final word?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4825.2s	4825.2	 Yeah, I mean, look, I what I'm worried about is taxes are going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4828.3s	4828.3	 up big time, no matter what happens in Washington. Spending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4831.6s	4831.6	 is going up big time, we now have peacetime deficits that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4835.4s	4835.4	 the biggest that they've ever been the deaths that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4839.2s	4839.2	 national debt, the peacetime national debt, the highest ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4842.0s	4842.0	 been. We have a looming debt crisis in China, we have supply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4846.4s	4846.4	 chain shortages. What could go on? I mean, you know, what I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4850.6s	4850.6	 there's a lot of things here that could upset the apple cart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4853.4s	4853.4	 And I what I'm afraid of is we're going to look back at this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4856.6s	4856.6	 year, the 1000 unicorns being minted and say that really was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4860.1s	4860.1	 the golden era and everything happened. And after that, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4862.9s	4862.9	 really screwed you said like the old guy at Starbucks, it says
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4865.6s	4865.6	 that every generation and complains about the last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4867.7s	4867.7	 generation golden era and it's all down. How much does music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4870.3s	4870.3	 suck today? Normally, normally, I will say how impressive it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4873.6s	4873.6	 that 10 years ago, none of those unicorns existed. And it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4876.8s	4876.8	 is likely the case that $3 trillion of value was created
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4880.2s	4880.2	 via private funding and private companies over the last 10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4882.6s	4882.6	 years. So all these entrepreneurs, all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4885.0s	4885.0	 employees, anyone working at these businesses, anyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4886.9s	4886.9	 involved in these businesses should be thrilled about the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4889.2s	4889.2	 fact that you from zero created three and a half trillion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4891.9s	4891.9	 dollars of value in 10 years. That's extraordinary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4894.6s	4894.6	 Yeah, I'm not I'm not trying to create nostalgia about the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4897.2s	4897.2	 past. I'm talking about the present and trying to preserve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4899.8s	4899.8	 it because I'm seeing some storm clouds on the horizon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=4902.3s	4902.3	 Yeah, yeah, I would like to play the best song from Tony Tony

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5081.3s	5081.3	 what is it I want to invert the top down hierarchy to what I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5086.1s	5086.1	 want to be a left wing authoritarian.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5089.2s	5089.2	 That is what you are a left wing authoritarian.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5101.9s	5101.9	 to the points we're talking about with Coinbase earlier, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5104.7s	5104.7	 you know, we have these conferences in the tech industry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5107.8s	5107.8	 and they're frankly run by people who hate tech and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5112.3s	5112.3	 tech industry. And they're successful tickets. Right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5116.4s	5116.4	 exactly. And so the I see these tech founders going up on these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5119.7s	5119.7	 stages and subjecting themselves these interrogations by people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5123.4s	5123.4	 who hate them. And I'm like, what are they doing? Like, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5126.1s	5126.1	 makes no sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5127.3s	5127.3	 I'm putting up a form I'm going to let people take deposits, I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5129.9s	5129.9	 going to pick a month, and we're going to go how many people went
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5132.5s	5132.5	 to the conference guys you went to this week?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5134.0s	5134.0	 I the code conference I think was probably three or 400 by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5137.6s	5137.6	 design. It was a third or half.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5140.3s	5140.3	 How much tickets?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5142.2s	5142.2	 I didn't actually buy a ticket because I didn't want to be in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5144.6s	5144.6	 the conference itself. Because I was concerned about a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5147.0s	5147.0	 breakthrough virus. But I did host the poker game with sky and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5149.4s	5149.4	 Brooke. tickets I think are 8000 for code. And I think Ted is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5153.4s	5153.4	 up to 10 or 15. So maybe how much are we charging me like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5156.2s	5156.2	 $25,000,000? 7500. We're charging 7500. So 200 tickets and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5161.0s	5161.0	 then 50 scholarships for people who wouldn't be able to afford
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5163.6s	5163.6	 it. So the gross revenue here is we want 1.5 million. So what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5168.3s	5168.3	 our cost going to be? Cost will be a million. And what so wait,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5172.0s	5172.0	 so we're so we're making profit on this deal. I'm making a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5174.6s	5174.6	 profit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5178.6s	5178.6	 We spend maybe very clear, excuse me, excuse me, what we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5181.8s	5181.8	 make I am buying the wine and you will shut the fuck up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5187.0s	5187.0	 Okay, so then it's gonna be it's gonna cost 2 million. So it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5190.0s	5190.0	 gonna make 1.5 No, no, no, no. No, it's gonna do me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5193.9s	5193.9	 I want I want a wine budget so that everybody that comes is it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5198.1s	5198.1	 feels like they've had an exceptional food and beverage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5200.6s	5200.6	 experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5201.6s	5201.6	 And half a million dollars on wine, no joke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5203.8s	5203.8	 So then it has to be 10k a ticket. But you know what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5206.3s	5206.3	 people who are coming can afford it. They don't take out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5208.0s	5208.0	 we're not privileging you with some profiteering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5211.0s	5211.0	 I'm not profiteering off of it. Honestly, the reason I want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5213.1s	5213.1	 do it most is I want to play poker for three days. And I want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5216.4s	5216.4	 to have us the four of us interview the most iconoclastic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5220.6s	5220.6	 interesting people. And I want to do it for the fans so that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5223.7s	5223.7	 some number of fans get to come who wouldn't normally be able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5226.0s	5226.0	 come to a conference at this level. And I think it would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5229.1s	5229.1	 a blast. It'd be fun to get together. Okay, stop talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5231.4s	5231.4	 about it and do it. We're all okay, I'll do it. All right. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5233.2s	5233.2	 just want to make sure everybody's bought in. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6qfxJZpno&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=86&t=5234.6s	5234.6	 so to get you fuckers on a date, a date. I'll set a date.
