https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=121.7s	121.7	 dinner party. And then a couple of glasses of wine in and then

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=135.9s	135.9	 everyone out lock up. And then by the end of the night, it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=138.5s	138.5	 like, you know what, let's go in the room and just play poker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=140.2s	140.2	 and give each other COVID. They got to acceptance. They got to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=142.6s	142.6	 accept this. They went through the whole emotional cycle of the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=160.2s	160.2	 update, like, oh, I see today. I still test a positive. He's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=165.5s	165.5	 showing his positive test.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=167.5s	167.5	 I was doing that. My superfans, my stands were concerned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=172.3s	172.3	 It's the only good test result Jake has ever had. Yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=176.4s	176.4	 it's the only positive that's true.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=194.3s	194.3	 Elizabeth Holmes has been found guilty on four counts of fraud

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=202.4s	202.4	 be I understand served concurrently. Most people I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=206.0s	206.0	 think you're speculating four to 10 years, and then I think you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=209.0s	209.0	 can get 15% off for good behavior. Again, I'm no expert
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=212.7s	212.7	 on that. But that's what I read. guilty counts were two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=215.6s	215.6	 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=217.7s	217.7	 fraud. She was originally charged with a total of 11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=219.7s	219.7	 counts of fraud. Four were guilty for were not guilty. Three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=223.5s	223.5	 were a split verdict. The jury said they were unable to come to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=226.4s	226.4	 a unanimous, unanimous verdict on three of the counts after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=230.6s	230.6	 more than 45 hours of deliberation quote from the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=233.2s	233.2	 Wall Street Journal article juries were persuaded that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=235.3s	235.3	 Miss Holmes conspired to defraud investors. This outcome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=238.2s	238.2	 could be significant because it means hundreds of millions of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=240.4s	240.4	 dollars of there are no investors that there are no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=243.4s	243.4	 investors lost could be taken into consideration during her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=246.2s	246.2	 sentencing. His big numbers, the jury was split, however, on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=249.5s	249.5	 which of the six investors who testified were defrauded the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=252.7s	252.7	 jurors convicted Miss Holmes on three counts. These included $100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=256.4s	256.4	 million from the family office of former education, education,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=265.3s	265.3	 anyway, thoughts on the legal technicalities of the case
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=271.8s	271.8	 counselor sex. Well, we've talked about this before. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=274.4s	274.4	 mean, I think so at the end of the day, she was convicted on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=277.2s	277.2	 the counts related to deceiving investors. She was not on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=280.7s	280.7	 counts related to patients. I think that makes sense in that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=284.4s	284.4	 her obligations to investors are very clear. Whereas I think the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=289.4s	289.4	 patient related duties are I mean, she had them, but it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=292.6s	292.6	 little bit less clear. So I mean, look, it's what we've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=295.3s	295.3	 always said here. As a founder, you can be as messianic as you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=300.3s	300.3	 want to be you can promise, you know, anything about your vision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=305.0s	305.0	 and what you intended to the future, but what you must do is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=307.8s	307.8	 be accurate about the current state of your business, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=311.6s	311.6	 cannot lie about the deals that you've made about the current
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=316.7s	316.7	 capabilities of your product. And she was putting, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=320.7s	320.7	 logos of customers she didn't have in her deck, she was lying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=324.4s	324.4	 about the military being a customer. So she simply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=328.0s	328.0	 exactly misrepresented where she was at that time at the when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=333.3s	333.3	 these investors invested and that was the red line she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=336.2s	336.2	 should not have crossed. And I think in that sense, it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=339.3s	339.3	 pretty simple case. I think, you know, the part of this, again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=343.0s	343.0	 you know, the piece of this that's interesting, is not the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=347.0s	347.0	 case itself, but really the media coverage, because the media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=350.4s	350.4	 wants to portray this case as an indictment of Silicon Valley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=355.4s	355.4	 And the thing you keep hearing over and over again, none of us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=358.8s	358.8	 were involved. Well, it just factually Yes, exactly. We
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=362.8s	362.8	 weren't involved. But what you said, there's not a single
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=365.4s	365.4	 person in Silicon Valley, I think, who put in a single
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=367.8s	367.8	 shackle into this thing, who actually does this as a real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=370.6s	370.6	 job, Tim Draper. Well, she doesn't put in a little bit of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=374.4s	374.4	 money as an angel. And then he didn't put a single dollar in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=377.0s	377.0	 after that. I'm saying, you know, you didn't come to social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=379.4s	379.4	 capital or graph ventures or to Sequoia or to TPB or to Google
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=383.3s	383.3	 to raise money for this thing. None of that happened. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=386.6s	386.6	 Sachs is right, like the summary of the Wall Street Journal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=390.2s	390.2	 Nick, you can post it because I put it in the group chat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=392.9s	392.9	 basically summarize the fraud and is exactly what Sachs says
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=395.8s	395.8	 she affixed a logo of specifically, I think it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=398.1s	398.1	 Pfizer that had not validated their own assist technology in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=401.7s	401.7	 materials she presented to investors. So she's basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=403.8s	403.8	 like Pfizer said this is a go. And apparently that wasn't true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=407.7s	407.7	 She gave the false impression that the devices were used by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=410.2s	410.2	 the US military. That's what got all these military folks to sign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=413.2s	413.2	 on board and support it. That wasn't true. And then and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=417.6s	417.6	 she the biggest coup was that she signed a deal with Walgreens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=420.4s	420.4	 and Safeway to include its devices in hundreds of stores.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=424.0s	424.0	 And then many investors saw these contracts as an endorsement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=426.8s	426.8	 of the technology and growth potential. But basically, those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=430.5s	430.5	 folks did no diligence and bought the hype. And so it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=432.6s	432.6	 just a whole cycle of this thing that basically fell apart because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=436.7s	436.7	 the tests didn't work. Freeberg. What are your thoughts as our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=440.8s	440.8	 life science guru?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=441.8s	441.8	 What's most interesting to me is how does this get to this point?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=445.8s	445.8	 If you're Elizabeth Holmes, you're 19 years old, and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=449.9s	449.9	 start telling your story. And the more grandiose the story you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=455.0s	455.0	 tell is the better the reaction you get is, it becomes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=458.2s	458.2	 reinforcing and the behavior extends a little bit further and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=461.4s	461.4	 a little bit further. Every time she told a story about how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=464.2s	464.2	 incredible this tech was, it's just one drop, you take one drop,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=467.8s	467.8	 it can measure everything. When she simplified it and reduced it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=471.4s	471.4	 to that, and it was such an incredible statement. And she saw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=474.0s	474.0	 the reaction from people, she's like, wow, that works. Let me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=476.4s	476.4	 repeat it. It's like any good salesperson, they figure out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=479.0s	479.0	 what sells and then they sell it and then they repeat. And what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=482.9s	482.9	 interesting to me that, you know, you talk about the media.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=486.4s	486.4	 But when she went out and pulled her story and got incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=491.2s	491.2	 press coverage, because she was a young female doing something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=495.5s	495.5	 that was going to save lives. There was this altruistic Steve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=499.0s	499.0	 Jobs esque kind of combination here, the media wrote a glowing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=503.8s	503.8	 review of her. And then she said, Wow, look, they said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=506.2s	506.2	 something great, let me go do that again. And she got a bigger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=508.1s	508.1	 media piece written a bigger media piece. And the more she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=510.9s	510.9	 said, the bigger she said it, the more she claimed she could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=513.2s	513.2	 do the bigger the story got, the more coverage she got. And the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=516.6s	516.6	 whole thing became this kind of reinforcing cycle. And I do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=520.0s	520.0	 think that the press coverage that she got, as she was building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=523.4s	523.4	 this business, which helped her raise capital helped her attract
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=526.0s	526.0	 employees helped her get Walgreens and Safeway to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=528.9s	528.9	 table, allows her downfall, it allowed her to build the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=532.8s	532.8	 business, but it's exactly what created the narrative that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=536.2s	536.2	 wasn't true. And so the coverage that the press gave her and we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=540.9s	540.9	 see this every day, you guys all see these top 50 companies, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=544.7s	544.7	 we all know, having met a lot of these companies, as you go down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=547.5s	547.5	 that list, this this 20 companies are total scam companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=551.0s	551.0	 they're fraud, they're not going to work, they're grifters, all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=553.3s	553.3	 the stuff that you guys might say about the quality of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=555.2s	555.2	 businesses. But the press reporter isn't doing diligence,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=558.3s	558.3	 they're not a no, you know, it turns out all the diligence was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=561.1s	561.1	 done after the fact. And then it's like, well, maybe we should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=564.3s	564.3	 go do some diligence. Oh, wait a second. Because the press
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=567.6s	567.6	 coverage has now created this hype story about who and what she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=570.4s	570.4	 is. The diligence actually pays off because you have something to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=574.8s	574.8	 take apart. If she was just a nobody startup that raised $30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=577.9s	577.9	 million, and they're still trying to figure out their way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=580.0s	580.0	 there would be no value in any reporter doing diligence on her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=582.6s	582.6	 and trying to figure out what was actually there. It was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=584.6s	584.6	 because the story got big, that it gave everyone including john
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=587.9s	587.9	 karyu, and incentive, he's the Wall Street Journal reporter who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=590.6s	590.6	 broke all this and incentive to go in and take this thing apart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=593.8s	593.8	 And so I really unfortunate and it's really self reinforcing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=597.9s	597.9	 the press coverage that created the circumstance here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=601.5s	601.5	 ultimately also enabled them the press to take the thing apart
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=605.0s	605.0	 and you know, land this woman in jail. And I'm not saying she did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=608.1s	608.1	 nothing wrong. But I'm just saying that there's a system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=610.6s	610.6	 here. And the system is set up in the press. Yeah, she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=615.3s	615.3	 questioned you free break. And then I got a question for saxon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=618.4s	618.4	 shimab her basic premise, that one drop of blood could get you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=622.4s	622.4	 hundreds of results. Let me just ask you a question free break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=624.9s	624.9	 At what point would one drop of blood, or so a nanotube be able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=630.1s	630.1	 to at our current technological, you know, ramp, be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=634.2s	634.2	 able to give us 100 different data points on a person, every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=637.7s	637.7	 time you're generating a data point, you're running what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=639.7s	639.7	 called an assay, which is a measurement of something. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=643.7s	643.7	 question is how much of a molecule are you measuring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=646.3s	646.3	 against what volume? Is there enough of that molecule in that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=650.2s	650.2	 volume to give you a statistically good reading? And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=653.0s	653.0	 that is a function of how precisely you can measure that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=656.6s	656.6	 thing. So there are there are great advances happening right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=659.7s	659.7	 now in a in a domain in life sciences of hardware technology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=663.2s	663.2	 called microfluidics. This is the manipulation of Pico leader,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=667.8s	667.8	 you know, very, very small volumes of liquid, and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=671.0s	671.0	 being able to run chemical assays using biochemical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=674.2s	674.2	 techniques, which we now have all these amazing new kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=677.2s	677.2	 tools like CRISPR and other things that would allow us to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=679.9s	679.9	 get a much more precise measurement with a much smaller
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=683.4s	683.4	 volume than has ever been possible. So we can manipulate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=685.6s	685.6	 small fluids, we can measure them. So there's nothing today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=688.5s	688.5	 that would physically say we cannot do many of the things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=692.0s	692.0	 that she claimed to have been able to do. But there are there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=695.0s	695.0	 a stacking of technology assets that need to be done to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=698.2s	698.2	 that happen in reality. Take a guess each of those assets are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=701.3s	701.3	 very different. So look, you could do it with cholesterol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=703.8s	703.8	 right now. You could do it with blood sugar right now. But you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=706.4s	706.4	 couldn't do both. You could theoretically you could put them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=709.5s	709.5	 into a device and do that. No, the reason the reason why lipids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=712.2s	712.2	 work, can you do 400 things with can you cannot I've actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=716.0s	716.0	 funded three of these businesses and I've poured almost 100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=718.4s	718.4	 million dollars of money into it and they've all failed. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=721.4s	721.4	 the reason is exactly what he said, you can do cholesterol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=724.2s	724.2	 because lipids are big enough, you know, and so you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=726.6s	726.6	 basically build an assay that can pick that off with a drop of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=729.6s	729.6	 blood, you can do a reasonably good job with pretty large
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=732.8s	732.8	 air bars on sugar. But all of this other stuff where you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=735.8s	735.8	 going to replace like a you know, a CBC or these broad, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=739.7s	739.7	 know, profile panels that we all get once a year to assess our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=742.7s	742.7	 health. Today, I don't think that that's necessarily within

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=748.2s	748.2	 because people aren't, you know, smart enough. It's just that not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=752.1s	752.1	 enough of this investment is happening because then you go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=754.6s	754.6	 back to this whole idea where the funding cycle needs to see a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=757.5s	757.5	 big payoff for the capitalists to want to get involved in this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=760.5s	760.5	 thing. And there really isn't, you know, it's not as if like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=764.1s	764.1	 quest and lab core are printing $400 billion of revenue and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=768.2s	768.2	 profits. And so that's not like there's a massive economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=771.5s	771.5	 incentive to run in. And so even when you know, we have tried on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=775.3s	775.3	 multiple occasions with completely different teams of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=778.6s	778.6	 incredible people, every single time we have failed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=782.3s	782.3	 So there's a physics law here that's just not physically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=785.5s	785.5	 possible. She made this claim, Saks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=788.7s	788.7	 And don't don't make it broad. There are things there are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=791.4s	791.4	 molecules, there are pathogens, there are things you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=794.2s	794.2	 absolutely detect small molecules, small molecules, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=797.4s	797.4	 can you can detect with a drop of blood, you know, measure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=800.4s	800.4	 counting how many blood cells you have in your whole body, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=804.5s	804.5	 know, using an estimate from a single droplet of blood, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=807.6s	807.6	 you know, we have these machines called flow cytometry machines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=810.2s	810.2	 where we sort blood cells. And then it'll tell you how many red
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=813.0s	813.0	 blood cells you have and how many different kinds of white
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=814.7s	814.7	 blood cells, that's a big part of your annual checkup that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=817.0s	817.0	 you'll typically get, you know, you need a good amount of blood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=819.5s	819.5	 to get an accurate reading on how many blood cells there are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=822.0s	822.0	 using even just using lasers and you know, these sophisticated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=825.3s	825.3	 machines, can you reduce that down to a droplet? Physically,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=828.6s	828.6	 probably not, right. And so there's some it's not universal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=831.3s	831.3	 to say this is possible, it's not possible, there are elements
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=833.5s	833.5	 that are absolutely possible, some of which are being done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=835.6s	835.6	 today. And there are some things that are going to be very hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=837.6s	837.6	 to pull off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=838.4s	838.4	 Got it. And she was making these claims as early as 2003 when it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=842.4s	842.4	 was founded. So we're talking about 19 years ago, and we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=844.7s	844.7	 saying here, it's not going to be possible to do hundreds of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=847.3s	847.3	 these things, maybe in our lifetime, we're talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=849.6s	849.6	 decades from now, we need to be some significant breakthrough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=852.2s	852.2	 Sachs, let me ask you a legal question. I was on a podcast and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=857.0s	857.0	 I said to them, why haven't the prosecutors had Bill Marris, who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=862.5s	862.5	 is a friend of freeberg's who helped me get him on the podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=864.9s	864.9	 He was great. Thank you for that. David, I'm this week in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=867.5s	867.5	 startups, very smart guy, very smart guy. And he came out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=871.2s	871.2	 publicly when he was running Google ventures. And he said we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=875.3s	875.3	 looked at it a couple of times he's referring to their nose,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=877.6s	877.6	 but there was so much hand waving, like look over here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=881.0s	881.0	 that we couldn't figure it out. So we just had someone from our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=884.6s	884.6	 life science investment team go into Walgreens and take the test
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=887.7s	887.7	 and it wasn't that difficult for anyone to determine that things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=890.3s	890.3	 may not have been not be what they seem here. Now, Sachs, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=895.6s	895.6	 was on this podcast to drop out, which I think is an ABC News
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=897.9s	897.9	 one. And I said, why didn't the prosecution bring up, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=901.4s	901.4	 GV, let's assume Sequoia and recent and you know, the 20 top
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=905.0s	905.0	 firms in the valley, who said no, and they all said no,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=908.0s	908.0	 because she wouldn't show them due diligence. And I asked them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=911.4s	911.4	 why didn't the prosecutors bring up those 20 firms and compel them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=915.6s	915.6	 to testify about why they didn't invest to give the counterexample?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=919.2s	919.2	 And she said, I don't know. Wouldn't that have been a much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=922.4s	922.4	 better strategy to say, here are the credible people who didn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=925.4s	925.4	 invest?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=926.2s	926.2	 I'm not sure I see the relevance of that, because Elizabeth Holmes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=929.9s	929.9	 crime was not promising something that she couldn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=933.5s	933.5	 ultimately deliver on. It's okay to fail in Silicon Valley. One of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=938.1s	938.1	 the best things about Silicon Valley is that we don't punish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=940.5s	940.5	 failure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=942.3s	942.3	 Her mistake wasn't making misrepresentations to the people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=945.4s	945.4	 who did invest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=946.7s	946.7	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=948.0s	948.0	 If anything, if anything, actually, what Elizabeth Holmes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=951.2s	951.2	 maybe should have done was call up some of those firms. And they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=954.3s	954.3	 could have said how easy it was for them to figure out that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=957.9s	957.9	 shouldn't have invested. Maybe that would have been a way to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=959.8s	959.8	 kind of muddy the waters on her side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=961.9s	961.9	 I was thinking that they would have said, hey, she wouldn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=964.9s	964.9	 show us the technology. And when we did our independent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=967.8s	967.8	 diligence, she wouldn't let us diligence we did outside back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=970.5s	970.5	 door diligence. It failed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=972.5s	972.5	 There were red flags all over this thing we had talked about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=976.0s	976.0	 in our poker games way before this thing went off the rails.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=979.6s	979.6	 The fact that there were no major VC firms involved who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=982.6s	982.6	 could who had expertise in biotech who could do the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=985.3s	985.3	 diligence, it was all sort of it was basically family office
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=990.7s	990.7	 money of people who weren't in Silicon Valley, you're writing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=993.4s	993.4	 big checks, whether it was Rupert Murdoch or the DeVos family or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=997.0s	997.0	 what have you. There were there were just red flags coming off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1000.8s	1000.8	 this thing, which is why Silicon Valley was not, by and large,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1004.2s	1004.2	 duped by it, the people who were duped by it were the people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1007.9s	1007.9	 that Elizabeth Holmes was able to sell the patina of Silicon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1011.5s	1011.5	 Valley to, and the media, because the media won't want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1017.0s	1017.0	 what we've seen over and over again is they don't fact check
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1019.3s	1019.3	 stories when they fit their priors. The prior here is that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1024.1s	1024.1	 you know, what the media want to believe is that the next Steve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1026.7s	1026.7	 Jobs is going to be a woman. And so when Elizabeth Holmes serve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1031.2s	1031.2	 that up to them wearing the black turtleneck, it was too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1033.9s	1033.9	 good a story for them to fact check too heavily. And so they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1036.7s	1036.7	 ran with it. It fit the same way in the same way that you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1040.9s	1040.9	 the ivermectin hoax that Rolling Stone ran with was too good a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1044.5s	1044.5	 story to be fact checked because they want to believe that the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1051.0s	1051.0	 there's there's 100 better examples of just I mean, just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1053.8s	1053.8	 to be generic sacks of other startups that we all know are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1056.7s	1056.7	 total nonsense. And total nonsense. There's a write up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1060.8s	1060.8	 about them. There's a there's a fraud in biotech going on right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1064.1s	1064.1	 now that David and I David and I saw upfront. I mean, it's like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1069.4s	1069.4	 this stuff is crazy. It's really, really great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1071.9s	1071.9	 Look, I mean, I think the moral of the story for entrepreneurs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1074.6s	1074.6	 I mean, I think there's a couple of takeaways here. Number one,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1077.1s	1077.1	 you got to be really clear with the present state of your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1079.3s	1079.3	 business, it's okay to talk about your grand vision of what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1083.4s	1083.4	 you're going to do in the future, but you cannot be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1085.6s	1085.6	 inaccurate in any way with respect to your current numbers

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1093.0s	1093.0	 number two, I think when you start working with the media in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1096.9s	1096.9	 this way to promote your company, you're playing with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1098.9s	1098.9	 fire, because the media really has two kinds of stories, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1102.0s	1102.0	 build up and they tear down. And when they're done building you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1105.0s	1105.0	 up, they're going to tear you down because that's the only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1106.8s	1106.8	 story left to right. So if you're gonna go court the media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1110.4s	1110.4	 in that way to try and get publicity, you better be really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1113.7s	1113.7	 careful how you do it, you better be really accurate. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1116.9s	1116.9	 you better not give them cause to later regret pumping you up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1120.6s	1120.6	 because they will tear you down even harder if you do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1123.5s	1123.5	 I think I think the more important danger that I just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1125.8s	1125.8	 like to speak generally to for a second is to not let other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1128.4s	1128.4	 people do your thinking for you. The investors that came into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1131.7s	1131.7	 this business came in under the assumption that this was a real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1134.9s	1134.9	 business, because the press had written about it. And the press
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1137.6s	1137.6	 wrote about it because the general had joined the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1140.2s	1140.2	 And the general joined the board because his buddy, George
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1143.2s	1143.2	 Schultz said, Hey, you should meet this lady. And the whole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1145.9s	1145.9	 thing ended up becoming this roundabout where no one actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1149.7s	1149.7	 did any original thinking and no one did any actual diligence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1153.1s	1153.1	 Stop and the whole thing ended up being this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1154.8s	1154.8	 Sorry. Now you're talking about actually how Silicon Valley
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1157.4s	1157.4	 works. So that's fucking bullshit. Yeah. Okay, you don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1159.7s	1159.7	 think these dopes run around thinking of Sequoia, benchmark,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1163.8s	1163.8	 social capital, craft invest, I'm just plowing the money in. Of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1166.8s	1166.8	 course they do. They don't even think social proof. They assume
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1169.9s	1169.9	 that we've done our diligence. You think they're doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1172.4s	1172.4	 principal diligence, like the Silicon Valley ecosystem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1175.6s	1175.6	 This is also how the Bernie Madoff scandal, you know, got so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1179.0s	1179.0	 far ahead of itself. No one actually went in and did the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1181.7s	1181.7	 audits of those financials. Everyone assumed that because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1184.6s	1184.6	 someone else is in this thing, and because someone else is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1187.5s	1187.5	 involved or someone else, something nice has been written
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1189.6s	1189.6	 about it or said about it, it's worth backing. And like the lack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1192.9s	1192.9	 of original thinking in business and life in general, I think is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1196.1s	1196.1	 you know, one of the biggest, you know, risks that each of us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1198.5s	1198.5	 takes. And it's why it's really important to learn how to think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1200.7s	1200.7	 of yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1201.6s	1201.6	 I have deep respect for early stage investors, because they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1205.9s	1205.9	 have to get in and make some critical decisions. Some people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1209.8s	1209.8	 make those decisions about the team, right, the psychology of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1213.6s	1213.6	 the co founders. Sometimes it's about the end market. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1216.7s	1216.7	 sometimes it's about a deep analysis of the traction. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1221.5s	1221.5	 you have to on it. Let's be honest, there is a valley of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1224.3s	1224.3	 funding between the series A and maybe the D or the E, where I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1230.4s	1230.4	 really think a lot of folks just look for signaling value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1233.7s	1233.7	 based on who the series investors were. So I'm not sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1237.2s	1237.2	 they're making but I'm not sure that those family offices were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1239.7s	1239.7	 any worse or any better. Like, maybe the Davos family looked at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1242.7s	1242.7	 Rupert Murdoch and said he's smart. So I'm in. Yeah, that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1245.6s	1245.6	 exactly what happened. That's so different than all these series
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1247.8s	1247.8	 B and C firms that say up benchmarks in on them. Totally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1251.2s	1251.2	 It's the exact same thing. Totally. I literally had a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1253.8s	1253.8	 situation and I think I brought it up in a previous episode
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1256.1s	1256.1	 where I was working on a deal. It wasn't like a major check for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1259.2s	1259.2	 us. It was you know, a six figure check. And they said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1262.6s	1262.6	 none of the other firms are asking for diligence. Why should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1265.4s	1265.4	 we give it to you? And I was like, how much are they putting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1268.2s	1268.2	 in? And they were putting in more money than I was. They were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1270.2s	1270.2	 putting seven figures in crazy. I said, when you ask for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1274.1s	1274.1	 diligence, now some of these founders look at you like, how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1276.4s	1276.4	 dare you? Exactly. They were no in this case, they were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1278.8s	1278.8	 insulted. And they said, we're not giving you diligence. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1281.8s	1281.8	 they and we walked away. It's like this company without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1284.4s	1284.4	 visiting the house. Yeah, they like buy it without this company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1288.0s	1288.0	 that David and I called called, you know, well, David was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1290.8s	1290.8	 calling it Theranos 2.0. But this company couldn't even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1294.1s	1294.1	 explain gross revenue. They couldn't they didn't. It was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1297.4s	1297.4	 like gross revenue, asterisks. And it's like, if there's one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1301.4s	1301.4	 metric on a P&L that can never have an asterisk ever the top
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1305.2s	1305.2	 line,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1311.0s	1311.0	 I get adjusted EBITDA, I get EBITDA, I get GAP, I get it. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1316.8s	1316.8	 But gross revenue asterisks. Open the register account the money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1323.5s	1323.5	 And so I just remember asking the simple question like, um, can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1327.9s	1327.9	 you just take the asterisks away and just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1330.8s	1330.8	 a company the two of you were looking at together?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1334.4s	1334.4	 You and I have talked about many times. Oh, really? You're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1337.1s	1337.1	 Theranos 2.0, sir. That's what this guy and I and I learned a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1341.2s	1341.2	 lot about Delaware law. I don't know if you guys have I've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1343.7s	1343.7	 talked about this company? Yeah, well, you in the text, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1347.1s	1347.1	 were like, I'm shorting this company. We'll tell you in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1348.4s	1348.4	 minute. We'll tell you. Right. Yeah, you know what it is. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1351.0s	1351.0	 anyway, I've been getting a big lesson here about Delaware law.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1355.0s	1355.0	 There's something called a section 220. Have any of you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1357.5s	1357.5	 ever had to file one of these?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1360.1s	1360.1	 It worked out really well. Sorry, go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1366.0s	1366.0	 Any of you aware of what a section 220 is or heard of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1368.9s	1368.9	 before? Basically, in a Delaware corporation, if you're a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1372.5s	1372.5	 shareholder of any size, not just like a board member with 10%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1375.4s	1375.4	 or whatever, if you feel there's malfeasance going on, you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1378.6s	1378.6	 file this 220 in Delaware. And according to this, a great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1382.8s	1382.8	 Scadden orps article on this, the Delaware courts are taking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1386.8s	1386.8	 very seriously that if there's any accusation of any kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1389.3s	1389.3	 malfeasance, especially financial, any shareholder, even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1393.5s	1393.5	 tiny can get all of the books. And in detail, not board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1397.4s	1397.4	 minutes, not top level PNL, like detailed financials. And so for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1402.4s	1402.4	 people who are running companies, and private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1405.6s	1405.6	 companies to this is in private companies look up section 220 of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1409.1s	1409.1	 the Delaware general corporate law.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1410.9s	1410.9	 I remember at Facebook is because we had these vagaries of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1413.5s	1413.5	 having to control shareholder count, or stuff like that. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1416.4s	1416.4	 information rights. Yes, we actually kept the financials on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1420.6s	1420.6	 a physical computer that was not connected to the internet. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1423.4s	1423.4	 the people that wanted it, had to come to our office. And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1426.9s	1426.9	 we remember them in like a windowless room without their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1429.0s	1429.0	 phone or something. Is that? I think that's, that's, that's how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1432.3s	1432.3	 they avoided people filing 220 requests. And so just something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1436.3s	1436.3	 for people to be aware of on both sides of the table, that if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1439.6s	1439.6	 there's shenanigans going on a company founders think, well, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1442.2s	1442.2	 don't have to give any information to my shareholders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1445.0s	1445.0	 And it's not true, whatever you have an information rights,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1447.4s	1447.4	 whatever your lawyers wrote is not above section 220 in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1452.6s	1452.6	 Delaware. So just keep that in mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1454.5s	1454.5	 I got a case like that right now going on. Where I don't give
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1458.3s	1458.3	 you information.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1458.9s	1458.9	 Well, it's not the founder, but there's a company that just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1463.8s	1463.8	 sold and they won't tell the shareholders like the terms of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1468.2s	1468.2	 the deal. What? Yeah. How's that? How's that even possible?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1472.8s	1472.8	 Good question. But it's it just reeks of fraud. I'm not going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1477.8s	1477.8	 say the name yet, because I'm hoping that they're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1479.8s	1479.8	 start acting in a more kosher way. But it's the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1483.1s	1483.1	 egregious thing I've ever seen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1484.8s	1484.8	 All you have to do is talk to your attorney at Wilson,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1487.6s	1487.6	 Fenwick, or whatever one of the cohort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1491.5s	1491.5	 the management of the company. They've engaged in a sale, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1494.6s	1494.6	 salesman publicly announced, we have reason to believe it's in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1497.6s	1497.6	 the hundreds of millions, and they won't tell anybody the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1499.7s	1499.7	 terms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1501.1s	1501.1	 Yeah, file a 220, file a 220. And you know what, they're public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1504.3s	1504.3	 So then the crazy thing about these two 20s is, it used to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1507.9s	1507.9	 that all of the information had to be private to sign like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1510.2s	1510.2	 non disclosures, whatever. And now, in certain circumstances,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1512.7s	1512.7	 I think it's in the best interest of all shareholders,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1514.6s	1514.6	 the 220 information can be public. And so that is just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1517.4s	1517.4	 like a sniper shot to anybody who is doing any kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1522.4s	1522.4	 shenanigans. We had a company in the same situation who wouldn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1525.8s	1525.8	 tell us about a sale. And then I have a call with the board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1529.3s	1529.3	 because I own 7% of the company. This is years ago. And I said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1531.9s	1531.9	 Can you explain to me what happened here? And they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1533.9s	1533.9	 like, Yeah, well, we're doing the sale and blah, blah, blah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1535.9s	1535.9	 And it turned out the bankers were taking 40% of the sale,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1538.5s	1538.5	 whatever. And I was like, Okay, well, I'm not going to approve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1540.6s	1540.6	 this. And you need my approval. Let's talk about how we can make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1544.5s	1544.5	 this work because we have outside funding that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1546.4s	1546.4	 company's turning down to do a sale that everybody's losing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1548.9s	1548.9	 their money on doesn't make any sense. And they said, Well, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1552.1s	1552.1	 can't really do that because we've already sent the eight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1554.0s	1554.0	 employees over to the new company that's buying it. I was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1556.7s	1556.7	 like, What do you mean? Like we ran out of money to pay them. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1560.3s	1560.3	 they all moved over to the payroll of the new company. I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1561.9s	1561.9	 like, you haven't closed the transaction yet. Well, it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1565.5s	1565.5	 crazy. Like there's some weird stuff that happens in private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1567.3s	1567.3	 companies. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1569.2s	1569.2	 This stuff is always at the peak of when there's a correction,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1572.3s	1572.3	 right? I mean, this may be a good segue to talk about what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1574.5s	1574.5	 going on. It's a great segue. But it's like that level of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1577.5s	1577.5	 grift happens right before. You know, basically, we have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1582.4s	1582.4	 rerate valuations, you know, because entrepreneurs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1585.7s	1585.7	 entrepreneurs just take so much. Well, there's just a small,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1588.9s	1588.9	 small percentage of them, but they just take so much leeway in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1591.5s	1591.5	 pushing the boundary. And,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1593.9s	1593.9	 and sometimes it's other board members who are acting their own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1595.8s	1595.8	 interest. But I saw this problem really easy. I called the CEO of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1599.6s	1599.6	 the public company that was buying them and explained the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1601.3s	1601.3	 situation. He's like, talk to my CFO, a fan of the pod,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1603.8s	1603.8	 whatever. And I they said, how do we solve this with you? I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1606.1s	1606.1	 said, Well, this is how much money I have in this the value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1608.2s	1608.2	 of your company. How would you like me to be an advisor to your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1610.6s	1610.6	 company for the same amount of that value in shares?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1613.3s	1613.3	 Also, you grifted. So no, that's great. So basically, you got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1617.4s	1617.4	 bamboozled. And so you bamboozled everybody else by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1620.0s	1620.0	 letting them use my language. And then they said, Okay, we'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1623.1s	1623.1	 make you an advisor. Then I took the advisor shares. And I wrote a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1625.9s	1625.9	 letter and pledge them to my investors. And my investors are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1630.5s	1630.5	 now three x original investment. And I said, I'm not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1633.5s	1633.5	 letting it go. I'm not signing the paper until I get the 250k
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1636.2s	1636.2	 that my investors put in period and then they did it now. I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1639.3s	1639.3	 up. But let's segue. Crazy market pullback. The great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1643.7s	1643.7	 write down has occurred charts from Al Timmer, our friend,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1647.1s	1647.1	 Brad Gerson, and I assume show a major regression to the mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1650.3s	1650.3	 for tech stocks, SAS index median enterprise value next 12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1653.3s	1653.3	 months, expected revenue, yada, yada. This includes people like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1656.5s	1656.5	 Adobe, Data Dog, Shopify Twilio Workday. And as you can see here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1660.9s	1660.9	 on the chart, which will pull up, sacks, explain to us what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1664.1s	1664.1	 happening here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1664.8s	1664.8	 Well, it's a major regression to the mean on value on public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1667.9s	1667.9	 company valuations in both SAS, but also more generally, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1672.1s	1672.1	 high growth stocks have corrected more than the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1675.2s	1675.2	 indices. So that would imply that there might be more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1679.1s	1679.1	 correction to come against the indexes. I think the growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1682.3s	1682.3	 stocks already taken the bulk of the hit. But what triggered at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1686.1s	1686.1	 this week is I predicted and you guys had similar predictions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1689.3s	1689.3	 on just a few weeks ago, that this would be the 2022 be the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1693.4s	1693.4	 year of the correction. And it really began in November, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1695.7s	1695.7	 had the Fed, you had Fed governors make some hawkish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1699.4s	1699.4	 statements about the about inflation, not being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1701.7s	1701.7	 transitory about the need to raise rates. Then we had the the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1705.8s	1705.8	 Fed Open Market Committee meeting, this is an I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1708.6s	1708.6	 around December 15. And they announced what they were going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1711.4s	1711.4	 to do on rates. And now this week, the minutes of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1714.9s	1714.9	 meeting were released. And it basically, it said something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1719.2s	1719.2	 that was completely different than what they announced to us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1722.0s	1722.0	 just three weeks ago. And so the market basically just seized up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1726.5s	1726.5	 and went into convulsions. And specifically, what they said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1730.3s	1730.3	 you know, in mid December was that they were going to taper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1734.7s	1734.7	 faster, they were going to end Q1, sorry, they're going to end
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1737.3s	1737.3	 QE at the end of Q1 instead of Q2. And then we're going to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1741.7s	1741.7	 quarter point rate hikes in Q2, Q3, Q4. That was the plan for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1746.0s	1746.0	 2022. And then there was additional guidance that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1748.7s	1748.7	 were expecting three more quarter point rate hikes in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1751.5s	1751.5	 2023, and two in 2024. So that was sort of the three year plan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1755.6s	1755.6	 that was laid out. Then we find out from these minutes, and I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1759.0s	1759.0	 guess these minutes weren't leaked or anything, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1761.1s	1761.1	 published them after like a three week revise and extend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1764.6s	1764.6	 remarks type period. But what we find out is that they were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1767.8s	1767.8	 what they were talking about was having a rate hike as soon as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1771.1s	1771.1	 Q1, and not just ending QE, but actually shedding assets, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1775.4s	1775.4	 is like the opposite of QE. So instead of basically going out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1779.0s	1779.0	 there and creating money shrinking the balance, yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1782.5s	1782.5	 shrinking their balance sheet. So instead of going out and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1784.5s	1784.5	 buying bonds, they're going to sell their bonds, which will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1787.3s	1787.3	 reduce the money supply. So look, if that was their view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1790.9s	1790.9	 three weeks ago, why didn't they announce it? I mean, my problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1793.7s	1793.7	 with this is it makes the Fed look like they don't know what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1797.5s	1797.5	 they're doing. Because they announced something just three,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1800.6s	1800.6	 three and a half weeks ago, that's completely at odds with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1802.8s	1802.8	 the statement they just put out. So either something changed in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1806.1s	1806.1	 the last three weeks, and there's been no data, or they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1808.4s	1808.4	 don't know what they're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1809.6s	1809.6	 Just so you know, they have a little bit of a track record of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1812.8s	1812.8	 this. So in 2018, it looked like there was going to be inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1817.5s	1817.5	 And Powell tried to get ahead of it. And he raised rates and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1822.7s	1822.7	 the market completely collapsed. And they were looking, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1825.5s	1825.5	 at Chinese data at the time. And it looked like, you know, China
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1828.6s	1828.6	 was turning, you know, going crazy, then China completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1831.4s	1831.4	 turned over. It was a complete head fake, the economy wasn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1834.4s	1834.4	 rip roaring, inflation didn't exist. And they basically just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1839.1s	1839.1	 curtailed a lot of investment and destroyed a bunch of value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1843.1s	1843.1	 So this time around, I think they're very sensitive to not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1846.0s	1846.0	 correcting too quickly. But then the opposite thing happened,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1848.7s	1848.7	 which is they probably waited a little too long. And now, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1851.9s	1851.9	 know, we're correcting too slowly too late, into the cycle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1855.7s	1855.7	 And we're just sort of digesting that reality. And so I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1860.8s	1860.8	 that, you know, we're probably to be honest with you, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1863.9s	1863.9	 actually, like, we puked it all out, for the most part, in my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1867.3s	1867.3	 opinion, you have to remember, right, like, the big difference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1870.2s	1870.2	 between now, and even 10. And frankly, more importantly, 2030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1874.4s	1874.4	 4050 years ago, is how many computers are involved that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1877.9s	1877.9	 trade, how much passive money is involved that owns assets, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1883.2s	1883.2	 how much of this stuff is sitting on the sidelines still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1886.4s	1886.4	 in money market accounts and munis. So if you look at those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1889.9s	1889.9	 markets, there is a ton, trillions of dollars waiting to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1895.5s	1895.5	 find a home. And what we've now done, and Brad's charts show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1899.6s	1899.6	 this is, we've basically chopped the head off of all of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1904.1s	1904.1	 fast growing growth, multiple, the underlying companies have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1907.2s	1907.2	 not changed once until it, right, these companies are still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1910.3s	1910.3	 growing by crazy amounts, like snowflake is still an incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1913.0s	1913.0	 business. Unbelievable, but the multiple that one was willing to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1915.8s	1915.8	 pay has been has been very much we rated, as is a bunch of other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1919.5s	1919.5	 companies. So let me ask you a question, Shama, if we've gone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1922.0s	1922.0	 from these 506070 multiples time sales, and now it goes back down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1926.2s	1926.2	 to 20. Is that, dare I say a buy signal? Well, those trillions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1931.2s	1931.2	 of dollars start moving back in because who wants to be in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1933.7s	1933.7	 money market? I don't I don't know. And I can't really call
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1935.9s	1935.9	 these things. But one really smart person that I talked to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1939.1s	1939.1	 this week, you know, he actually liquidated everything in October
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1944.6s	1944.6	 and November. And, you know, and I don't know, we talked about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1950.5s	1950.5	 this on the pod. But you know, I was feeling so much tension at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1954.4s	1954.4	 the end of last year, I actually, when I look back on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1956.9s	1956.9	 q4, it was probably the most difficult quarter of my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1960.6s	1960.6	 professional life. And just trying to manage risk, and I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1965.0s	1965.0	 exited a ton of positions, all my pipes, you know, my third
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1968.3s	1968.3	 party pipes, I basically sold off except for one, you know, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1972.1s	1972.1	 generated some liquidity in other places as well. And I was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1977.2s	1977.2	 glad that I did that, in part because I saw, you know, what he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1981.1s	1981.1	 was doing, and in part because, you know, Jeff and Elon were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1983.6s	1983.6	 selling. And I thought, I mean, this is just this is crazy to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1986.7s	1986.7	 sit on the sidelines and, you know, be the bag holder here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1990.8s	1990.8	 Going into q1, I talked to the same guys. And what he said to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1995.3s	1995.3	 me, which I think is very smart is, you have to really look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=1999.4s	1999.4	 the first and second derivative of the 10 year bond. Because when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2003.8s	2003.8	 that stops moving, like the 10 year bond is this beautiful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2006.7s	2006.7	 barometer of the collective wisdom of every single investor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2010.9s	2010.9	 in the world, about what they think about long term growth and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2013.8s	2013.8	 inflation. And it's a really important market, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2017.2s	2017.2	 we've talked many times, look at the 10 year break, even if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2019.8s	2019.8	 want to understand where inflation is going, we started to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2021.8s	2021.8	 talk about that seven months ago. And if you look at that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2025.1s	2025.1	 the rate of change, so the volatility in the 10 year yield
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2028.9s	2028.9	 is slowing way down. And if that continues to hold, that means
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2035.0s	2035.0	 that people are really saying there's a small amount of real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2038.0s	2038.0	 inflation, a reasonable amount of transitory inflation, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2042.1s	2042.1	 we're about to kind of wash most of it through the system with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2045.6s	2045.6	 you know, 100 basis points of rate hikes. And if that's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2048.5s	2048.5	 case, then you may see a quick pullback, you know, in q1, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2053.1s	2053.1	 we're back to the races again, because of all this other money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2056.2s	2056.2	 that's going to say, I got to get back in. And if you look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2058.1s	2058.1	 all these corrections, in the world of computer traded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2061.5s	2061.5	 algorithms, and ETFs and passive money, and it's all the snap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2066.3s	2066.3	 backs are so fast, you correct 20%, and then you whip it back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2070.4s	2070.4	 and you go. So I don't know. I mean, that's one view based on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2074.3s	2074.3	 the past. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2074.9s	2074.9	 when you have these big swings, remember, it's not that every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2079.6s	2079.6	 issue moves perfectly in sync with every other issue. So there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2086.0s	2086.0	 are these call it over adjustments that happen within a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2089.7s	2089.7	 cohort. So within a group of companies, some of them will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2092.9s	2092.9	 trade down much farther than others, the multiple will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2095.7s	2095.7	 compress much further than others. And there's certainly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2098.8s	2098.8	 opportunities within as there is in any market that's moving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2101.7s	2101.7	 quickly, to find businesses that now are prices mature, non growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2107.3s	2107.3	 value businesses, and they're profitable and growing. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2110.2s	2110.2	 there's a bunch of those out there now. And that wasn't the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2112.7s	2112.7	 case a month ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2113.6s	2113.6	 I don't think a single thing in the last quarter has changed in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2116.6s	2116.6	 the underlying fundamentals of the majority of businesses that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2120.1s	2120.1	 are public. And I actually think for the most part, nothing has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2124.0s	2124.0	 really materially changed for the majority of private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2126.9s	2126.9	 companies. All that's changed is what you're willing to pay in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2130.3s	2130.3	 the future for it. And the one thing that hasn't changed is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2133.9s	2133.9	 what you're willing to pay in the future for the private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2135.7s	2135.7	 businesses. So the real question, you know, for Sachs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2137.9s	2137.9	 and, you know, for the active investors in the private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2140.6s	2140.6	 markets, which I don't know what to think about is, will the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2145.6s	2145.6	 haircut that we've all taken in the public markets spill into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2150.0s	2150.0	 the privates and starting, it's starting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2152.5s	2152.5	 it feels to me, it's not just about what's going to happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2155.1s	2155.1	 with new emerging growth companies. But I mean, you guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2158.4s	2158.4	 correct me if I'm wrong, but there are hundreds of companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2162.2s	2162.2	 that have raised billions of dollars at valuations that if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2166.9s	2166.9	 they look in the public markets now, they are never actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2169.7s	2169.7	 going to achieve if they were to go public in the next three,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2172.5s	2172.5	 four or five years based on their projections.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2174.6s	2174.6	 So to your point, so what? Yeah, there are 900 unicorns right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2179.1s	2179.1	 now 900. And so once you get to look, it's one thing to be a $200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2183.7s	2183.7	 million company and sell to Microsoft or whatever. But when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2186.7s	2186.7	 you're a billion dollar company, there are very few
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2189.3s	2189.3	 buyers. I just want to point out there's a huge disincentive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2193.5s	2193.5	 for an investor or shareholder of VC or a private equity firm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2197.9s	2197.9	 to take a big write down on a company like that. And so there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2201.3s	2201.3	 there is always this push to what do we do next and it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2204.1s	2204.1	 creates this certain certainly I can tell you, I'd love your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2206.9s	2206.9	 point of view, but you're this really like unhealthy tension.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2210.3s	2210.3	 Because to take a write down on 900 unicorns is going to cause a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2215.9s	2215.9	 write down of hundreds of billions of dollars and not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2219.7s	2219.7	 getting across all VC portfolios in aggregate, because they're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2223.3s	2223.3	 going to end up going public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2224.5s	2224.5	 Well, I'm sorry, just to finish your thought, because the end
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2227.5s	2227.5	 market is only to go public. There are very few. There are no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2230.1s	2230.1	 M&A exits. Yeah, there are no and not in the billions of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2232.5s	2232.5	 dollars because you have to think one or two, one or two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2235.9s	2235.9	 sidelines. Okay. You know, even if you look at like Visa and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2239.0s	2239.0	 MasterPay, nobody's allowed to buy these companies. I have an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2243.2s	2243.2	 example that I can tell you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2244.9s	2244.9	 mid tier maybe but my point is when you have 900 companies with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2247.9s	2247.9	 a billion dollars in plus, they have to go public, they have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2250.7s	2250.7	 go public and correct. You can't go public into a valuation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2253.9s	2253.9	 framework that values you at 30 to 40% less of your last private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2257.8s	2257.8	 mark. Right? Yeah. It's a does it work? You did have to use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2261.2s	2261.2	 Chabot? So this is an important question. Because isn't that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2264.7s	2264.7	 going to be the case that all these VCs with the 2015 2016
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2269.9s	2269.9	 2017 2018 2019 vintage are going to end up having they've all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2274.1s	2274.1	 got these great marked books right now. You know, the books
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2276.5s	2276.5	 are all marked to 3x, you know, multiple on invested capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2280.8s	2280.8	 And now they're going to end up having these liquidity events
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2282.9s	2282.9	 that are going to come in a shockingly low valuations. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2285.9s	2285.9	 there's going to be this great read write down and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2287.8s	2287.8	 retrenchment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2289.1s	2289.1	 I can tell you there's a couple of examples. One is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2291.6s	2291.6	 athletic yesterday, which had raised money at 500 million just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2294.9s	2294.9	 two years ago, just sold for about 500 million to the New
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2297.5s	2297.5	 York Times. And those investors basically put money in and they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2302.1s	2302.1	 got their money back. It's a push. So I think you're gonna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2304.1s	2304.1	 say a lot of these push. No, I'm agreeing with you. Yes, I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2306.6s	2306.6	 going to give you the example. And there's also your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2308.2s	2308.2	 acquisition by a mid tier comp acquirer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2310.9s	2310.9	 And so there'll be plenty of those that occur. So there'll be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2313.1s	2313.1	 a lot of pushes, I think is my prediction of those 900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2315.7s	2315.7	 unicorns. And then for a lot of these SaaS companies, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2318.3s	2318.3	 saying you're you think that a bunch of them are going to sell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2320.1s	2320.1	 for under $1 billion. And the VCs because they have preference,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2323.7s	2323.7	 they're going to get their money. Correct. Correct. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2325.6s	2325.6	 it's going to be a lot of these pushes where I don't know what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2327.9s	2327.9	 is it in blackjack, David, when you're playing those three hands
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2329.9s	2329.9	 and you get a push like, and it's like, okay, I'm going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2331.7s	2331.7	 live to fight another hand, which we've seen sacks do a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2334.5s	2334.5	 number of times. And then for the SaaS is where sacks I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2337.5s	2337.5	 interested in your position, because we saw in SaaS, all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2340.6s	2340.6	 a sudden, the private market 3040 5060 70 times top line. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2345.3s	2345.3	 now it's gone back down to 2030 40. So those companies now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2349.3s	2349.3	 basically have three, the public markets have, but I don't think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2352.3s	2352.3	 the private market has happened already, everybody's pausing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2355.4s	2355.4	 And so for the people who raised that 50 x, congratulations, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2358.2s	2358.2	 did the right thing. If you have enough money to fill in that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2360.8s	2360.8	 valuation, congratulations, though, I mean, it seems like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2363.9s	2363.9	 they're pretty tough position now. You just raised money at a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2369.3s	2369.3	 billion dollar valuation with 10 million of revenue. You're like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2372.4s	2372.4	 Oh, 20. Let's say let's say 20. I mean, like, what are you going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2375.7s	2375.7	 to do? What are you going to do in your next round? Because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2377.1s	2377.1	 you're burning 100 million a year now or 40 million or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2379.6s	2379.6	 whatever it is you're burning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2380.9s	2380.9	 Almost all the companies I've seen in this exact situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2383.3s	2383.3	 that you're talking about have that 20 million, they got a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2385.2s	2385.2	 billion, they raised 100 million or 200 million. And they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2388.7s	2388.7	 basically now saying, Okay, we got to make this last until we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2391.6s	2391.6	 can catch up to that valuation and get to 50 to 75 million. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2395.1s	2395.1	 I think you I would take that deal as a founder and as an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2397.9s	2397.9	 investor, because it takes out the downside. And now you just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2400.9s	2400.9	 have to worry about catching up to the valuation and you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2403.1s	2403.1	 four years of runway. They're not going to know right size.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2406.3s	2406.3	 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2409.1s	2409.1	 those companies absolutely do not have four years of runway, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2412.1s	2412.1	 will bet dollars to donuts, they have two years or less. And most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2415.8s	2415.8	 of these companies have 18 months, which means they got to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2417.7s	2417.7	 be raising in six to nine. No, they're changing. They're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2420.8s	2420.8	 changing their spend and they're changing. They're not firing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2424.9s	2424.9	 anybody. You're not hearing about layoffs at startups. Okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2427.6s	2427.6	 all right. You're not hearing about it. But maybe they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2430.6s	2430.6	 changing their for looking growth plans. What are you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2436.3s	2436.3	 think that the trickle down effect is inevitable, but I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2441.1s	2441.1	 not sure it's fully kicked in yet. It's going to take a few
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2446.3s	2446.3	 high profile deals to land at say, 50 times ARR instead of 100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2451.7s	2451.7	 times ARR in order for everybody to know that there's a new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2456.1s	2456.1	 valuation level. So if you look at the Altimeter chart on set
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2460.7s	2460.7	 public SaaS multiples, let's see, I mean, they can pull it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2463.9s	2463.9	 up. It basically it's the SaaS index that shows median, median
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2467.4s	2467.4	 expected value to next 12 months revenue. And during this sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2474.1s	2474.1	 late 2020 early 21 period, it got as high as about 15 times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2480.3s	2480.3	 the historical average. Yeah, for well for next 12 months or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2484.8s	2484.8	 revenue. The which is sort of that kind of makes sense. So so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2491.3s	2491.3	 historically, it's around eight, right? So basically, all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2494.5s	2494.5	 valuation levels doubled. And now they've come down to about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2498.6s	2498.6	 10 times. So you could say that if it fully reverts to the mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2502.5s	2502.5	 we still got like another negative 20% to go. I don't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2506.5s	2506.5	 if that's going to happen. I mean, I think there has been a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2510.1s	2510.1	 greater recognition that SaaS businesses are some of the best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2513.2s	2513.2	 businesses to own, right? It's they are subscription software
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2517.3s	2517.3	 businesses, great gross margins, they just keep compounding. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2521.1s	2521.1	 maybe it will stabilize at 10 times. But I think what we can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2524.5s	2524.5	 say with 2020 hindsight is that the record price levels we got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2528.5s	2528.5	 to the public markets in 2021 were sort of unusual and unique
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2534.3s	2534.3	 and probably the result of this incredibly expansionary fiscal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2539.0s	2539.0	 monetary policy was coming out of Washington. Now has it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2542.7s	2542.7	 trickled down to the again VC markets yet? I mean, the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2546.0s	2546.0	 that that has to happen is that the latest stage investors, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2549.2s	2549.2	 crossover investors who invest in both public markets and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2552.4s	2552.4	 private markets, they have to pay, they have to start paying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2556.1s	2556.1	 less for the latest stage growth companies. And then you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2559.8s	2559.8	 all the downstream VCs are going to start paying less as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2562.8s	2562.8	 Because, you know, if you know, the markups are lower, you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2565.6s	2565.6	 to take that into account. So look, all of this is underway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2568.5s	2568.5	 right now. I mean, I gave a Bloomberg interview in December,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2573.1s	2573.1	 and I think I went on Maria Baromo show around that time as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2577.9s	2577.9	 well. And I kind of warned that all of this was coming. And yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2582.7s	2582.7	 we're in the midst of a giant rerating, because we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2585.8s	2585.8	 realizing that so much of the peak values we were seeing in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2591.6s	2591.6	 2020 and 21 were the result of artificial liquidity. And it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2596.5s	2596.5	 what you guys predicted, you know, it's one of our big, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2598.7s	2598.7	 know, I guess my big prediction for business losers this year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2603.5s	2603.5	 were asset classes that were highly dependent on liquidity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2606.3s	2606.3	 you guys predicted crypto would be one of those clearly, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2609.2s	2609.2	 taken a massive hit. Have you seen how much the crypto markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2612.8s	2612.8	 are off this in the last week? So it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2616.3s	2616.3	 so much for them being uncorrelated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2619.2s	2619.2	 No, it's highly correlated. Look, the crypto market's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2621.6s	2621.6	 coins going to be uncorrelated. So the markets are like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2624.6s	2624.6	 sponge for liquidity. And the more liquidity there is out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2627.3s	2627.3	 there, the more money can flow into a more speculative asset
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2630.6s	2630.6	 class. But look, my my my objection to this, I mean, is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2635.4s	2635.4	 that if you look at the feds actions, I mean, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2637.6s	2637.6	 Chamath is right that they waited way too long to react. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2641.8s	2641.8	 during the crisis, they overreacted. I mean, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2644.5s	2644.5	 pumped what we we on a previous pod, we showed the assets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2648.6s	2648.6	 oscillate between under reaction and overreaction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2650.8s	2650.8	 Yes, exactly. And now they're I think they're in now they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2654.0s	2654.0	 overreacting again. I actually think they nailed it in mid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2657.9s	2657.9	 December, they nailed it by giving us business certainty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2661.1s	2661.1	 around what the new rate environment was going to be. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2663.9s	2663.9	 just three weeks later, in the minutes to that very meeting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2666.9s	2666.9	 they completely undermine the certainty or the the greater
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2670.7s	2670.7	 level of certainty and predict, predictability that they had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2673.8s	2673.8	 provided markets, they've now introduced massive uncertainty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2677.5s	2677.5	 So it's just it's unbelievable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2680.1s	2680.1	 It's like their pilots and like, they stalled the plane and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2683.5s	2683.5	 they're like, Oh, let's pull back one more. They're kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2686.9s	2686.9	 pulling out the manual and learning in real time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2689.2s	2689.2	 Yeah. And it's like, you need to just point the nose down a bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2692.3s	2692.3	 and add a little bit of speed so you get some lift like it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2694.8s	2694.8	 really as tragic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2695.9s	2695.9	 that the performance of our government at every level over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2698.5s	2698.5	 since COVID at the last year since 2020. I mean, it's been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2702.9s	2702.9	 abysmal. I mean, first, you have the self inflicted wound of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2706.4s	2706.4	 lockdowns. I mean, the economy is going to take a hit no matter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2708.9s	2708.9	 what because highly at risk people would have stayed home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2712.1s	2712.1	 and reduce their economic activity. But instead of just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2714.9s	2714.9	 protecting the at risk people, we had to lock down the entire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2717.7s	2717.7	 economy. We padlocked Elon's factories, and on and on. So we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2721.6s	2721.6	 basically shut down the whole economy for no reason and states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2724.8s	2724.8	 like California kept it going way longer than they had to. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2727.8s	2727.8	 then the government just prints like five, six trillion and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2732.5s	2732.5	 Fed doubles the size of his balance sheet. And then now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2736.3s	2736.3	 they're abruptly getting off drugs. I mean, look, they put us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2739.0s	2739.0	 on drugs and now they're going cold turkey. And so I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2742.8s	2742.8	 there's actually like a much greater risk now of the economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2745.3s	2745.3	 going to recession this year, because of the feds overreaction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2748.3s	2748.3	 this week. I mean, they had they had the Goldilocks scenario
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2751.8s	2751.8	 down about three weeks ago, and I think they're going to tank
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2753.7s	2753.7	 the thing now, or there's a much greater risk of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2756.1s	2756.1	 Best advice for founders, private companies in this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2759.9s	2759.9	 turmoil, which are best advice, fam, you're a founder, you got,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2765.0s	2765.0	 I don't know, 18 months of runway right now, you're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2767.3s	2767.3	 into this, you know, slush, and you want to know what should I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2771.0s	2771.0	 do? What should I do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2773.1s	2773.1	 I think Paul Graham's advice makes the most sense here, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2775.6s	2775.6	 need to focus on being default alive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2779.2s	2779.2	 Define what that is just for people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2780.5s	2780.5	 Yeah. So you know, Paul Graham wrote this great essay, as part
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2783.5s	2783.5	 of what he's a founder of Y Combinator. And, you know, he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2786.1s	2786.1	 has this very simple, you know, framework of looking at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2788.9s	2788.9	 companies, which is your default debt or your default alive. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2791.6s	2791.6	 when you're losing money, as a company, and you're burning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2795.6s	2795.6	 enormous amounts of cash, your default debt. Now, if you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2798.2s	2798.2	 growing fast enough, default debt is a great strategy for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2801.7s	2801.7	 value creation. But at some point, everybody around you will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2806.6s	2806.6	 expect you to be default alive. And what that means is that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2810.1s	2810.1	 cost of what you do are less than the revenues you bring in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2813.9s	2813.9	 when the result or profits. And even then, that's not good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2817.5s	2817.5	 enough. I don't know if you guys saw, but you know, if you look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2819.7s	2819.7	 inside of big tech, I was shocked to find out that, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2823.3s	2823.3	 know, for example, you know, companies like Microsoft,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2825.8s	2825.8	 specifically, and Apple, you know, these guys traded huge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2829.5s	2829.5	 forward multiples, right for enormous profitability. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2833.3s	2833.3	 companies like Facebook and Google for the same level of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2835.7s	2835.7	 profitability, you know, trade almost a third less in terms of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2839.1s	2839.1	 multiple. So even when you're that good, it's not good enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2843.2s	2843.2	 to be default alive. That's how hard this game is over very long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2847.3s	2847.3	 periods of time. And so when you have a moment to really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2851.0s	2851.0	 understand how to be default alive, and you don't take it, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2855.6s	2855.6	 think it's a huge disservice because we don't do enough of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2859.2s	2859.2	 that kind of coaching that really inflicts that kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2862.7s	2862.7	 discipline and expectation setting. I remember I have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2866.4s	2866.4	 large climate investment, it's actually the single largest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2869.2s	2869.2	 investment I've ever done. And so I swept the details pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2873.5s	2873.5	 significantly. And you know, I was with the team in in November,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2879.6s	2879.6	 December, for board meeting and setting up 2022. And my whole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2884.1s	2884.1	 thing was, guys, you have to get default alive, you have to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2887.2s	2887.2	 contribution margins to be in a certain band, you were we are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2890.5s	2890.5	 going to target this level of free cash flow generation this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2892.9s	2892.9	 year. And there's no ifs, ands or buts about it. And what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2895.9s	2895.9	 great is the entire team embraced it and we're marching
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2898.4s	2898.4	 towards that. But if they didn't, and they're like, no,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2902.0s	2902.0	 we're just going to grow at all costs again. Oh, my god, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2905.2s	2905.2	 would be freaking out right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2906.7s	2906.7	 Freebird, what do you have to add to that as advice to founders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2909.1s	2909.1	 who have not been through this before?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2910.9s	2910.9	 I built my business, my climate corp. We raised around in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2915.4s	2915.4	 November of 2007, we raised 12 and a half million dollars, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2919.0s	2919.0	 then the financial crisis hit in 2008. And I'd say two things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2924.8s	2924.8	 were really important. Number one was just keep building. So if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2930.5s	2930.5	 you're building a great business, it doesn't matter what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2934.9s	2934.9	 the market perturbations are, you know, the market will value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2938.6s	2938.6	 you what they're going to value you add. And if you're a good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2940.4s	2940.4	 business, there's going to be money available to you. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2944.0s	2944.0	 second piece of advice is one that I know has been said over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2946.9s	2946.9	 and over again. But you know, never raise it a valuation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2950.5s	2950.5	 beyond, you know, what you're reasonably going to be able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2953.4s	2953.4	 kind of deliver returns on at some point in the future,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2955.5s	2955.5	 because otherwise those nasty dynamics emerge. You know, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2959.5s	2959.5	 could raise money at some crazy high valuation, that's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2962.0s	2962.0	 always the best thing to do, because then the expectation of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2964.5s	2964.5	 the investors coming in at that valuation, or they want to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2967.4s	2967.4	 three times that money or four times that money. And it pushes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2970.4s	2970.4	 you to do something unhealthy, like spend more than you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2972.8s	2972.8	 otherwise would stretch for a bigger outcome and put your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2976.4s	2976.4	 entire company at risk. So you know, two things to me have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2979.9s	2979.9	 always been just stay focused on building your business, don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2982.4s	2982.4	 let you know, kind of market conditions drive your decision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2986.0s	2986.0	 making and second,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2986.9s	2986.9	 define what for you is the best practice of staying focused on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2990.7s	2990.7	 your business, because that is a very general term. What is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2993.5s	2993.5	 freeburg, if you're going to say the top three things of focused
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2996.6s	2996.6	 on your business, tactically means
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=2998.5s	2998.5	 I have a simple rubric for value creation in a business, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3001.7s	3001.7	 know, number one is can you make a product? Number two is do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3004.6s	3004.6	 people want to buy your product? Number three is can you make a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3007.3s	3007.3	 positive gross margin selling that product to those people?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3010.5s	3010.5	 Number four is can you make a return on the marketing dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3014.2s	3014.2	 you have to spend to generate that gross profit? Meaning, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3017.0s	3017.0	 know, can LTV exceed CAC? And number five is can you scale the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3020.6s	3020.6	 amount of money you deploy to grow your business, such that as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3023.9s	3023.9	 you grow, the return goes up, not down. If those are the five
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3028.0s	3028.0	 kind of things you can accomplish in that order, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3030.6s	3030.6	 can build the next Google. And so and then the sixth thing is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3033.7s	3033.7	 can you be a platform which is me meaning can you transition to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3036.3s	3036.3	 being a multi product company that gets leverage out of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3039.1s	3039.1	 user base or the technology that you've built? Got it. And so you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3042.3s	3042.3	 know, if you can think about revenue streams, more multiple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3044.6s	3044.6	 revenue streams using the same customer base or multiple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3046.8s	3046.8	 products or you know, whatever. And so if you can achieve those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3050.2s	3050.2	 six things, in that order, every step of the way every increment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3055.0s	3055.0	 you can make across that spectrum drive significant value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3058.0s	3058.0	 as a business. Ultimately, what the multiple on your business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3062.0s	3062.0	 will be is purely going to be a function of what else is going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3065.1s	3065.1	 on in the world things that you cannot control. And so if you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3068.2s	3068.2	 driving your decisions about building your business using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3070.8s	3070.8	 that first rubric, good for you, you're going to succeed, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3073.5s	3073.5	 going to have money available to you. Awesome. If you're driving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3076.0s	3076.0	 your decisions based on what the market is telling you to do and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3078.9s	3078.9	 what the market is saying is available to you and money and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3080.9s	3080.9	 all that sort of stuff. You know, you're setting yourself up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3083.3s	3083.3	 to basically be, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3085.0s	3085.0	 are you also saying to be independent of valuation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3089.2s	3089.2	 Yeah, I'm always of the opinion that you shouldn't raise money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3092.1s	3092.1	 beyond your into evaluation, that you're not comfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3096.1s	3096.1	 saying in different market conditions or what have you, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3099.3s	3099.3	 can return multiple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3100.2s	3100.2	 I don't think any founder has ever, you know, most of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3103.6s	3103.6	 founders were not around in 2000. And they were too, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3108.0s	3108.0	 even 2008 was less important in my mind, because it was it was it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3111.8s	3111.8	 was fast. And again, we had government stimulus. So you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3114.9s	3114.9	 know, like, I think 2008 was an aberrational moment. I was I was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3118.5s	3118.5	 in the middle, you know, inside a Facebook one. And I was like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3121.2s	3121.2	 what the hell is going on here, the government's going to step
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3123.5s	3123.5	 in. And, you know, with tar printing a trillion dollars or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3127.4s	3127.4	 whatever it was, it didn't affect you guys. It didn't affect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3130.6s	3130.6	 us at all. Yeah, but you were the most powerful company or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3133.3s	3133.3	 started out at that time in 2008. Well, you're not in 2007.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3137.5s	3137.5	 lot of cash, right? No, no. Here's the thing that people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3142.3s	3142.3	 don't realize with Facebook, Google was profitable from day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3144.5s	3144.5	 one to Yep, we were always default alive. I want every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3148.2s	3148.2	 single person listening to this, to understand this. Okay, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3151.0s	3151.0	 sold poker ads for party poker in big banner ads on Facebook,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3155.9s	3155.9	 and we made money. You got the bag. You got yourself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3158.4s	3158.4	 independent were profitable. Okay, so I don't buy this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3161.9s	3161.9	 argument. That argument of unprofitable growth is a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3168.9s	3168.9	 larger funds to blind their pockets with fees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3173.0s	3173.0	 It's a function of what I mentioned before, which is if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3175.1s	3175.1	 you can think about the context of a portfolio of those bets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3178.9s	3178.9	 it makes sense. But if you think about your business, it doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3181.7s	3181.7	 make sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3182.4s	3182.4	 In 2000, that didn't make sense. You could not run an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3184.7s	3184.7	 unprofitable growth business, the money would not have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3187.0s	3187.0	 there. Right. And the real reason is that was a, a market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3190.3s	3190.3	 check, meaning you had people reallocating capital because risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3194.5s	3194.5	 rates were different, you know, you could put money at 6% in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3197.6s	3197.6	 in us 10 year bonds. Now, obviously, you can't do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3200.8s	3200.8	 today. So maybe this cycle is just the new normal. And so you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3204.5s	3204.5	 know, maybe you can always be default debt and be able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3207.3s	3207.3	 raise money because the incentives exist. But I wonder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3210.8s	3210.8	 when that stops. And so I don't know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3213.7s	3213.7	 Google was an incredibly cash efficient business. I think they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3216.3s	3216.3	 raised under 50 million as a private company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3218.7s	3218.7	 Never used any of it because Google the first the first thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3220.9s	3220.9	 Google did is they did a massive search syndication deal with AOL
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3223.7s	3223.7	 that paid them hundreds of millions of dollars. And that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3226.1s	3226.1	 funded the business if you can sell ahead of your customers in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3229.3s	3229.3	 terms of delivering the service or the product to them. You've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3231.9s	3231.9	 got the most beautiful business in the world. That's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3233.7s	3233.7	 definition of bootstrapping Google even though they raise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3235.9s	3235.9	 venture capital, effectively bootstrap the business by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3238.8s	3238.8	 getting customers to prepay like getting people to prepay for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3241.8s	3241.8	 cars. I wrote this in my annual letter like two years ago, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3244.9s	3244.9	 Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon raised
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3247.5s	3247.5	 collectively less than $250 million. Yeah, I mean, what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3250.7s	3250.7	 Yeah, so I mean, I agree with a lot of what you guys have said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3256.1s	3256.1	 I mean, so I agree with Freeberg that recessions or downturns are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3259.4s	3259.4	 actually great times to build startups because innovation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3262.0s	3262.0	 doesn't stop and you know, so PayPal was predominantly built
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3264.5s	3264.5	 after the dot com crash. Yammer was probably built after the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3268.3s	3268.3	 2008 sort of great recession. So it's absolutely doable. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3271.9s	3271.9	 some things actually get easier in a downturn. There's like way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3274.6s	3274.6	 fewer startups getting funded. And so like talent gets easier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3277.7s	3277.7	 to recruit. So, you know, things loosen up in, you know, in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3281.8s	3281.8	 terms of the company building side. The only thing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3284.2s	3284.2	 really gets harder in a downturn is fundraising, right? This is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3287.7s	3287.7	 and by the way, I think it's a good practice for founders not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3291.3s	3291.3	 to care what happens in the public markets, the NASDA early
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3294.4s	3294.4	 state founders, right? Because the only time that really touches
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3298.0s	3298.0	 you is when you need to access the capital markets, right? And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3301.1s	3301.1	 then you will be subject to the downstream impact on VCs of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3304.8s	3304.8	 what's happening in the market. So the only thing that really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3307.9s	3307.9	 gets harder is fundraising. And this is where I think Chamas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3311.9s	3311.9	 advice comes in. I personally think that trying to achieve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3315.5s	3315.5	 default alive status is too high a bar. I mean, it's a wonderful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3319.6s	3319.6	 thing if you can do it. I mean, Facebook did it, Google did it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3322.6s	3322.6	 the very best companies did it. But I know very few SaaS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3325.7s	3325.7	 companies that could continue to grow if they had to be cash flow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3328.7s	3328.7	 positive, I mean, at an early stage. So the metric I use is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3332.9s	3332.9	 burn multiple, I wrote a blog about this once. It's basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3336.6s	3336.6	 just how much are you burning for every dollar of net new ARR
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3340.5s	3340.5	 you're adding. So in other words, like, if you're burning a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3344.4s	3344.4	 million dollars, you know, over whatever period of time, a month
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3347.7s	3347.7	 quarter year to add a million dollars of net UAR, that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3351.1s	3351.1	 actually pretty good. So a one to one of like one or less is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3354.8s	3354.8	 amazing, I'd say even up to two is good. So in other words, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3359.3s	3359.3	 if a SaaS company can say add 10 million of net new ARR in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3363.3s	3363.3	 year and burn 20, I think VCs will fund that all day long,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3366.9s	3366.9	 even in a recession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3368.6s	3368.6	 Two year payback.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3369.3s	3369.3	 Yes. But when you start getting to burn multiples of three,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3371.9s	3371.9	 four, five, six and up, that's when like VCs are going to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3375.5s	3375.5	 wait a second. Yeah, you're that growth is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3377.7s	3377.7	 efficient, right? You're not efficient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3379.1s	3379.1	 Not just efficient, but it starts to raise questions about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3381.2s	3381.2	 your product market fit, because you're effectively spending too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3384.1s	3384.1	 much money to grow. So like, why is the growth that hard, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3388.3s	3388.3	 No market pull. Yeah, no more. Yeah, exactly. No market pull.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3390.8s	3390.8	 I think it's a good way of putting it. So I do think you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3392.4s	3392.4	 have to start like in a downturn or in choppy waters, you have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3395.2s	3395.2	 sharpen the pencil, get more efficient about your burn, look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3398.1s	3398.1	 at your burn multiple. And then I think, you know, if you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3401.1s	3401.1	 the opportunity to top off your war chest, like that's smart,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3403.8s	3403.8	 you know, and don't wait too long,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3405.3s	3405.3	 and be frugal. I mean, God, the amount of like, crazy spending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3410.1s	3410.1	 I'm seeing in some startups and unnecessary spending, if you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3412.8s	3412.8	 spending something, it's not going into product, it's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3415.3s	3415.3	 going into marketing, you know, it's not going into sales. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3418.5s	3418.5	 it's not, you know, just you really have to ask yourself, why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3420.8s	3420.8	 am I spending money on going to this conference going to that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3423.1s	3423.1	 conference on this office space? Like really be frugal. I know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3426.6s	3426.6	 that it's we have all this money sloshing around, you're looking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3428.7s	3428.7	 for things to spend it on. But stay focused. Yeah, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3433.5s	3433.5	 yeah, don't spend 7500 on that unless you've got tons of cash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3437.0s	3437.0	 laying around. And we will be getting back to the people who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3440.4s	3440.4	 applied we're going to go through and somebody's gonna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3443.6s	3443.6	 approve you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3444.9s	3444.9	 Let's add one other thing to this, which is you're right that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3447.5s	3447.5	 like most founders have never even seen a downturn because the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3450.0s	3450.0	 last big one was a great recession of 2008 2009. So many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3453.3s	3453.3	 founders were even around back then.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3454.6s	3454.6	 The most the most real the real one was 2000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3457.0s	3457.0	 That's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3458.9s	3458.9	 It froze, I would say it froze to that 2008 was what like 12 to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3463.5s	3463.5	 18 months of choppiness. And I would say a lot of companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3466.7s	3466.7	 couldn't raise money had to do down rounds had to do multiple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3469.2s	3469.2	 liquidation preferences. It was gnarly on some cap tables during
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3472.1s	3472.1	 that period. And if you don't know what multiple liquidation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3475.0s	3475.0	 preferences are, as your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3476.8s	3476.8	 I understand, but there was no real market check. The market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3479.3s	3479.3	 check was really in 2000. And you saw it was a multi year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3483.1s	3483.1	 slog. It was a bloodbath. You had to be devolved. vaporized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3486.9s	3486.9	 Yes, people you had to be default alive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3489.1s	3489.1	 Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. But I would say a third of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3492.2s	3492.2	 startups went away in 2008.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3493.6s	3493.6	 I don't think we're running into that again. So you know, let's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3496.1s	3496.1	 not create a Sequoia graveyard.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3504.5s	3504.5	 funded, right. And that's kind of lower. It's it's not like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3508.4s	3508.4	 but here's the thing, what I what I what's shocking to me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3510.5s	3510.5	 it's like, I don't understand why people think you can grow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3514.1s	3514.1	 infinitely forever. It's just not true. Even the best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3518.1s	3518.1	 businesses in the world after 15 or 20 years are barely growing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3521.9s	3521.9	 at 20%. People forecast Facebook and Google. Those are the two

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3528.7s	3528.7	 But it isn't the question of what kind of growth VCs are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3530.7s	3530.7	 willing to finance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3532.1s	3532.1	 No, what I'm saying is, if you know that your terminal growth

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3547.3s	3547.3	 some point, if you don't figure out how to make money by selling

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3559.3s	3559.3	 not that fundable. And this is what's shocking to me. It's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3561.8s	3561.8	 that data is hiding in plain sight for anybody to look at. It
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3565.1s	3565.1	 doesn't make sense unless you believe that those those growth

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3586.3s	3586.3	 That's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3587.7s	3587.7	 Just wing it. Yeah, it'll work out. Don't worry about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3592.5s	3592.5	 Just add like crazy ground. It's fine. Those features will work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3595.9s	3595.9	 and save the day. There's some magical. Did you see Andreessen

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3602.7s	3602.7	 across incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3603.9s	3603.9	 Congratulations. They're building a colossus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3607.6s	3607.6	 Yeah, I mean, there's gonna Silicon Valley in terms of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3610.7s	3610.7	 capital is, you know, seeing kind of power returns itself,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3615.2s	3615.2	 right? There's going to be a few firms that are going to, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3617.5s	3617.5	 know, control 80% of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3619.5s	3619.5	 should go public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3620.7s	3620.7	 Andreessen, Tiger, Tiger Global, you know, whatever happens, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3625.0s	3625.0	 don't know if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3625.2s	3625.2	 South Korea should go public. I mean, there's a few that's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3627.8s	3627.8	 market. I'm just saying, like, if you look at the aggregate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3630.5s	3630.5	 capital that's being deployed into private markets right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3633.3s	3633.3	 in probably two years, 80% of it's going to come from three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3636.6s	3636.6	 firms or four firms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3637.7s	3637.7	 The problem is, if you're running that much money, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3640.7s	3640.7	 insane to not take your GP public because it's the only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3643.6s	3643.6	 way like you're not really generating carry at that point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3646.8s	3646.8	 because you're generating a market beta return. So you'll do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3649.9s	3649.9	 okay. But when you're sitting on 2030 40 billion of imputed wealth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3654.6s	3654.6	 by being the owner of the GP of Tiger or Andreessen, you'd be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3658.3s	3658.3	 insane to not go public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3659.5s	3659.5	 I think the odds are going to be pretty high that Andreessen will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3662.4s	3662.4	 go public, right? I mean, they're certainly setting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3664.1s	3664.1	 themselves up to be a lot more than just a capital allocator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3666.5s	3666.5	 Though, right? It's never happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3668.0s	3668.0	 Well, TPG just fall to the public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3669.9s	3669.9	 Yeah, KKR.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3671.7s	3671.7	 Public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3672.3s	3672.3	 Apollos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3672.9s	3672.9	 Okay, I'm talking about venture though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3674.7s	3674.7	 I'm talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3674.9s	3674.9	 No, but I mean, like venture has never scaled up to the point that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3677.5s	3677.5	 private equity has until now. And now that they have, it's very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3680.3s	3680.3	 likely, it's very likely that you'll see Andreessen be the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3682.8s	3682.8	 first, I don't know them, you know, very well, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3685.5s	3685.5	 Saks, you were gonna say something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3686.4s	3686.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3686.9s	3686.9	 Well, I think it's a super interesting point. Because if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3688.6s	3688.6	 talk to the previous generation of VCs, what they will tell you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3691.9s	3691.9	 is who retired, right is when you ask them, well, did you get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3695.5s	3695.5	 anything for your partnership share in the firm, not just in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3699.0s	3699.0	 fund, but in the firm, they'll tell you no, they basically just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3701.9s	3701.9	 gave it away to the next generation of partners, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3704.1s	3704.1	 they built the firm. And it's because of what the historically,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3707.4s	3707.4	 the belief on the part of VCs was that there was no value to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3710.9s	3710.9	 VC firms, other than just their interest in each particular fund.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3716.1s	3716.1	 But you're right, like if they do achieve a much greater level
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3718.6s	3718.6	 of scale, and they can go public, then there is actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3722.7s	3722.7	 value in the firm itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3724.8s	3724.8	 And if you look at the term of valuation of Blackstone as indexed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3727.9s	3727.9	 to AUM, you know, once you pass a couple hundred billion of AUM,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3732.1s	3732.1	 you can trade point two towards point one point two times. And so,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3736.5s	3736.5	 you know, if you have 50 billion of AUM, there's $10 billion market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3740.1s	3740.1	 cap there. And if you you know, if you're calling point or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3743.1s	3743.1	 Andreessen or Horowitz, I mean, that's $5 billion that just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3747.6s	3747.6	 appeared out of nowhere, why would you not do it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3749.7s	3749.7	 Right. It's a little bit like Goldman Sachs, they always said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3752.2s	3752.2	 that we're a partnership, we're never gonna IPO because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3755.0s	3755.0	 and then they did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3755.7s	3755.7	 And then they did. And the same thing with did CA do it too? No, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3759.9s	3759.9	 guess they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3760.2s	3760.2	 now what happened with today was OVETS sold his position to go to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3763.9s	3763.9	 Disney, so there would be a conflict, but he could have kept
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3766.2s	3766.2	 it and the like residuals they were getting from projects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3769.5s	3769.5	 that were incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3771.1s	3771.1	 Didn't the R.E. Emanuel one?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3773.2s	3773.2	 It did Endeavor did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3774.2s	3774.2	 Endeavor. How are they trading? I haven't even looked at Endeavor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3778.1s	3778.1	 I'm not sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3778.8s	3778.8	 Let me tell you, like, it's actually, but think about if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3781.5s	3781.5	 you're not like the current, like partner owners of the firm, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3785.3s	3785.3	 you're like on a partnership track there, and you're working
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3787.4s	3787.4	 your way up to partner, like by time you get to partner, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3790.7s	3790.7	 gonna be a very different economic equation, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL8uXZDz_o0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=73&t=3793.0s	3793.0	 instead of getting your one over n share of the pie, when you
