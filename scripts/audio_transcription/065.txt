https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1.3s	1.3	 I think that guy Palmer Lucky is super fascinating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3.4s	3.4	 The Oculus guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4.2s	4.2	 Why do you want to talk about that company?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=5.7s	5.7	 Cause I think an American company-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=7.6s	7.6	 He's launching a syndicate soon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=8.4s	8.4	 No, I-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=9.2s	9.2	 Are you an investor?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=10.1s	10.1	 Parma Lucky hates me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=11.2s	11.2	 He won't come on this week in startups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=12.4s	12.4	 He literally hates me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=13.3s	13.3	 What did you call him? Parma Lucky?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=15.0s	15.0	 Palmer Lucky, cosplay Palmer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=17.9s	17.9	 He's a cosplayer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=19.0s	19.0	 I like the fact that he does cosplay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=20.2s	20.2	 What is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=21.3s	21.3	 That's when you dress up as comic book
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=22.7s	22.7	 or like superhero characters and go to conventions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=24.6s	24.6	 You know how you dress up in the clothes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=26.2s	26.2	 of old Italian women?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=27.5s	27.5	 He dresses up like a superhero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=30.8s	30.8	 These are cold open folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=35.0s	35.0	 I do dress like a Matrona sometimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=37.0s	37.0	 Yeah, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=37.8s	37.8	 I'm a matrona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=39.5s	39.5	 I'm making you a matrona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=41.6s	41.6	 You want a matrona with the vodka.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=43.3s	43.3	 So I'm making it for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=44.8s	44.8	 In Italy, there's like a culture like in the olden days,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=49.4s	49.4	 like it's like, you used to have these things called salotti,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=51.3s	51.3	 which basically meant like all the decisions of the country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=54.3s	54.3	 were made by these people in the living rooms after dinner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=57.2s	57.2	 And the most powerful people in the salotti
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=60.2s	60.2	 were these women who were married to these men
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=63.3s	63.3	 and they would be the architects of all these decisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=65.1s	65.1	 Oh, the Mussolini, I don't like him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=66.9s	66.9	 He never finished the pasta.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=68.5s	68.5	 He always leaves so much on the plate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=70.1s	70.1	 And people would call them matronas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=72.8s	72.8	 So I'd proudly be a matrona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=74.7s	74.7	 I've always felt you were like the old Italian lady
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=77.6s	77.6	 in our group.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=87.3s	87.3	 We open source it to the fans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=89.0s	89.0	 and they've just gone crazy with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=90.6s	90.6	 Love you, SIS.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=91.4s	91.4	 Queen of Kid Wop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=92.9s	92.9	 I'm going all in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=95.1s	95.1	 Hey everybody, welcome to another episode
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=97.2s	97.2	 of the All In Podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=98.8s	98.8	 Yes, we're still publishing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=100.5s	100.5	 Yes, we haven't been canceled,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=102.6s	102.6	 but it's early in the show, so you never know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=105.4s	105.4	 With me again, the dictator himself,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=107.2s	107.2	 Chamath Paliha Bhatia, the Sultan of Science,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=111.4s	111.4	 David Friedberg, whatever beverage you like,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=116.0s	116.0	 And of course, yeah, the Rain Man himself,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=119.5s	119.5	 yeah, definitely gonna win the midterms,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=121.4s	121.4	 yeah, David Sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=124.0s	124.0	 Everybody have a great week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=125.2s	125.2	 getting their asses kicked in the market?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=128.0s	128.0	 I'm pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=129.3s	129.3	 You're okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=130.2s	130.2	 Everybody okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=131.0s	131.0	 Nobody jumping out of the window?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=133.1s	133.1	 I can't look at my portfolio anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=134.8s	134.8	 I just stopped checking it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=136.2s	136.2	 I...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=138.0s	138.0	 Not a fan of the color red.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=140.2s	140.2	 I actually, I've been using this period
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=143.4s	143.4	 to kind of desensitize myself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=145.4s	145.4	 I went back and I started to think about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=147.4s	147.4	 all of the sort of errors of commission
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=152.7s	152.7	 that I've done in the last decade,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=155.0s	155.0	 and I was able to look at four or five
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=159.1s	159.1	 specific trading moments where I was like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=160.6s	160.6	 wow, what did I do that for?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=163.4s	163.4	 And I came away with two things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=165.2s	165.2	 One was if I confuse an investment with a trade,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=170.1s	170.1	 I'm done for, meaning there are things that you invest in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=172.6s	172.6	 that you just wanna own forever,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=173.7s	173.7	 and then there are things that are trades
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=175.3s	175.3	 that are just speculative, and at the end of the day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=177.8s	177.8	 you have a sense that it could be up in the short term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=181.0s	181.0	 If I confuse those two, I've made huge mistakes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=183.7s	183.7	 And then the other one is I would always get really emotional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=186.1s	186.1	 and panic at the lows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=187.9s	187.9	 And so I was like, in early December or November,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=191.5s	191.5	 when I wrote that letter on Twitter and we talked about it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=193.7s	193.7	 and I sold a bunch of stuff after Jeff and Elon were selling,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=197.9s	197.9	 raised some cash, and I was like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=199.2s	199.2	 okay, now I have enough buffer here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=203.6s	203.6	 The whole point from here on out is to basically insulate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=207.4s	207.4	 myself from my own emotional turmoil as stocks go down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=211.6s	211.6	 And so far so good, and my litmus test,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=213.7s	213.7	 if when I go home at the end of every day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=217.1s	217.1	 I check in with Nat and I'm like, am I an asshole?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=219.7s	219.7	 Because if I, when I can-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=221.1s	221.1	 She's like, yes, what does that have to do with investing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=222.6s	222.6	 When I get crushed in the market,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=224.1s	224.1	 I tend to take it out on my friends and my loved ones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=227.0s	227.0	 Honestly, because I'm just-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=227.8s	227.8	 We're your friends, we know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=229.0s	229.0	 We come to your poker game when your socks are down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=232.3s	232.3	 and you're just like, that's it, run it once.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=234.6s	234.6	 That's it, I'm popping the blinds up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=236.4s	236.4	 I can't take it anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=237.6s	237.6	 Do you remember last year, Timop,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=238.8s	238.8	 during the market collapse at the start of COVID,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=243.0s	243.0	 and you decided you didn't care
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=244.7s	244.7	 about having nice jeans anymore?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=246.4s	246.4	 And then you fast forward to December
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=248.4s	248.4	 and you were proclaiming the virtue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=250.6s	250.6	 of a $5,000 fresh alpaca sweater or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=254.9s	254.9	 I think another indicator of sentiment in the market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=257.6s	257.6	 for you is your clothing choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=261.6s	261.6	 This is a really nice cashmere ribbed sweater
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=265.2s	265.2	 from Loro Piana.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=266.5s	266.5	 Okay, well, we're back in the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=268.0s	268.0	 It's good to see we're back to normal now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=269.6s	269.6	 Yeah, let me ask you then,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=270.6s	270.6	 I'm gonna put a couple of items out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=272.9s	272.9	 Is Bitcoin a trade for you or an investment for you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=276.9s	276.9	 Or was it, and is it now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=278.4s	278.4	 Well, I invested it in 2011 at $80.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=281.8s	281.8	 Yeah, yum yum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=283.4s	283.4	 I wrote an op-ed in that same year in Bloomberg,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=287.5s	287.5	 which I hope at some point they take off the paywall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=290.0s	290.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=291.1s	291.1	 And the whole thing was you should have 1%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=293.1s	293.1	 of your net worth in this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=294.4s	294.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=295.6s	295.6	 It's remained an investment ever since.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=297.5s	297.5	 So still an investment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=298.7s	298.7	 Yeah, I've structured it so that I don't hold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=300.4s	300.4	 any Bitcoin personally myself,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=302.0s	302.0	 because I don't want to have the pressure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=303.7s	303.7	 and the risk of keys and coins and wallets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=306.2s	306.2	 and this and that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=308.2s	308.2	 But I still really believe in Bitcoin in the long-term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=311.1s	311.1	 Got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=312.0s	312.0	 Sax, how do you deal with the emotional turmoil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=315.4s	315.4	 of opening up your stocks, crypto, whatever wallet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=318.6s	318.6	 and seeing red and then going to work every day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=321.4s	321.4	 or you just curled up in a ball playing chess
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=323.2s	323.2	 with Peter Tille at this point?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=325.5s	325.5	 Yeah, I mean, you just gotta try and ignore it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=327.4s	327.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=328.4s	328.4	 Try was a key word in that sentence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=330.2s	330.2	 It doesn't really affect me that much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=331.5s	331.5	 I mean, so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=332.3s	332.3	 I run the avoidance acceptance function.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=334.5s	334.5	 I have removed my emotions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=337.2s	337.2	 No, look, there are countervailing benefits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=339.5s	339.5	 So when exit prices are great, entry prices are lousy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=345.0s	345.0	 And when entry prices are great,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=348.0s	348.0	 exit prices are lousy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=349.3s	349.3	 So there's an inverse relationship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=350.6s	350.6	 So in other words, all the companies that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=353.4s	353.4	 I mean, the public markets have massively corrected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=356.4s	356.4	 And now finally, we talked about this a few months ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=360.5s	360.5	 those new price levels have trickled their way down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=363.2s	363.2	 into venture markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=364.2s	364.2	 And so finally, venture deals are starting to price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=367.2s	367.2	 at more reasonable prices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=369.0s	369.0	 So in terms of harvesting gains from old investments,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=375.5s	375.5	 obviously it's not as attractive as it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=378.7s	378.7	 three months ago, but in terms of making new investments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=381.2s	381.2	 is much more attractive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=382.7s	382.7	 And for a relatively young venture firm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=386.1s	386.1	 which is what we are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=387.6s	387.6	 yes, we do have some investments that are kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=389.7s	389.7	 in the harvesting stage, but we're only a four
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=392.5s	392.5	 or five-year-old firm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=394.0s	394.0	 We're still, the bulk of our activity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=395.8s	395.8	 is making new investments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=396.6s	396.6	 So, it's all just kind of part of the game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=401.6s	401.6	 and I'm not really that worried about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=403.0s	403.0	 Said another way, fortunes are made in the down market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=405.9s	405.9	 They're collected in the up market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=408.7s	408.7	 I always phrase it, but it's true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=409.6s	409.6	 Things are gonna be on sale right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=411.2s	411.2	 We saw Bill Ackman, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=414.1s	414.1	 who I think is a friend of the pod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=416.2s	416.2	 I think he listens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=417.2s	417.2	 Yeah, super, super, super smart, brilliant guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=419.8s	419.8	 Yeah, and I just wanna emphasize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=421.2s	421.2	 cause I don't want founders to get the wrong idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=423.2s	423.2	 It's not like we're trying to pull one over on founders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=427.1s	427.1	 and get some sort of sweetheart deal or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=429.7s	429.7	 My view of like our role as VCs is just to be a price taker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=435.0s	435.0	 of whatever prices the market sets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=436.8s	436.8	 We don't try and negotiate something better than market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=439.4s	439.4	 Really, we just take the market price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=442.2s	442.2	 and we pick the companies we wanna be in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=444.3s	444.3	 So, that's our job is really just to pick,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=446.2s	446.2	 not really to negotiate that much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=448.4s	448.4	 You're not able to haggle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=449.4s	449.4	 It's not like you can go to like the supermarket
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=452.0s	452.0	 and be like, oh, bananas are a dollar a pound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=453.6s	453.6	 I'll take them for 50 cents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=454.6s	454.6	 They're like, oh, sir, this is a Whole Foods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=456.5s	456.5	 We don't negotiate prices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=457.7s	457.7	 So, we're a price taker in good markets or bad markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=461.4s	461.4	 And it's just that I think that the prices now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=464.7s	464.7	 are coming down because what I've heard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=467.7s	467.7	 is that the crossover investors like Tiger,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=469.3s	469.3	 like Co2 who are deploying all this money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=471.8s	471.8	 they've really slowed down now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=474.4s	474.4	 I think they're all kind of licking their wounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=476.8s	476.8	 And so, like all of this money that was flooding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=479.4s	479.4	 into the venture space is kind of on pause right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=483.7s	483.7	 And that's caused the price levels to drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=486.2s	486.2	 The end of last year in Q4,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=489.1s	489.1	 my public portfolio really started to turn over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=492.8s	492.8	 Took a huge amount of losses going into the end of the year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=497.4s	497.4	 And then I took an accounting obviously of like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=499.0s	499.0	 the entire book and the public portfolio,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=502.9s	502.9	 every single thing that I owned ultimately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=504.8s	504.8	 basically broke even last year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=507.4s	507.4	 Some were up, I made some early sales.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=509.4s	509.4	 Some were way down by the end of the year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=511.1s	511.1	 Net, net, I kind of broke even.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=514.2s	514.2	 But my private book was up a billion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=516.5s	516.5	 And I told the team, I'm like, no, this is not real.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=519.6s	519.6	 So, we have to take those marks because, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=523.1s	523.1	 you have other venture firms that are pricing these deals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=525.5s	525.5	 and we get audited K1s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=526.9s	526.9	 And so we have to take the up billion, but I told them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=530.5s	530.5	 you should consider this that we had basically a down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=533.0s	533.0	 you know, so net, net, our returns were like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=535.2s	535.2	 we were up like 15%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=536.6s	536.6	 And I said, this is not real.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=538.1s	538.1	 We were at best break even and probably we lost money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=541.4s	541.4	 But you can't not take these marks because like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=544.1s	544.1	 you have an entire fund complex that lives on these marks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=548.6s	548.6	 Yeah, and by the way-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=549.4s	549.4	 It doesn't affect my compensation at all,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=550.6s	550.6	 but I have to take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=551.7s	551.7	 Freeberg then Sachs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=552.8s	552.8	 Go ahead, Freeberg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=553.6s	553.6	 No, it's a really important point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=554.5s	554.5	 because I think we talked about this one or two episodes ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=558.1s	558.1	 but there's a significant disincentive for venture firms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=561.7s	561.7	 to take markdowns, to raise capital into a private business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=565.5s	565.5	 at a price that's lower than the prior round.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=568.0s	568.0	 Because when they do that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=569.2s	569.2	 the marked value of their portfolio goes down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=572.8s	572.8	 And then it makes it harder for that venture firm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=574.7s	574.7	 to go out and raise the next fund
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=577.1s	577.1	 that they're gonna try and raise from their LPs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=579.4s	579.4	 Because it looks like they're not good investors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=581.2s	581.2	 And the reality is, and so in every round,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=583.7s	583.7	 as everyone on this pod knows,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=586.0s	586.0	 there's always an incentive and a push to see,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=587.9s	587.9	 can you get the valuation higher?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=589.7s	589.7	 Even if the business performance didn't meet the objectives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=592.2s	592.2	 of the prior round and things have gone sideways a bit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=595.0s	595.0	 doesn't necessarily mean that it's a bad business,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=597.5s	597.5	 but it doesn't necessarily mean that it should always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=599.6s	599.6	 be getting an up round just because it's being kept alive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=602.3s	602.3	 And there's this artificial pressure in private equity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=608.5s	608.5	 in venture to always drive the value up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=610.6s	610.6	 or to run away from the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=612.3s	612.3	 Because otherwise you're gonna have this markdown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=614.2s	614.2	 and you don't wanna be putting money in at a markdown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=615.8s	615.8	 that looks like a loser and so on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=617.6s	617.6	 And if you look at the public markets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=619.7s	619.7	 every successful company has had significant downturns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=622.9s	622.9	 in their stock for significant periods of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=625.9s	625.9	 From Apple to Google, to Facebook, to Amazon, to Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=630.5s	630.5	 And all of those businesses were sound businesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=633.1s	633.1	 It's just that for whatever reason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=634.4s	634.4	 there were perturbations in markets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=635.9s	635.9	 perturbations in the business,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=637.4s	637.4	 but the long-term value creation was still there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=639.7s	639.7	 And so I think we need to be really thoughtful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=644.4s	644.4	 and entrepreneurs should be very thoughtful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=646.6s	646.6	 not to give in to the venture mandate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=649.4s	649.4	 to always drive value up, but to be really thoughtful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=651.6s	651.6	 about getting the right valuation for your business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=653.2s	653.2	 and getting the capital you need with the right partners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=655.1s	655.1	 Can I say something about this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=656.6s	656.6	 It's so important what you said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=658.5s	658.5	 One of the tactics that I started three years ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=660.5s	660.5	 was I run my own shadow portfolio,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=663.7s	663.7	 where I don't take the marks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=665.4s	665.4	 and I just keep them at my cost basis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=668.0s	668.0	 And I'm not allowed to use that for anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=670.4s	670.4	 I can't use that, obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=672.2s	672.2	 I would never use that for compensation with my team
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=674.2s	674.2	 or anything else, but I use it in my own head to say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=676.9s	676.9	 okay, if I invested a dollar,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=679.2s	679.2	 let's not think about what somebody else may think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=681.9s	681.9	 about what that dollar's worth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=683.1s	683.1	 Let's just keep it at a dollar, unless it's impaired.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=686.0s	686.0	 But I don't take the markups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=687.8s	687.8	 And I look at my portfolio that way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=691.0s	691.0	 but it's a very difficult thing to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=692.6s	692.6	 And the reason I do that is because I don't have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=694.2s	694.2	 the pressure to raise incremental funds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=695.7s	695.7	 But if I did, I wouldn't be able to play that game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=698.2s	698.2	 And I'd be very focused on making sure other VCs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=702.2s	702.2	 marked up my deals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=703.1s	703.1	 Because to your point, it takes 10, 12 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=706.1s	706.1	 to drive liquidity, literally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=708.0s	708.0	 That's the key here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=709.3s	709.3	 And so what are you supposed to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=710.8s	710.8	 if you're a venture business in year three or four,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=712.8s	712.8	 except raise money on markups?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=714.7s	714.7	 Paper markups are the, they're the engine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=718.4s	718.4	 It's the lifeblood of what keeps this industry going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=721.0s	721.0	 Yeah, totally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=721.9s	721.9	 Well, I mean, the interesting thing for me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=723.6s	723.6	 is I LP'd a couple of these small emerging fund managers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=727.2s	727.2	 micro funds, 10 million or so, 3 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=730.0s	730.0	 And they were sending a lot of updates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=732.0s	732.0	 And so I'm in some top tier venture firms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=734.2s	734.2	 that some of you were in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=735.6s	735.6	 And they send you an audit every year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=737.6s	737.6	 and they send you a distribution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=738.7s	738.7	 Cash on cash, here's where you're at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=740.8s	740.8	 And then I was getting quarterly emails.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=743.6s	743.6	 As everything was going up, these new fund managers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=745.6s	745.6	 are like, we're at 100 IRR, we're at 200% IRR,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=748.8s	748.8	 because this crypto investment we did got marked up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=751.5s	751.5	 And I was just thinking about what Bill Gurley
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=753.0s	753.0	 would always say, which I think is a Howard Marks quote,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=755.3s	755.3	 you can't eat IRR.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=756.9s	756.9	 Like, what are we doing here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=758.2s	758.2	 Like, why is there such a focus on this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=759.9s	759.9	 It's because you want to raise your next fund.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=761.9s	761.9	 And then the other game people were playing was,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=764.8s	764.8	 and I got into this because people were like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=768.1s	768.1	 oh, you know, you're grossly undervaluing your funds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=773.2s	773.2	 because Robinhood is trading at $30 a share
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=776.2s	776.2	 on the private markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=777.2s	777.2	 Comm is trading at this in the private markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=778.9s	778.9	 And the second, people were using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=780.2s	780.2	 secondary market transactions as their mark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=782.8s	782.8	 So I'm curious, Sax, how do you think about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=785.4s	785.4	 if you invested in a company, the Series B
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=787.8s	787.8	 was $100 a share, but then somebody bought it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=789.6s	789.6	 at 150 a share in the private markets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=791.9s	791.9	 where do you like to mark that in your funds?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=793.8s	793.8	 Or how do you think about that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=795.3s	795.3	 and getting ahead of your skis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=796.5s	796.5	 in terms of valuing your private funds?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=799.3s	799.3	 Well, to Jermoss' points,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=800.8s	800.8	 we have accounting rules around this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=802.5s	802.5	 So we can't like subjectively decide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=805.5s	805.5	 like what mark to set for each company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=808.7s	808.7	 for obvious reasons, RLP want like a predictable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=812.8s	812.8	 accounting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=813.9s	813.9	 So the way it generally works is that you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=817.6s	817.6	 the mark is set by the most recent private, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=820.8s	820.8	 financing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=823.2s	823.2	 This is the way it works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=824.2s	824.2	 And if people want to discount it from there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=825.9s	825.9	 they certainly can, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=827.4s	827.4	 What about a secondary transaction?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=829.0s	829.0	 Is there any?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=830.2s	830.2	 More complicated rules around that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=831.8s	831.8	 because it's a different class of stock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=833.3s	833.3	 So it's some combination of, sometimes we use a 49A,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=837.4s	837.4	 sometimes it's the latest preferred round.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=839.4s	839.4	 It's, you know, it just,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=842.0s	842.0	 there's like complicated rules around it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=844.2s	844.2	 By the way, I'll just rehash what was already said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=847.9s	847.9	 And just to say it one more time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=849.1s	849.1	 Jermoss pointed out that it typically takes 12 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=851.3s	851.3	 to liquidity from the time a startup is initially funded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=854.0s	854.0	 to the time that you sell it or go public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=856.9s	856.9	 Show me one public company that has had 12 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=860.2s	860.2	 of consistent gain in its stock price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=862.8s	862.8	 It doesn't exist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=864.1s	864.1	 And so again, like this notion that, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=867.1s	867.1	 every startup is seeing some perpetual persistent increase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=870.1s	870.1	 in value is an artifice that doesn't really represent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=874.6s	874.6	 It doesn't exist in tech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=876.2s	876.2	 And that's a feature, not a bug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=878.2s	878.2	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=879.0s	879.0	 Meaning the things that can go up predictably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=880.5s	880.5	 for 10 to 12 years are not necessarily businesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=883.2s	883.2	 They're not disruptive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=884.0s	884.0	 They don't take risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=884.9s	884.9	 They're not dynamic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=886.0s	886.0	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=886.9s	886.9	 They don't take risk, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=887.7s	887.7	 Sax, can you define perturbation for the audience?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=890.1s	890.1	 I heard Freberg say that a couple of times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=892.8s	892.8	 Perturbation would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=894.2s	894.2	 Perturbation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=895.1s	895.1	 Pursing changes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=896.1s	896.1	 What, like volatility basically?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=897.4s	897.4	 Yeah, rapid change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=898.2s	898.2	 Anxiety, mental uneasiness?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=901.5s	901.5	 Okay, a cause of anxiety or uneasiness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=903.4s	903.4	 Okay, I got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=904.6s	904.6	 I thought you were saying another word.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=906.0s	906.0	 You don't use the word perturbation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=908.2s	908.2	 I thought you said another word.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=910.6s	910.6	 What word was in your brain?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=911.8s	911.8	 I thought I heard masturbation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=914.4s	914.4	 I was like, wait a second, what exactly did he say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=917.4s	917.4	 about the markets?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=920.1s	920.1	 Speaking of markets, we were on our text thread
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=924.4s	924.4	 talking about if we're about to have the start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=928.2s	928.2	 of World War III, and then maybe this is not in the news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=936.0s	936.0	 How do we look at the UK, Russia situation in the Ukraine?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=940.2s	940.2	 Obviously, 100,000 troops are amassing on a border.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=944.5s	944.5	 And what is the goal here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=947.0s	947.0	 Because Biden is saying, hey, listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=950.3s	950.3	 if anything happens, we're gonna go to war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=952.9s	952.9	 And there's a lot of saber rattling here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=955.0s	955.0	 I don't exactly understand what Putin's goal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=958.0s	958.0	 or motivation is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=958.8s	958.8	 And that's, I think, what I'm not hearing in the news
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=961.8s	961.8	 is exactly what is his goal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=963.2s	963.2	 What are your thoughts on what's happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=965.4s	965.4	 in the Ukraine and Russia sex?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=969.7s	969.7	 Okay, well, I think first of all, we have to kind of level
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=973.2s	973.2	 set in historical terms about how unusual and unprecedented
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=976.6s	976.6	 it would be for us to send troops to fight, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=982.2s	982.2	 potentially Russia in a border conflict with Ukraine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=986.3s	986.3	 And by the way, Biden put 8,500 troops on alert
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=989.7s	989.7	 for deployment this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=992.3s	992.3	 It's really without historical precedent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=995.6s	995.6	 During the Cold War, you know, in 1956, Soviet tanks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1000.2s	1000.2	 rolled into Hungary to crush rebels there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1002.4s	1002.4	 Eisenhower did nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1003.7s	1003.7	 1968, Soviet tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1006.4s	1006.4	 to crush the Prague Spring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1007.8s	1007.8	 LBJ did nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1009.2s	1009.2	 1981, the Soviets crushed the Solidarity Movement in Poland.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1014.4s	1014.4	 Ronald Reagan did nothing, even though he had campaigned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1017.4s	1017.4	 on getting tough with the Soviets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1019.3s	1019.3	 And then more recently in 2008, when Russia invaded Georgia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1025.7s	1025.7	 George W. Bush did not intervene militarily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1028.1s	1028.1	 And then in 2014, when Putin occupied Crimea,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1033.8s	1033.8	 Obama did nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1034.9s	1034.9	 And so this idea, and the reason for that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1037.4s	1037.4	 in all of those cases is because America
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1040.4s	1040.4	 has a vital national interest in avoiding war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1043.6s	1043.6	 with a nuclear armed Russia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1045.3s	1045.3	 And we did not have a vital national interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1048.0s	1048.0	 in defending the territorial sovereignty of those nations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1052.6s	1052.6	 That's the bottom line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1054.0s	1054.0	 And so for us to be now beating the drums of war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1058.2s	1058.2	 and talking about sending troops into a war zone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1061.4s	1061.4	 with Russia is just, it's unbelievably irresponsible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1066.0s	1066.0	 Friedberg, one might speculate if they were cynical,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1070.5s	1070.5	 some sort of wag the dog situation here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1072.9s	1072.9	 Biden's not doing well, he's lowest popularity ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1076.9s	1076.9	 Midterms are coming up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1078.6s	1078.6	 Is there any political motivation here, do you think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1081.2s	1081.2	 in what Biden's actions are, given the context
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1083.8s	1083.8	 of what Sachs just outlined?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1085.6s	1085.6	 I think that there's, this is like showing up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1088.8s	1088.8	 to the last 20 minutes of a two hour movie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1092.1s	1092.1	 and then saying, oh my gosh, what's this guy doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1094.1s	1094.1	 He's so crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1095.2s	1095.2	 There's a long narrative that precedes the current news cycle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1099.0s	1099.0	 on what's happening with Putin and the Ukraine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1102.6s	1102.6	 In large part, the United States helped to start the fuel,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1106.7s	1106.7	 the expansion of NATO in the 90s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1109.5s	1109.5	 And the intention was to make NATO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1112.2s	1112.2	 as a Western allied kind of organization contain Russia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1117.4s	1117.4	 step up right to their borders, get very close
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1119.9s	1119.9	 and ultimately make these kind of areas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1125.9s	1125.9	 liberal democracies that are aligned with the West
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1129.1s	1129.1	 and put them right on Russia's border.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1131.0s	1131.0	 And that is obviously antagonistic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1134.9s	1134.9	 If anyone tried to do that to the United States,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1137.2s	1137.2	 like Russia did with the Cuban missile crisis,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1140.5s	1140.5	 we would view that as a hostile act
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1142.9s	1142.9	 and we would react accordingly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1144.8s	1144.8	 And for years, the pressure has been building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1147.2s	1147.2	 and has been mounting as Putin has started
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1149.8s	1149.8	 to kind of solidify his political power at home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1153.4s	1153.4	 and his allies abroad in trying to figure out ways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1156.9s	1156.9	 to push back on this wall that has been built around him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1160.4s	1160.4	 and his nation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1161.5s	1161.5	 And to some degree, I think we look at this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1163.9s	1163.9	 as like his aggressive behavior, but to some extent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1168.0s	1168.0	 it is a defensive behavior over a very longer cycle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1171.3s	1171.3	 when viewed that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1174.1s	1174.1	 And again, like remember the US had this Monroe doctrine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1177.0s	1177.0	 which president Monroe put in place in, I don't know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1179.0s	1179.0	 1800 something that said, anyone that comes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1182.4s	1182.4	 into our territory and tries to influence nations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1185.9s	1185.9	 around us to be hostile towards us is a hostile act
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1189.0s	1189.0	 in and of itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1189.8s	1189.8	 Anytime someone tries to influence our politics, it's hostile.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1192.8s	1192.8	 And I think Russia views our behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1194.8s	1194.8	 and NATO's behavior this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1196.0s	1196.0	 And so his primary demand is and has always been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1199.4s	1199.4	 that the Ukraine cannot and will not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1201.2s	1201.2	 and should not join NATO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1202.6s	1202.6	 And the US response has and continues to be-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1205.1s	1205.1	 And the EU.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1206.2s	1206.2	 And the EU, and we're saying, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1209.4s	1209.4	 we believe in the sovereignty of the Ukraine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1211.8s	1211.8	 and we want the Ukraine to make their own decision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1213.4s	1213.4	 about where they go and what they do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1215.0s	1215.0	 But the reality is for us, this is a key part
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1217.5s	1217.5	 of a very long-term strategy to keep Russia contained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1220.4s	1220.4	 Now, meanwhile, there's this beautiful backdrop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1222.8s	1222.8	 of what's going on with China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1224.8s	1224.8	 And if I'm China, I would love to see the US
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1227.6s	1227.6	 and Russia in conflict because it will weaken the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1230.5s	1230.5	 And if I'm Russia, I would love to see the US
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1232.3s	1232.3	 and China in conflict because it will weaken the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1235.2s	1235.2	 The US is in a very precarious situation right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1237.5s	1237.5	 And for us to actually end up in conflict
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1239.2s	1239.2	 is gonna weaken our position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1240.3s	1240.3	 with one of these other two emerging,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1242.1s	1242.1	 challenging superpowers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1245.8s	1245.8	 And this is a really precarious time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1247.7s	1247.7	 I think to Sachs's point, it's highly unlikely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1250.0s	1250.0	 we're gonna end up sending military.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1251.6s	1251.6	 But the posturing is such that we need to kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1254.1s	1254.1	 hold our line until the very last minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1256.1s	1256.1	 We'll see what happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1257.0s	1257.0	 I did say, at the end of the year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1259.2s	1259.2	 I do think that we're in this kind of economic status
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1262.0s	1262.0	 right now that if there were an opportunity for conflict,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1265.6s	1265.6	 we're probably more likely to wanna engage in conflict
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1267.7s	1267.7	 than not because it does create something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1270.9s	1270.9	 that we all get behind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1271.7s	1271.7	 It creates kind of a political unity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1273.5s	1273.5	 It creates economic unity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1274.7s	1274.7	 It creates driving forces that maybe might help us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1277.8s	1277.8	 through what is clearly a very volatile
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1279.6s	1279.6	 and difficult time at home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1281.8s	1281.8	 So let's see what happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1283.8s	1283.8	 I think Obama's already given us the end game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1285.9s	1285.9	 I just think we have to go through the machinations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1288.1s	1288.1	 to get there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1288.9s	1288.9	 He said to the Atlantic, I think it was in 2016 or 17,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1291.9s	1291.9	 he said, the fact is that Ukraine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1293.5s	1293.5	 which is a non-NATO country,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1294.7s	1294.7	 is going to be vulnerable to military domination by Russia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1297.5s	1297.5	 no matter what we do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1298.8s	1298.8	 And every time there was this brinksmanship,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1301.2s	1301.2	 we effectively blinked and rightfully so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1303.7s	1303.7	 because it didn't necessarily make sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1305.6s	1305.6	 to all of a sudden engage the war machine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1308.6s	1308.6	 to go to war in Eastern Europe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1312.1s	1312.1	 The thing that's interesting about what happened here though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1314.4s	1314.4	 was that this was a slow moving train wreck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1316.6s	1316.6	 that was really visible years and years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1318.9s	1318.9	 Why is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1320.1s	1320.1	 Well, if you look at what was really happening,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1322.8s	1322.8	 this is really a European issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1325.0s	1325.0	 And you gotta think, well, why is America
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1327.8s	1327.8	 the leading actor here when,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1330.2s	1330.2	 where's Europe in all of this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1331.6s	1331.6	 Well, it turns out that the strongest power in Europe,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1336.0s	1336.0	 Germany, is in a really difficult situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1339.1s	1339.1	 because they rely on Russian energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1342.5s	1342.5	 50% of the Nat gas that comes in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1346.4s	1346.4	 or 50% of the energy, I think, that comes into Germany
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1348.8s	1348.8	 is from Russia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1350.3s	1350.3	 And they've in fact been building an entire pipeline system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1355.4s	1355.4	 from Russia that bypasses the Ukraine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1357.5s	1357.5	 and goes straight to Germany.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1359.1s	1359.1	 And so when all of the saber rattling was happening,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1361.3s	1361.3	 Germany basically had to blink
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1362.9s	1362.9	 because they need Russia's energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1365.2s	1365.2	 And why did they need Russia's energy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1367.4s	1367.4	 Well, they needed Russia's energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1368.5s	1368.5	 because 20 years ago, the environmentalists in Germany won
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1371.5s	1371.5	 and they started to decommission all their nuclear reactors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1374.0s	1374.0	 So ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1375.7s	1375.7	 So at somewhere along the way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1377.2s	1377.2	 nobody took a science class in Germany
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1379.3s	1379.3	 and figured out that nuclear was both safer and cleaner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1382.7s	1382.7	 Instead, burning fossil fuels was the answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1384.8s	1384.8	 Wiser to not have a dependency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1387.2s	1387.2	 And after the Fukushima, they went, turned them all off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1390.0s	1390.0	 They accelerated it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1391.0s	1391.0	 Yeah, it made more sense to burn fossil fuels, number one,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1394.0s	1394.0	 and then to get those fossil fuels from Russia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1397.4s	1397.4	 So unfortunately, we are in the state of affairs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1399.9s	1399.9	 where Germany has said, at least it's been reported,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1404.6s	1404.6	 that they would shut down this pipeline, Nord Stream 2,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1407.1s	1407.1	 if Russia did something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1409.2s	1409.2	 But the reality is, I think Obama basically told us that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1412.6s	1412.6	 it's going to be very difficult for us to justify
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1414.8s	1414.8	 and act like this, especially against somebody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1417.0s	1417.0	 who is fortified and clever and smart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1419.7s	1419.7	 This is not like invading the Middle East.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1421.3s	1421.3	 And so, if this happens, the stock markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1425.4s	1425.4	 will just go absolutely to zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1427.8s	1427.8	 I mean, if you could have negative stock prices,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1430.2s	1430.2	 this may be a good catalyst.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1431.0s	1431.0	 We'll pay you to take these Netflix shares, please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1434.2s	1434.2	 That's unbelievable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1435.8s	1435.8	 It's really, really crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1437.9s	1437.9	 This seems like a situation where we're assured
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1440.7s	1440.7	 not to get into, to mix it up with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1443.6s	1443.6	 Like, I don't understand Putin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1445.7s	1445.7	 I don't understand Biden saying that he's absolutely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1448.7s	1448.7	 going to react to this, because we're not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1452.2s	1452.2	 We can't afford to get into a war right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1454.4s	1454.4	 That's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1455.2s	1455.2	 And if that is true, then, you know, US dominance,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1458.8s	1458.8	 the US ability to hold the line starts to decline.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1462.4s	1462.4	 And then-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1463.2s	1463.2	 Well, I don't know if I agree with that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1464.9s	1464.9	 because I think we could diffuse this crisis very easily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1469.5s	1469.5	 Which is-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1470.4s	1470.4	 What's the exit ramp?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1471.2s	1471.2	 Yeah, tell us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1472.0s	1472.0	 Well, the exit ramp here is, what is Putin demanding?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1475.1s	1475.1	 Putin is demanding that we affirm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1478.1s	1478.1	 that Ukraine will not be part of NATO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1480.8s	1480.8	 In my view- Sure, let's do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1481.9s	1481.9	 In my view, that's giving him the sleeves off our vest,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1484.6s	1484.6	 because we should not want to add Ukraine or Georgia to NATO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1490.2s	1490.2	 That would do nothing to enhance the security
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1492.0s	1492.0	 of the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1492.8s	1492.8	 We wouldn't get anything out of it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1493.8s	1493.8	 but we would be obligated under Article 5-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1496.9s	1496.9	 To defend them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1497.8s	1497.8	 Exactly, to defend them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1498.8s	1498.8	 So admitting Ukraine or Georgia or Moldova
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1502.6s	1502.6	 could ultimately bring us into a war with Russia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1506.2s	1506.2	 Invite antagonism too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1507.1s	1507.1	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1508.2s	1508.2	 So to Freeberg's point earlier,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1510.6s	1510.6	 we have been poking the bear for two decades
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1513.6s	1513.6	 with our expansion of NATO right up to Russia's front porch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1517.9s	1517.9	 And if you go all the way back to 1990,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1519.9s	1519.9	 when George Herbert Walker Bush was president
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1522.0s	1522.0	 and James Baker was secretary of state,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1524.2s	1524.2	 there was an assurance made by James Baker that, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1527.8s	1527.8	 basically they had gone to Gorbachev and said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1531.2s	1531.2	 for help in reunifying Germany.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1534.5s	1534.5	 And the promise made that famously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1536.3s	1536.3	 that James Baker said is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1538.0s	1538.0	 what Gorbachev said is we don't want NATO expansion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1540.7s	1540.7	 And Baker apparently said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1542.3s	1542.3	 not one inch eastward was the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1545.6s	1545.6	 And we think back to how well Herbert Walker Bush
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1550.6s	1550.6	 and James Baker managed the end of the Cold War.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1552.4s	1552.4	 How did they do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1553.3s	1553.3	 They did that by making assurances to Russia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1556.8s	1556.8	 that we would not bring NATO up to their front porch,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1559.4s	1559.4	 which is what we did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1560.4s	1560.4	 In 2000, we've now added something like 14 countries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1563.7s	1563.7	 in Eastern Europe to, you know, to NATO,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1567.8s	1567.8	 including in 2004, the Baltic countries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1570.2s	1570.2	 And that decision by George W. Bush really is the thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1573.9s	1573.9	 that pretty much severed our relationship with Putin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1577.1s	1577.1	 You have to remember that Putin is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1580.0s	1580.0	 he is fairly popular in Russia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1581.6s	1581.6	 because he stokes Russian nationalism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1584.1s	1584.1	 And what is the source of that nationalism?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1586.2s	1586.2	 It is because a single tree organization, NATO,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1589.6s	1589.6	 now has this huge contiguous border with Russia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1593.4s	1593.4	 They now feel encircled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1595.8s	1595.8	 And if we were to add Ukraine to that organization,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1599.7s	1599.7	 there'd be a 1200 mile, again, border,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1602.7s	1602.7	 which that Russia would have with just this one alliance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1607.8s	1607.8	 It would be akin to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1609.6s	1609.6	 imagine if we were still in the Cold War
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1611.7s	1611.7	 and Canada were added to the Warsaw Pact, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1615.3s	1615.3	 I mean, we would be incredibly threatened by that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1618.1s	1618.1	 So, and so, but, you know, you never hear,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1620.6s	1620.6	 Jake, you never hear any of this on the news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1622.5s	1622.5	 All you hear is the beating of the war drums
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1625.2s	1625.2	 and Putin is portrayed as this mad dictator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1627.6s	1627.6	 He has no legitimate concerns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1629.2s	1629.2	 Now look, Putin is an authoritarian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1631.7s	1631.7	 and you could describe him as a bully and a thug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1634.1s	1634.1	 And he has provoked this-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1635.2s	1635.2	 He's a dictator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1636.1s	1636.1	 He has provoked this situation, certainly, okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1639.1s	1639.1	 But, you know, we treat him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1641.6s	1641.6	 as if he has no valid concerns whatsoever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1644.8s	1644.8	 And I think the simplest thing to do to defuse this crisis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1647.6s	1647.6	 would simply be to say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1648.8s	1648.8	 yes, we have no intention of adding Ukraine to NATO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1652.0s	1652.0	 And then we will find out if Putin is a liar or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1654.6s	1654.6	 Well, that would be a great move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1655.6s	1655.6	 Like it's a, that would be like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1656.7s	1656.7	 hey, let's take a five year pause.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1658.0s	1658.0	 Okay, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1658.8s	1658.8	 We'll negotiate with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1659.7s	1659.7	 We'll take five years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1660.5s	1660.5	 We won't put him in NATO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1661.6s	1661.6	 Give a little bit of a concession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1663.6s	1663.6	 because their country is not doing well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1665.3s	1665.3	 Their GDP trails China and the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1667.8s	1667.8	 Their GDP per, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1671.0s	1671.0	 each citizen is incredibly low compared to the West.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1674.2s	1674.2	 And then we could just work with Germany
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1675.5s	1675.5	 to get on sustainability, which is what their goal is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1678.7s	1678.7	 And we could economically continue to trounce them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1682.2s	1682.2	 Because as you point out every week, Chamath,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1684.7s	1684.7	 they're not an important economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1686.2s	1686.2	 Here's what Obama said about Putin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1688.7s	1688.7	 Obama said, the truth is actually,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1690.5s	1690.5	 Putin in all of our meetings is scrupulously polite,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1693.0s	1693.0	 very frank.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1693.8s	1693.8	 Our meetings are very business-like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1695.2s	1695.2	 He never keeps me waiting two hours
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1696.9s	1696.9	 like he does a bunch of these other folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1699.0s	1699.0	 He's constantly interested in being seen as our peer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1702.8s	1702.8	 and as working with us because he's not completely stupid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1705.7s	1705.7	 He understands that Russia's overall position in the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1708.9s	1708.9	 is significantly diminished.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1710.4s	1710.4	 Yeah, he's not crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1712.2s	1712.2	 He's not dumb.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1713.2s	1713.2	 And by the way, nationalism, as Sachs points out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1715.7s	1715.7	 which is a primary, you know, drum call for Putin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1721.4s	1721.4	 is not a novel sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1723.2s	1723.2	 We are a nationalist country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1725.6s	1725.6	 Nationalism is, you know, pride and wanting to make sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1730.0s	1730.0	 that your country is treated with respect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1732.4s	1732.4	 and has sovereignty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1733.7s	1733.7	 And so I don't think that Putin is an irrational actor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1736.1s	1736.1	 His behavior is very rational in response
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1738.0s	1738.0	 to what's gone on for 30 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1739.8s	1739.8	 And his requests are that he is feeling threatened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1741.8s	1741.8	 and he is trying to avoid military conflict
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1744.2s	1744.2	 as much as he can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1745.2s	1745.2	 And we portray him as being an aggressor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1747.7s	1747.7	 that's demanding military conflict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1749.2s	1749.2	 And at the end of the day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1750.3s	1750.3	 our behavior over a long period of time as a country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1752.9s	1752.9	 has driven us to the brink here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1754.5s	1754.5	 And I think Sachs is right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1755.8s	1755.8	 You know, the right decision may very well be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1758.6s	1758.6	 to kind of, you know, leave the region alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1761.5s	1761.5	 and focus on issues that matter more deeply to us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1764.5s	1764.5	 and are a higher priority rather than drawing us into this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1766.6s	1766.6	 But-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1767.4s	1767.4	 A better investment would be in sustainable energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1769.4s	1769.4	 I think the economic seed is planted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1770.9s	1770.9	 for us to be in some sort of conflict this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1772.6s	1772.6	 So, you know, we're gonna end up-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1774.2s	1774.2	 Yeah, I know what you mean by that, Freberg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1775.9s	1775.9	 Economic seed to be in some sort of conflict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1778.2s	1778.2	 I think that, you know, generally,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1780.0s	1780.0	 if you're not gonna see homegrown, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1783.0s	1783.0	 economic productivity gains
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1784.9s	1784.9	 and you're suffering trade issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1786.5s	1786.5	 like we're gonna suffer this year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1787.6s	1787.6	 given the supply chain problems globally,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1789.7s	1789.7	 we're gonna look for some place to manufacture growth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1793.3s	1793.3	 And there's no better way to manufacture growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1795.8s	1795.8	 than through-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1796.7s	1796.7	 Like the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1797.5s	1797.5	 Through conflict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1798.3s	1798.3	 The foreign policy establishment in Washington,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1800.4s	1800.4	 you know, the neocons, the so-called Washington blob.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1803.4s	1803.4	 I mean, here they are beating the drums for war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1805.4s	1805.4	 We haven't been in a war for what, six months?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1807.2s	1807.2	 We just got out of Afghanistan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1808.6s	1808.6	 and now they want us back in another war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1810.8s	1810.8	 And the media just keeps fueling and fomenting this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1814.9s	1814.9	 and they don't, you know, their coverage of it is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1818.0s	1818.0	 well, it's exactly what we talked about last week,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1820.5s	1820.5	 Jake Howell, when I pointed out that your rhetoric,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1822.7s	1822.7	 your humanitarian rhetoric,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1824.0s	1824.0	 as noble as the sentiments are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1826.2s	1826.2	 when it gets whipped up into a lather and a frenzy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1829.3s	1829.3	 by the media, it blunders us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1831.4s	1831.4	 into a bunch of stupid foreign interventions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1833.2s	1833.2	 I would not call it rhetoric.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1834.1s	1834.1	 Let's call it beliefs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1835.3s	1835.3	 My beliefs are not rhetoric, but I get your point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1838.1s	1838.1	 Is there any-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1838.9s	1838.9	 But here we are one week later
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1839.7s	1839.7	 and exactly what I said the risk of this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1841.9s	1841.9	 has now materialized-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1842.8s	1842.8	 Okay, so clearly you're blaming my position on human rights
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1845.4s	1845.4	 on the run of the conflict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1846.3s	1846.3	 No, what I'm saying is that this type of rhetoric
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1848.7s	1848.7	 is used by the military industrial complex
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1851.6s	1851.6	 and the washer blob and the neocons to stampede us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1854.7s	1854.7	 into wars that don't make any sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1857.1s	1857.1	 That's what I predicted a week ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1858.5s	1858.5	 That's, or that was my concern.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1860.0s	1860.0	 Well, the death that would occur-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1860.8s	1860.8	 And here we are one week later
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1861.8s	1861.8	 and we're in exactly that situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1863.2s	1863.2	 It is our most successful export.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1865.4s	1865.4	 It is our most successful export.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1867.4s	1867.4	 Jake Howell, really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1868.4s	1868.4	 There's a difference between belief
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1871.7s	1871.7	 and how do you act on that belief
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1873.1s	1873.1	 and what are your actions based on that belief?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1874.4s	1874.4	 100%, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1875.2s	1875.2	 And I think that a big part of what's gone on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1877.1s	1877.1	 this harkens back to a few episodes ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1878.8s	1878.8	 when we all got in trouble,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1881.4s	1881.4	 there was an attempt of canceling us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1882.6s	1882.6	 after we spoke about this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1884.3s	1884.3	 but when those beliefs are-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1886.6s	1886.6	 Here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1887.5s	1887.5	 As Sacks pointed out, harness in a way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1888.9s	1888.9	 that is ultimately- Co-opted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1891.0s	1891.0	 Co-opted in a way to fuel and to drive conflict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1896.4s	1896.4	 It obviously goes beyond belief
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1899.0s	1899.0	 and it starts to move into an area
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1900.3s	1900.3	 where there is a very wide spectrum of action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1903.0s	1903.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1903.8s	1903.8	 And it's very easy to tip yourself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1905.4s	1905.4	 onto the one side of the spectrum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1907.2s	1907.2	 And as a result, caused a lot of harm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1909.0s	1909.0	 and a lot of damage like we've done in Afghanistan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1910.8s	1910.8	 like we've done in Iraq.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1912.0s	1912.0	 Here's a great lens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1913.4s	1913.4	 What is the cost of going to war in the Ukraine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1915.6s	1915.6	 versus whatever human rights or sovereignty issues they have?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1919.2s	1919.2	 Hundreds of thousands of troops going to war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1922.1s	1922.1	 is gonna result in more human suffering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1924.3s	1924.3	 than what's currently happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1925.1s	1925.1	 Including for Ukraine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1926.3s	1926.3	 It's sort of- Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1927.6s	1927.6	 They're gonna be in the middle of a,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1929.6s	1929.6	 the war is gonna happen on their turf.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1931.7s	1931.7	 The humanitarian interest is in diffusing the situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1936.0s	1936.0	 and the way to do it in a way is to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1939.4s	1939.4	 is to, you know, exceed to this one demand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1942.7s	1942.7	 that Putin has about not emitting Ukraine to NATO,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1945.8s	1945.8	 which just to say something more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1947.3s	1947.3	 about why we shouldn't want that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1949.4s	1949.4	 The problem in Ukraine and Georgia and Moldova,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1954.7s	1954.7	 first of all, these are not North Atlantic countries, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1957.7s	1957.7	 This is mission creep by NATO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1959.2s	1959.2	 They're in the caucuses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1960.8s	1960.8	 And the problem they have is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1962.1s	1962.1	 they're sort of these breakaway, you know, Russian republics,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1964.8s	1964.8	 but inside of these countries, there's breakaway provinces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1970.1s	1970.1	 You know, they're ethnically Russian areas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1973.1s	1973.1	 within these countries that wanna break away from them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1976.8s	1976.8	 So you have a breakaway within the breakaway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1979.0s	1979.0	 And so you've got these powerful forces-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1981.1s	1981.1	 It's complicated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1982.0s	1982.0	 It's very complicated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1982.8s	1982.8	 So for example, in Georgia in 2008,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1985.9s	1985.9	 when there was a war there and Russia did invade Georgia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1989.0s	1989.0	 but it was on behalf of these breakaway provinces
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1991.6s	1991.6	 of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=1994.3s	1994.3	 And then in Ukraine, they've got the Donbass and Crimea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2000.5s	2000.5	 which has now been annexed by Russia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2003.2s	2003.2	 which are these majority ethnically Russian areas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2008.0s	2008.0	 You know, and same problem in Moldova.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2011.8s	2011.8	 So the problem is you've got these like incredibly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2014.6s	2014.6	 complicated border disputes within these countries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2018.3s	2018.3	 based on ethno-nationalist tribalism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2021.3s	2021.3	 And, you know-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2022.5s	2022.5	 Sounds familiar, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2023.8s	2023.8	 The U.S. does not have a vital national interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2026.3s	2026.3	 in getting involved in those disputes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2028.1s	2028.1	 And by admitting these countries into NATO,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2030.2s	2030.2	 they could pull us into those disputes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2032.0s	2032.0	 because the key provision, Article 5 of NATO,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2034.8s	2034.8	 says an attack on one is an attack on all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2036.9s	2036.9	 We're obligated to go to the defense of those nations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2040.1s	2040.1	 How is the security of the United States enhanced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2043.0s	2043.0	 by that requirement?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2044.2s	2044.2	 They get a lot out of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2045.4s	2045.4	 We don't get anything out of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2046.8s	2046.8	 So again- This is slightly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2047.6s	2047.6	 this is a distinctly different than say Taiwan is an issue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2050.7s	2050.7	 but let's put that aside and we'll get to that in a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2054.7s	2054.7	 If China and Russia and the United States
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2057.7s	2057.7	 are in this very complicated chessboard,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2059.5s	2059.5	 is there a way not only to defuse this situation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2062.7s	2062.7	 but is there a way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2063.6s	2063.6	 and I know this sounds like a crazy Hail Mary,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2066.0s	2066.0	 to deepen the relationship with Putin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2068.4s	2068.4	 and make Russia and the United States in some way allies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2072.8s	2072.8	 against this relationship with China?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2074.6s	2074.6	 Because the Russia-China relationship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2076.2s	2076.2	 is also very complex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2077.7s	2077.7	 Is there some path to us having a better relationship?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2081.3s	2081.3	 Xi is holding a summit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2083.8s	2083.8	 The last person he saw in real life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2086.0s	2086.0	 was the leader of Pakistan in 2020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2090.3s	2090.3	 before the pandemic started.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2091.6s	2091.6	 Do you know who he's meeting with in two weeks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2093.0s	2093.0	 before the Olympics start or in a week?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2094.5s	2094.5	 It's Putin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2095.6s	2095.6	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2096.8s	2096.8	 In person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2098.4s	2098.4	 And then there's gonna be a tripartite alliance conference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2102.8s	2102.8	 between China, Russia and Iran.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2106.2s	2106.2	 Great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2107.0s	2107.0	 So I think this idea that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2112.2s	2112.2	 all of a sudden somebody's gonna find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2114.4s	2114.4	 some holier than thou perspective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2116.2s	2116.2	 on what the right thing to do is for other people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2118.8s	2118.8	 is gonna be challenged.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2120.2s	2120.2	 So those guys are gonna think about themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2123.6s	2123.6	 And they're creating alliances
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2125.1s	2125.1	 to basically further advance their own objectives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2127.8s	2127.8	 And so I think we have to as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2130.1s	2130.1	 The thing here, I think what deescalates all of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2133.6s	2133.6	 is economic sanctions and monetary impact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2136.9s	2136.9	 Because if Nord Stream 2 doesn't get turned on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2140.4s	2140.4	 which is in Germany's control,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2142.4s	2142.4	 that has a huge economic impact to Russia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2144.4s	2144.4	 Explain what it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2145.4s	2145.4	 Nord Stream 2 is that pipeline that I just talked about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2147.5s	2147.5	 the Natgas pipeline that basically doubles
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2150.1s	2150.1	 the amount of Natgas flowing from Russia into Germany
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2153.4s	2153.4	 and essentially into all of Europe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2156.2s	2156.2	 But hasn't Germany said if they invade the Ukraine?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2158.7s	2158.7	 They haven't said it on the record.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2161.0s	2161.0	 It is thought that Chancellor Schultz,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2164.5s	2164.5	 that it's theoretically on the table,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2167.2s	2167.2	 but it hasn't been officially declared.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2169.2s	2169.2	 Biden today said that he's talked,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2172.2s	2172.2	 or somebody in the White House has talked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2175.1s	2175.1	 to all the major banks in the US
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2176.5s	2176.5	 about crippling economic sanctions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2178.3s	2178.3	 So I do think the way this gets deescalated is through money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2182.4s	2182.4	 And if you severely impinge Russia's ability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2186.2s	2186.2	 to sort of grow their economy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2188.1s	2188.1	 that foments a lot of anger at home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2191.9s	2191.9	 And I don't think that that'll probably weaken
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2194.8s	2194.8	 and destabilize Putin more than,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2199.5s	2199.5	 trying to sort of have a, I don't know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2201.8s	2201.8	 some kind of like get together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2203.9s	2203.9	 and hug it out session with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2206.3s	2206.3	 Yeah, I mean, so Jason, you raise a good point with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2209.5s	2209.5	 can we improve our relationship with Putin?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2211.4s	2211.4	 Obama tried, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2212.5s	2212.5	 We had the whole reset
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2214.4s	2214.4	 and ultimately it wasn't tremendously successful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2216.7s	2216.7	 But I think a lot of it has to do with the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2220.0s	2220.0	 that the foreign policy established from Washington
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2223.1s	2223.1	 sort of reacts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2224.9s	2224.9	 And Obama had some really good quotes about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2228.6s	2228.6	 I think it was in that Atlantic article where,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2230.8s	2230.8	 first he described that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2233.4s	2233.4	 that Russia has a vital interest in Ukraine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2237.2s	2237.2	 in a way we don't because it's right there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2238.6s	2238.6	 it's on their border.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2239.5s	2239.5	 They've been attacked, Russia has through the Ukraine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2243.2s	2243.2	 throughout history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2244.4s	2244.4	 So again, it's just a primary interest of theirs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2248.3s	2248.3	 And so after saying that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2250.4s	2250.4	 I think Obama then,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2254.0s	2254.0	 he basically got attacked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2257.8s	2257.8	 by, in a, but it was, some of it was partisan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2261.1s	2261.1	 but, and then he responded to the attacks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2263.4s	2263.4	 by saying if there's someone in this town,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2264.9s	2264.9	 Washington DC, that would claim
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2267.2s	2267.2	 that we would consider going to war with Russia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2269.1s	2269.1	 over Crimea and Eastern Ukraine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2271.0s	2271.0	 they should speak up and be very clear about it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2273.2s	2273.2	 that he challenged.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2274.5s	2274.5	 And then he said, so the issue, and no one did, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2277.9s	2277.9	 No one was willing to just come right out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2280.0s	2280.0	 and say that we should go to war over this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2282.6s	2282.6	 And that's how he defused the attacks on himself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2284.7s	2284.7	 And then Obama continued,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2286.0s	2286.0	 he said there's a playbook in Washington
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2287.6s	2287.6	 that presidents are supposed to follow,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2289.6s	2289.6	 and the playbook prescribes responses to different events.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2292.1s	2292.1	 And these responses tend to be militarized responses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2294.7s	2294.7	 You're judged harshly if you don't follow the playbook,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2297.3s	2297.3	 even if there are good reasons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2298.4s	2298.4	 So what Obama is saying is that no one would defend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2302.6s	2302.6	 a more militarized posture and going to war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2306.9s	2306.9	 against Russia over the Crimea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2308.8s	2308.8	 And yet he was somehow portrayed as suspect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2312.8s	2312.8	 by not being tough enough on Russia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2315.7s	2315.7	 And so if you're Putin and you see constantly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2320.8s	2320.8	 the foreign policy establishment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2323.4s	2323.4	 reacting in this way, it's not a problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2325.8s	2325.8	 that even one president can just fix overnight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2328.2s	2328.2	 You know what would change this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2329.4s	2329.4	 Is if when we send 100,000 troops over there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2332.6s	2332.6	 it's a draft and it's not an all paid military.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2336.4s	2336.4	 The fact that these people in Washington
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2338.0s	2338.0	 who got their kids in Georgetown or Harvard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2339.7s	2339.7	 or wherever they are, Stanford,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2341.1s	2341.1	 don't have to send their kids over there to fight this war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2343.6s	2343.6	 is one of the reasons they can write these documents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2345.4s	2345.4	 and have these doctrines that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2346.3s	2346.3	 hey, you gotta send all these troops into harm's way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2349.4s	2349.4	 Like if they had to send their sons and daughters,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2351.3s	2351.3	 it would be a much different discussion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2353.2s	2353.2	 of like where we're gonna start a war,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2354.7s	2354.7	 whether it's Afghanistan or the Ukraine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2356.4s	2356.4	 All right, let's go to markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2358.4s	2358.4	 Bill Ackman came over the top.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2360.9s	2360.9	 He's buying a ton of Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2364.0s	2364.0	 And Tesla just absolutely flipped
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2367.9s	2367.9	 to becoming a money printing machine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2371.2s	2371.2	 and had a ridiculous quarter revenues up 53 to 53 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2375.8s	2375.8	 up 71% year over year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2378.2s	2378.2	 Q4 revenue, 17 billion, 65% year over year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2382.4s	2382.4	 And they increased their deliveries by 71%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2386.6s	2386.6	 And now you're all of a sudden to start to see some,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2390.6s	2390.6	 income coming into the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2392.1s	2392.1	 So flipping from money losing to break even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2394.8s	2394.8	 to now printing a ton of money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2396.9s	2396.9	 Microsoft had an absurd quarter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2399.8s	2399.8	 Their revenue hit 51.7 billion up 20% in the quarter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2404.9s	2404.9	 20% year over year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2407.2s	2407.2	 pays for $200 billion in revenue in 2022.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2410.2s	2410.2	 And their net income was also up 20 plus percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2414.0s	2414.0	 at 18.8 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2415.2s	2415.2	 So the money printing machine in these companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2417.9s	2417.9	 is just extraordinary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2418.8s	2418.8	 Chamath, what are your thoughts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2420.0s	2420.0	 I think you forgot a couple of key things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2422.5s	2422.5	 which is that the FOMC meeting happened this week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2425.4s	2425.4	 and Powell basically said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2426.6s	2426.6	 look, we're gonna start tightening in March.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2428.6s	2428.6	 I think the way that he said it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2430.0s	2430.0	 all of these words tend to be so scrutinized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2432.1s	2432.1	 and overanalyzed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2433.0s	2433.0	 but instead of figuring out what people thought,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2437.2s	2437.2	 I think their actions post the FOMC are important,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2440.3s	2440.3	 which is that we effectively now started to price in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2444.3s	2444.3	 about five rate hikes this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2446.3s	2446.3	 So probably 525 point rate hikes effectively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2449.4s	2449.4	 That's what the yield curve tells us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2452.7s	2452.7	 If you take a big step back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2455.9s	2455.9	 I just wanna remind people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2458.0s	2458.0	 it's really hard to live through volatility, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2461.4s	2461.4	 And we're in the phase of it now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2463.8s	2463.8	 but typically these big drawdowns are like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2466.5s	2466.5	 when stocks go down, it actually precedes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2469.8s	2469.8	 so it comes before the actual starting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2472.7s	2472.7	 of a rate hike cycle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2474.8s	2474.8	 And so if you go back to the,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2476.5s	2476.5	 from 1950 onwards today,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2479.6s	2479.6	 every time the government has started to raise rates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2483.1s	2483.1	 or the Federal Reserve has started to raise rates,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2485.0s	2485.0	 the stock markets have actually rallied.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2487.0s	2487.0	 Now, why is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2488.6s	2488.6	 It's typically that they see through the end
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2490.4s	2490.4	 of the rate hike cycle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2492.3s	2492.3	 and they start to price the business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2493.8s	2493.8	 as if these rate hikes are done and to rebase things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2497.2s	2497.2	 And on average, I think the stock markets go up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2499.1s	2499.1	 between seven and 8%,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2500.4s	2500.4	 so call it seven and a half, eight and a half percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2503.6s	2503.6	 And so what's interesting to me is now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2505.8s	2505.8	 we're finally starting the process of these hikes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2509.2s	2509.2	 and the real question is going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2511.1s	2511.1	 how data dependent do these guys get?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2513.5s	2513.5	 And what I mean by that is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2515.0s	2515.0	 so we talked about this before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2516.5s	2516.5	 but China cut rates,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2518.9s	2518.9	 this past weekend actually Germany decreased
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2521.5s	2521.5	 their GDP forecast,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2523.4s	2523.4	 and so you're starting to see two huge countries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2525.4s	2525.4	 already say, hey, wait a minute,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2526.7s	2526.7	 we need to be more realistic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2530.4s	2530.4	 about what long-term growth looks like here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2533.2s	2533.2	 It's inconceivable in my mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2534.8s	2534.8	 that those countries are slowing down and we won't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2537.8s	2537.8	 And so I think what happens in these other huge GDP drivers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2540.9s	2540.9	 of world GDP will affect us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2543.3s	2543.3	 And so, Saxon and I have said this before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2545.4s	2545.4	 but the marginal risk will be that we over-correct
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2548.4s	2548.4	 and actually create a recession that doesn't need to be one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2552.4s	2552.4	 We slam on the brakes too hard,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2553.8s	2553.8	 and another way of saying it is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2555.4s	2555.4	 the rate hikes are, the market is a leading indicator
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2558.6s	2558.6	 of what's gonna happen post the rate hikes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2561.4s	2561.4	 We had a nice relief rally going until,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2563.3s	2563.3	 I think some of the words that Paul used
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2564.6s	2564.6	 was that there was plenty of room for rate hikes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2567.8s	2567.8	 Meaning that because unemployment's at 3.5%,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2571.2s	2571.2	 that we're at full employment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2573.1s	2573.1	 and that means that the Fed has this dual mission
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2577.0s	2577.0	 of keeping inflation low and keeping employment high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2581.0s	2581.0	 So if employment is high,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2582.8s	2582.8	 then they've got more room to raise rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2585.0s	2585.0	 Anyway, it was that language around the plenty of room
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2587.4s	2587.4	 that freaked markets out and it triggered a huge sell-off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2590.4s	2590.4	 I think to Jamal's point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2591.7s	2591.7	 I don't see how you can have this much wealth destroyed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2597.0s	2597.0	 so quickly and have it not impact the real economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2600.4s	2600.4	 There's a lot of people out there who feel a lot poorer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2603.8s	2603.8	 because their portfolios have gotten slashed in value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2606.5s	2606.5	 I mean, anybody with-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2607.3s	2607.3	 So they'll belt tightening,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2608.2s	2608.2	 they'll clench, not spend as much money on a vacation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2610.8s	2610.8	 not buy a TV or a car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2612.6s	2612.6	 So these wait lists for cars might get, become sales.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2616.3s	2616.3	 The luxury markets of the economy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2618.5s	2618.5	 the optional purchases start to really slow down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2622.0s	2622.0	 And so I think that the risk of recession now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2624.9s	2624.9	 is much higher than it was even a month ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2627.7s	2627.7	 Now, it's gonna be hard to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2631.0s	2631.0	 So basically, I think what we're saying is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2632.8s	2632.8	 it's gonna be very hard for the Fed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2634.2s	2634.2	 to engineer a soft landing here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2635.9s	2635.9	 where we don't trigger a recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2640.0s	2640.0	 in the process of stopping inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2642.6s	2642.6	 And look, we'll judge Powell's performance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2646.9s	2646.9	 at the end of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2648.8s	2648.8	 We're not gonna know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2649.6s	2649.6	 I think it's, but I think that he's turned out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2652.2s	2652.2	 to be much more hawkish in his statements
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2655.0s	2655.0	 than markets were expecting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2656.5s	2656.5	 Again, and in 2018, he was probably overly hawkish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2660.2s	2660.2	 and he actually created effectively a little mini recession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2664.0s	2664.0	 We didn't pay attention enough to it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2666.1s	2666.1	 because Trump made it impossible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2668.1s	2668.1	 to see the signal from the noise, but it did happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2671.4s	2671.4	 And it was Powell being a little too trigger happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2674.2s	2674.2	 And so, we have to remember that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2677.4s	2677.4	 the Fed has $9 trillion of assets on their balance sheet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2681.2s	2681.2	 And so, if they start to take $9 trillion of cash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2685.2s	2685.2	 out of the system by selling these assets into the market,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2688.8s	2688.8	 you're taking the money out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2690.0s	2690.0	 because you're getting money back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2691.4s	2691.4	 that's gonna have an enormous huge impact as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2693.8s	2693.8	 So if you think about-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2694.6s	2694.6	 Stupid question, Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2695.5s	2695.5	 What happens when that money comes out?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2696.3s	2696.3	 One second, let me finish, please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2698.5s	2698.5	 So when you have these two things happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2701.2s	2701.2	 at the same time, you have a potential rate hike cycle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2703.9s	2703.9	 which makes the cost of a used car more expensive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2707.5s	2707.5	 the cost of your credit card balance is more expensive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2710.6s	2710.6	 the obligations you have to pay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2711.9s	2711.9	 just become naturally more expensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2713.3s	2713.3	 You feel poor, so you spend less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2715.4s	2715.4	 And then separately, in the financial markets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2717.1s	2717.1	 you actually take liquidity out of the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2719.9s	2719.9	 And so, people value liquidity more,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2723.4s	2723.4	 it becomes worth more, you value current cash more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2729.2s	2729.2	 I mean, we're putting ourselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2730.7s	2730.7	 in a really delicate position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2732.0s	2732.0	 So he's got a delicate balancing act here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2734.7s	2734.7	 he is definitely on a tightrope.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2736.2s	2736.2	 So if we pull nine trillion out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2737.9s	2737.9	 we've been talking about this deficit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2739.3s	2739.3	 if he starts selling all of those assets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2741.6s	2741.6	 does that mean on the United States balance sheet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2744.4s	2744.4	 that will reduce our national debt?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2747.5s	2747.5	 No, I mean, we're getting nine trillion of cash, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2751.1s	2751.1	 You sell an asset, you get cash for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2753.0s	2753.0	 Right, and so-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2753.8s	2753.8	 So it pulls money out of the economy in the same way that-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2756.0s	2756.0	 Pulls money out of the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2757.7s	2757.7	 It created liquidity when they were buying assets, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2761.6s	2761.6	 When they were buying this debt,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2763.1s	2763.1	 it would push money out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2764.8s	2764.8	 If they're selling the debt, it pulls money back in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2767.1s	2767.1	 What happens to those dollars is my point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2769.5s	2769.5	 like what is the impact of the dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2771.6s	2771.6	 sitting around in the United States bank account?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2773.8s	2773.8	 The dollar stays in the USA's bank account,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2776.6s	2776.6	 but the obligation, the note,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2778.0s	2778.0	 exists in some financial intermediary that holds it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2781.9s	2781.9	 Clearly Powell does not wanna be remembered
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2783.9s	2783.9	 as the Fed chief that let inflation slip the leash, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2788.1s	2788.1	 I mean, he's gotten religion now around the idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2792.5s	2792.5	 that this inflation is not transitory,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2794.5s	2794.5	 which was his position for months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2796.2s	2796.2	 I think that now bit him,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2797.8s	2797.8	 and the risk is potentially an over-correction,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2800.4s	2800.4	 but he's not gonna let inflation-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2801.9s	2801.9	 Then he'll be the first Fed governor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2803.3s	2803.3	 to have caused two recessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2806.3s	2806.3	 I think it's like a serious risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2808.0s	2808.0	 And by the way, these market levels that we're at right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2810.9s	2810.9	 I mean, look, 60% correction in gross stocks, okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2814.4s	2814.4	 But this is with, that's still in a good economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2817.7s	2817.7	 in peacetime conditions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2819.0s	2819.0	 And now we have a risk of recession and war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2822.8s	2822.8	 So, there's still room for a lot more negative news here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2828.5s	2828.5	 is kind of my point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2831.1s	2831.1	 But look, sentiment's also very negative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2832.8s	2832.8	 So when sentiment is this negative,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2835.1s	2835.1	 there's also the potential for markets to quickly recover
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2838.6s	2838.6	 if there's positive news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2839.7s	2839.7	 But the sentiment is there for the wrong reasons, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2842.0s	2842.0	 I don't think people are thinking recession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2843.6s	2843.6	 I think people are thinking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2844.5s	2844.5	 my gosh, these rate increases,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2846.2s	2846.2	 my gosh, I can't own these high-growth stocks anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2849.2s	2849.2	 And none of those things are true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2850.4s	2850.4	 Those are just perceptions that get amplified
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2852.8s	2852.8	 by one's emotions when you're getting punched in the face,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2855.0s	2855.0	 which is what happens when you wake up every day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2856.6s	2856.6	 in your portfolio and get five or 6%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2859.3s	2859.3	 It generates incredible opportunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2864.5s	2864.5	 The idea that markets bucket,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2867.5s	2867.5	 quote unquote, growth stocks together,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2870.3s	2870.3	 I think kind of obfuscates an important point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2874.1s	2874.1	 which is that some of the businesses in that category
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2876.9s	2876.9	 are real businesses that are gonna succeed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2879.0s	2879.0	 over the long run.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2880.2s	2880.2	 And some of them are speculative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2881.7s	2881.7	 and are likely to fail over the short run.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2884.6s	2884.6	 And as you saw Netflix sell off,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2887.7s	2887.7	 Bill Ackman, very smart,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2888.7s	2888.7	 came in and bought a bunch of the stock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2890.8s	2890.8	 I don't know if you guys remember this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2891.9s	2891.9	 but in 2011, TCV,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2894.6s	2894.6	 which is traditionally a private equity investor at the time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2896.9s	2896.9	 and there wasn't a lot of crossover
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2898.1s	2898.1	 and public market stuff happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2899.7s	2899.7	 J-Hope?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2900.7s	2900.7	 They were a private investor in Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2905.0s	2905.0	 Netflix stock tanked from,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2906.6s	2906.6	 I think it was around $220 a share
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2909.3s	2909.3	 down to 70 bucks a share in a couple of months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2912.0s	2912.0	 And TCV did a $200 million pipe into Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2915.2s	2915.2	 And everyone was like, oh my God, what are they doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2917.0s	2917.0	 It's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2918.2s	2918.2	 And by the way, that was on an adjusted basis,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2920.5s	2920.5	 that's $10 a share in today's share price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2923.1s	2923.1	 So that $200 million investment that they made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2926.5s	2926.5	 went up 60X at the peak of Netflix a few weeks ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2932.0s	2932.0	 And so seeing Bill Ackman come in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2934.9s	2934.9	 and underwrite Netflix again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2935.7s	2935.7	 and make a big investment at its current market price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2938.5s	2938.5	 So J-Hope?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2940.0s	2940.0	 I think it just really highlights that there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2942.1s	2942.1	 just because the market price is down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2944.3s	2944.3	 doesn't mean that a business isn't fundamentally valuable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2947.1s	2947.1	 and gonna grow and gonna generate significant returns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2949.4s	2949.4	 over time as an operating business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2952.4s	2952.4	 And that distinction starts to present
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2954.7s	2954.7	 significant opportunities in a market condition like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2957.5s	2957.5	 And the businesses, we all talk about generally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2959.7s	2959.7	 growth stocks are down 60%,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2961.0s	2961.0	 but maybe most of them shouldn't have even been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2962.5s	2962.5	 public companies in the first place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2964.0s	2964.0	 Maybe they should have been speculative private investments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2966.8s	2966.8	 where more than two thirds of them were likely to fail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2968.9s	2968.9	 and they shouldn't be failing as public companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2970.9s	2970.9	 And the few that are getting damaged and hit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2973.3s	2973.3	 with this market sentiment shift can be picked up cheap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2976.8s	2976.8	 And there's a lot of opportunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2978.0s	2978.0	 And so I wouldn't view the market condition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2979.7s	2979.7	 to be necessarily reflective again of the economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2982.3s	2982.3	 or the condition of businesses in general.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2984.0s	2984.0	 J-Hope was a partner at TCV.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2985.5s	2985.5	 He's a founder of TCV that did that deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2987.1s	2987.1	 And he's also the one that participated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2989.5s	2989.5	 and led the billion dollar round into Peloton
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2993.8s	2993.8	 before they whiffed earnings and got decapitated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2998.6s	2998.6	 But he's an incredible investor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=2999.9s	2999.9	 That trade is probably one of the best trades of all time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3002.6s	3002.6	 So let's look in the good news column.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3005.5s	3005.5	 Wages way up, earnings way up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3009.8s	3009.8	 10 million job openings in the United States,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3012.9s	3012.9	 pretty close to record low unemployment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3015.6s	3015.6	 and the pandemic ending and people having record savings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3019.0s	3019.0	 in their bank accounts and personal balance sheets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3021.4s	3021.4	 So how does all that good news?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3023.0s	3023.0	 The pandemic hasn't ended.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3024.5s	3024.5	 It's ending for people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3025.7s	3025.7	 I think it's over for people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3027.4s	3027.4	 I'll tell you the thing I'm most concerned about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3028.9s	3028.9	 There's a reverberation that persists in supply chains.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3033.1s	3033.1	 I don't know how much hardware, lab, biotech,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3037.4s	3037.4	 consumer goods businesses you guys are involved in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3039.8s	3039.8	 I'm involved in a number of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3041.6s	3041.6	 Every single one of them are crippled in some way right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3044.0s	3044.0	 by supply chain issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3045.0s	3045.0	 I mean, I'm talking about like businesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3047.2s	3047.2	 that have been operating at steady state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3048.9s	3048.9	 for many, many years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3050.0s	3050.0	 When do those get worked out?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3051.9s	3051.9	 We don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3052.8s	3052.8	 And everyone's getting surprised
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3053.9s	3053.9	 and hit upside the head every week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3055.3s	3055.3	 with some new supply chain shortage,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3057.5s	3057.5	 whether it's some chemical you need for some lab equipment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3060.2s	3060.2	 or the delivery of some big piece of equipment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3063.2s	3063.2	 or even plastic bottles that we use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3065.0s	3065.0	 that kind of fill up our beverages that we ship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3068.5s	3068.5	 That's a pretty sizable business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3070.1s	3070.1	 We've never had supply chain disruption
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3071.9s	3071.9	 like we're seeing right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3072.7s	3072.7	 I'd like to bleep out the name of that company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3074.3s	3074.3	 Yeah, beep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3075.5s	3075.5	 But it's like, it's a bleep this out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3077.9s	3077.9	 But it's a significantly sized business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3080.0s	3080.0	 that has never had supply chain issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3082.3s	3082.3	 It's all US based.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3083.7s	3083.7	 But some of the suppliers of the suppliers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3086.4s	3086.4	 have had complete failure in delivery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3088.9s	3088.9	 And all of a sudden it's now reverberating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3090.4s	3090.4	 through the supply chain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3091.2s	3091.2	 You guys saw that GM didn't deliver
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3092.9s	3092.9	 a single frigging electric vehicle last quarter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3095.2s	3095.2	 because they couldn't actually get the chips
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3096.9s	3096.9	 that they needed to make cars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3098.5s	3098.5	 So the real risk to the economy, in my opinion right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3102.1s	3102.1	 is when and how we're gonna work our way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3103.7s	3103.7	 through the supply chain issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3104.9s	3104.9	 And it is so complex and there's a myriad of problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3107.6s	3107.6	 And it is a global problem that it's really unclear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3110.5s	3110.5	 how this is gonna play out over the next six months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3112.6s	3112.6	 And what'll happen is this quarter, next quarter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3115.4s	3115.4	 businesses that you didn't realize and didn't expect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3117.5s	3117.5	 are gonna get hit with supply chain problems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3119.3s	3119.3	 are suddenly gonna say, guess what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3120.9s	3120.9	 Our revenue's off by 20, 30%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3123.0s	3123.0	 because we couldn't sell this product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3125.0s	3125.0	 because half our shelves are empty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3126.7s	3126.7	 because product didn't show up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3127.8s	3127.8	 or whatever the narrative might be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3129.7s	3129.7	 All right, so it's a real problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3131.5s	3131.5	 I think it's a really, I think it's a great point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3133.3s	3133.3	 because you don't solve these supply chain issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3136.9s	3136.9	 with rate hikes, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3138.8s	3138.8	 It's like-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3139.7s	3139.7	 It has nothing to do with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3140.5s	3140.5	 Nothing to do with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3141.3s	3141.3	 So the rate hikes slow the economy down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3142.2s	3142.2	 And that's why I'm way more worried
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3143.7s	3143.7	 about this than rate hikes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3145.6s	3145.6	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3146.5s	3146.5	 What does clean it up is capitalism,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3149.2s	3149.2	 the end of the pandemic, time, indigestion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3152.7s	3152.7	 And the reason I'm less worried
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3153.9s	3153.9	 is when you actually talk to the companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3155.7s	3155.7	 that are spending enormous amounts of money on CapEx,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3159.0s	3159.0	 they've actually guided to the fact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3160.4s	3160.4	 that by the end of this year and the beginning of next year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3162.5s	3162.5	 most of these things will be worked out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3163.9s	3163.9	 It's indigestion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3164.8s	3164.8	 So I think we're dealing with a six to nine month issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3168.5s	3168.5	 of having turned things off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3170.9s	3170.9	 and now are now rapidly trying to turn things back on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3173.8s	3173.8	 And we can't necessarily get that timing right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3176.7s	3176.7	 But I do think it'll work itself out faster
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3178.5s	3178.5	 than people expect personally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3180.0s	3180.0	 That's what I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3180.8s	3180.8	 Because the cost of Apple and Tesla
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3182.4s	3182.4	 specifically guiding to that is too enormous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3185.2s	3185.2	 You're talking about collectively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3186.8s	3186.8	 almost 4 trillion of market cap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3188.3s	3188.3	 So they're not gonna get something like this wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3190.5s	3190.5	 And they were pretty clear in the last few days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3192.7s	3192.7	 that this will be done by 2023, early 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3196.5s	3196.5	 So, Sachs Orchardmoth, I just listed all the good news
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3199.3s	3199.3	 to counter the slog and the bad news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3203.9s	3203.9	 How do you account for record low unemployment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3206.7s	3206.7	 record number of jobs, record wages going up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3209.7s	3209.7	 massive cash on people's personal balance sheet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3212.1s	3212.1	 massive amounts of sideline cash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3215.0s	3215.0	 massive amounts of venture funds being raised
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3217.0s	3217.0	 that have to be deployed in the next five years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3219.6s	3219.6	 All that good news, where does that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3221.5s	3221.5	 on this balance sheet of good versus bad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3224.1s	3224.1	 work out for you, Sachs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3225.4s	3225.4	 Well, the negatives are that, yes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3227.5s	3227.5	 the unemployment rate is very low,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3228.9s	3228.9	 but a lot of people have dropped out of the labor force.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3232.9s	3232.9	 So the labor participation rate is still quite low.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3235.7s	3235.7	 Because of?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3236.7s	3236.7	 Well, because I think a lot of people dropped out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3239.3s	3239.3	 because of COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3240.6s	3240.6	 Everyone went remote and I think they got these STEMI checks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3244.8s	3244.8	 and I think a lot of people got used to not working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3248.6s	3248.6	 Maybe you had a household with two people used to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3252.0s	3252.0	 and now only one of them's working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3253.9s	3253.9	 Maybe they moved to a cheaper part of the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3256.3s	3256.3	 So, I mean, maybe it's a good thing, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3258.1s	3258.1	 But a lot of people dropped out of the labor force
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3262.1s	3262.1	 and they haven't come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3263.8s	3263.8	 And so that's the negative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3265.0s	3265.0	 And then, the fact that wages are going up is good,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3267.6s	3267.6	 but we don't know how much that's inflation, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3269.8s	3269.8	 So, those would be the negatives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3273.7s	3273.7	 But there was a report that inventory levels did rise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3278.3s	3278.3	 in Q4.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3279.5s	3279.5	 And so the supply chain issues do seem to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3282.9s	3282.9	 ameliorating to some degree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3284.2s	3284.2	 Anecdotally, I was looking at cars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3285.9s	3285.9	 and now a lot of the people who had,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3289.3s	3289.3	 there's no way to get this car now, they're like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3291.1s	3291.1	 hey, we got a couple of these cars available
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3293.4s	3293.4	 if you want them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3294.5s	3294.5	 And then if you look at the housing inventory,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3296.5s	3296.5	 it does seem that maybe that's taking a plus two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3299.0s	3299.0	 and people couldn't find houses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3300.3s	3300.3	 And now maybe even though it's still a housing crisis,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3302.7s	3302.7	 maybe there's more available
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3303.7s	3303.7	 or they're staying on the market a little bit longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3305.5s	3305.5	 Yeah, I mean, I think it's pretty clear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3307.0s	3307.0	 that economic activity is slowing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3308.6s	3308.6	 And again, things like rate increases,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3311.1s	3311.1	 it increases the cost of a mortgage, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3314.8s	3314.8	 So, that could affect house prices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3318.5s	3318.5	 I think there's an interesting startup story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3321.8s	3321.8	 There's a private company that's doing essentially life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3325.3s	3325.3	 extension that a bunch of rich people put $3 billion into.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3329.0s	3329.0	 You wanna tell us, Friedberg, in your science segment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3332.1s	3332.1	 what is this gonna make us live longer or not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3334.4s	3334.4	 Well, I think I mentioned this company a few episodes ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3341.3s	3341.3	 but I think they just announced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3343.7s	3343.7	 their $3 billion investment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3348.2s	3348.2	 And again, this goes back to the point I made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3352.1s	3352.1	 on the prediction show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3353.3s	3353.3	 So last week, Altos Labs announced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3355.2s	3355.2	 that they've landed $3 billion in funding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3357.6s	3357.6	 And this has been an ongoing funding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3359.6s	3359.6	 that's been going on for quite a while into this business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3363.5s	3363.5	 But this business was set up to commercialize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3367.3s	3367.3	 Yamanaka factor-based cellular reprogramming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3370.1s	3370.1	 for age reversal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3372.6s	3372.6	 And there was a paper published just yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3376.2s	3376.2	 I'll put a link in the show notes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3377.6s	3377.6	 that if people are interested in reading a scientific paper,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3379.9s	3379.9	 they can take a look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3380.9s	3380.9	 Incredible results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3383.1s	3383.1	 Scientists took mice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3384.9s	3384.9	 gave those mice short bursts of these Yamanaka factors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3388.1s	3388.1	 and then measured all the biomarkers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3390.0s	3390.0	 all of the chemical signatures in the blood of those mice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3392.6s	3392.6	 to determine their age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3394.0s	3394.0	 Because there are known ways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3395.1s	3395.1	 that we can measure the age of an organism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3396.8s	3396.8	 by looking in their blood at measuring certain biomarkers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3399.6s	3399.6	 And with just a few short bursts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3401.2s	3401.2	 for about a week of these drugs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3404.3s	3404.3	 these Yamanaka factors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3406.0s	3406.0	 the mice, all of their age signals reversed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3408.5s	3408.5	 to making it look like they were very young again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3410.9s	3410.9	 And it did not do what the challenge has been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3413.2s	3413.2	 with Yamanaka factors in the past,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3414.7s	3414.7	 is if you put too much of it in a body, in an organism,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3418.3s	3418.3	 the cells rejuvenate to becoming stem cells,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3421.1s	3421.1	 which is kind of like what a fetus might have,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3423.4s	3423.4	 and starts to grow a lot of tumors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3425.4s	3425.4	 They were able to avoid having tumors show up in the mice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3428.5s	3428.5	 and the mice, in fact, all looked extremely young
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3431.4s	3431.4	 from a biomarker basis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3432.5s	3432.5	 So an incredible result, an incredible paper,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3435.2s	3435.2	 whether or not it gets repeated and shown by others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3438.0s	3438.0	 But I think this speaks to the quality of the science
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3440.7s	3440.7	 that's underlying the $3 billion investment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3442.9s	3442.9	 that was just made in Altos Labs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3444.1s	3444.1	 which is probably one of the biggest seed investments ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3446.9s	3446.9	 No, it clearly is the biggest seed investment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3449.2s	3449.2	 ever in a start-up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3450.0s	3450.0	 I think it speaks to what I highlighted,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3451.9s	3451.9	 what will be the new frontier in biotech,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3454.1s	3454.1	 and will completely rewrite the course of humanity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3457.7s	3457.7	 is if we can take drugs and for a short period of time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3460.1s	3460.1	 completely reverse the age of ourselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3461.8s	3461.8	 And it sounds so crazy and so wacky,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3464.0s	3464.0	 but it's being now proven in a single week,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3466.3s	3466.3	 we've now had an amazing paper published,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3468.3s	3468.3	 and we've seen the start-up announce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3469.7s	3469.7	 their $3 billion of funding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3470.9s	3470.9	 to pursue commercialization of this technology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3473.1s	3473.1	 And this is gonna be the year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3474.0s	3474.0	 I think this will be the front cover
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3475.1s	3475.1	 of a lot of magazines this year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3476.8s	3476.8	 as people realize that this is real,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3479.5s	3479.5	 and that it's getting commercialized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3481.1s	3481.1	 So we're really excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3482.5s	3482.5	 Why do you think they have to start with $3 billion?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3486.3s	3486.3	 And I'll tell you why I asked the question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3488.9s	3488.9	 Whenever I see these grandiose prognostications
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3492.2s	3492.2	 of future progress and then see these companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3494.5s	3494.5	 raise exorbitant amounts of money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3496.7s	3496.7	 I have never found a single example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3499.3s	3499.3	 where it's ever worked, ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3500.9s	3500.9	 In fact, every time I see a company raise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3503.3s	3503.3	 an exorbitant amount of money in a Series A,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3505.3s	3505.3	 I write them off in my head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3506.8s	3506.8	 Yeah, sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3508.5s	3508.5	 So why should I not in this case?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3510.5s	3510.5	 So-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3511.6s	3511.6	 Or actually, a better question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3513.6s	3513.6	 Why would somebody listening to this pod go work there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3516.0s	3516.0	 And take the Series A equity?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3517.5s	3517.5	 By the way, the same has been done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3519.4s	3519.4	 and can be said about Calico,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3520.9s	3520.9	 which is alphabet subsidiary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3522.4s	3522.4	 that's pursuing similar research,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3524.5s	3524.5	 where billions of dollars have gone into that business,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3526.8s	3526.8	 and there's a similar sort of research track underway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3530.2s	3530.2	 And I think the general principle, Chamath,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3531.8s	3531.8	 is they don't know what the product is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3533.7s	3533.7	 they don't know the way to market,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3535.3s	3535.3	 they don't know what area they need to explore,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3538.7s	3538.7	 but the underlying principle is proven,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3540.9s	3540.9	 the underlying principle is something that people believe in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3543.4s	3543.4	 This science is proven, this science is real,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3545.9s	3545.9	 we don't know the commercial path
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3547.3s	3547.3	 and we have to try lots of different things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3548.8s	3548.8	 and run lots of different research programs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3550.7s	3550.7	 in parallel to figure it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3552.3s	3552.3	 And each of those research programs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3553.8s	3553.8	 is like a hundred million dollar biotech startup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3556.1s	3556.1	 And so I think that the principle is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3558.2s	3558.2	 let's put a lot of shots on goal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3560.5s	3560.5	 all at once in parallel and make sure,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3562.5s	3562.5	 because if any of these shots on goal work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3564.6s	3564.6	 this is gonna be worth many, many billions of dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3566.9s	3566.9	 So I think that's generally the idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3568.2s	3568.2	 It's almost like having a $3 billion venture fund,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3570.5s	3570.5	 but the venture fund is targeted at one core area of interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3574.2s	3574.2	 that we believe is real.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3576.1s	3576.1	 And I think that's the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3576.9s	3576.9	 a lot of these things are being set up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3578.0s	3578.0	 But I'm asking this question,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3579.2s	3579.2	 have you ever seen a company try to do 30 different things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3581.9s	3581.9	 and it works?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3583.0s	3583.0	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3583.9s	3583.9	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3584.8s	3584.8	 Yeah, I mean, it's not the typical capital allocation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3587.1s	3587.1	 milestone based funding scheme,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3589.3s	3589.3	 I have a theory about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3590.2s	3590.2	 But it's not a product market fit thing, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3591.9s	3591.9	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3592.7s	3592.7	 It's a research program
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3594.1s	3594.1	 and it's a series of research programs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3596.1s	3596.1	 But I mean, look, let me reframe it for you, Chimot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3598.9s	3598.9	 Have you ever seen a $3 billion venture fund
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3601.7s	3601.7	 that makes 100 bets with smart people at the helm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3604.7s	3604.7	 with smart people working at the individual businesses fail?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3608.1s	3608.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3608.9s	3608.9	 And in fact, I've never seen a $3 billion venture fund
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3611.0s	3611.0	 do much more than return 2X of money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3613.6s	3613.6	 Yeah. Well, look, let's see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3614.8s	3614.8	 I mean, it's a big bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3616.2s	3616.2	 And obviously there's some people making nice management fees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3618.6s	3618.6	 and nice carry on this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3619.6s	3619.6	 I'm not trying to be a wet blanket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3620.7s	3620.7	 I'm just curious, why do it that way?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3623.3s	3623.3	 Meaning, you know, every startup...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3625.7s	3625.7	 Let's get Bob Nelson on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3626.8s	3626.8	 He'll talk about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3627.7s	3627.7	 Yeah, so he set it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3629.2s	3629.2	 Every startup, I think, is forced in some ways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3632.4s	3632.4	 by the market to make an educated guess
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3635.6s	3635.6	 about where product market fit lies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3637.3s	3637.3	 and to try to build some minimum viable product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3639.3s	3639.3	 That tends to be how value is created.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3641.9s	3641.9	 I mean, you could have said that, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3643.7s	3643.7	 Google could have had 90 different algorithms,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3646.3s	3646.3	 but you know, Larry Page started with Backroom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3648.2s	3648.2	 That's how it started.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3649.1s	3649.1	 He had to make an educated guess that...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3651.8s	3651.8	 He had to make decisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3652.9s	3652.9	 And that's what startups about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3654.5s	3654.5	 You have to make decisions and you have to...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3656.1s	3656.1	 Well, you have to make a bet on your own intellectual veracity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3659.3s	3659.3	 Why don't you put all your capital into one company?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3661.2s	3661.2	 Oh, because mostly the companies won't let me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3663.4s	3663.4	 but I would if I could.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3664.3s	3664.3	 Oh, interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3665.1s	3665.1	 So I think that what's happening here to be...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3667.5s	3667.5	 I mean, you're absolutely right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3668.8s	3668.8	 If I could, I would, but they don't let me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3671.0s	3671.0	 You could put all your money back into Facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3673.0s	3673.0	 or back into...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3673.8s	3673.8	 Forget Facebook, I know you got issues,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3674.7s	3674.7	 but what about Alphabet or Amazon?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3676.1s	3676.1	 Just put all your capital in one bet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3677.4s	3677.4	 and just, you know, write it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3679.4s	3679.4	 Right, but then it comes to what I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3681.0s	3681.0	 where I can generate the best return.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3683.5s	3683.5	 Meaning, you know, I think that I could generate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3685.1s	3685.1	 much higher returns than what I think Google will give me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3688.3s	3688.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3689.1s	3689.1	 That's why I do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3689.9s	3689.9	 Well, here's what I think is happening here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3691.6s	3691.6	 There are a lot of rich people who are going to die soon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3695.3s	3695.3	 and they're counting down like Bezos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3698.0s	3698.0	 And they're saying, why not, if I'm worth 100 billion,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3701.5s	3701.5	 put one, two, three billion into this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3704.0s	3704.0	 and have them go for it because I've got nothing to lose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3707.0s	3707.0	 because I'm dying in 20 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3708.9s	3708.9	 This is a fear of death by billionaire bet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3711.9s	3711.9	 which is exactly what I think happened with the Google guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3714.6s	3714.6	 They were just like...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3715.4s	3715.4	 I'll also say, the team involved in these projects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3717.6s	3717.6	 are not first time founders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3719.5s	3719.5	 or people that are great pitch men.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3721.2s	3721.2	 It's people that are repeated, tried and true,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3723.4s	3723.4	 entrepreneur success stories
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3724.9s	3724.9	 that have done this over and over in biotech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3726.6s	3726.6	 And they're the ones that are being drawn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3727.6s	3727.6	 into working on these projects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3729.3s	3729.3	 And they're saying, look, because we've got the people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3731.0s	3731.0	 that have done it over and over, give them the capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3733.1s	3733.1	 I mean, do you think that's a good argument, Chamath?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3734.7s	3734.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3735.5s	3735.5	 No, I believe in Yamanaka factors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3737.1s	3737.1	 and I believe that there will be innovation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3739.4s	3739.4	 My only question is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3740.7s	3740.7	 is the innovation going to come through a small team
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3744.2s	3744.2	 that raises a small quantum of capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3746.1s	3746.1	 with one very focused idea that gets it right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3749.0s	3749.0	 Or this sort of, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3750.6s	3750.6	 Monte Carlo simulation approach to product innovation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3753.4s	3753.4	 And all I'm saying is just an observation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3756.0s	3756.0	 that historically it's been very difficult
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3758.9s	3758.9	 for these Monte Carlo simulations to ever work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3761.3s	3761.3	 either to generate product market fit and an innovation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3764.9s	3764.9	 and to make money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3766.1s	3766.1	 Now, hopefully these guys are the exception
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3767.8s	3767.8	 that proves the rule
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3768.7s	3768.7	 because I think we'd all want this to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3770.3s	3770.3	 No, it's a great point and I hope you're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3772.5s	3772.5	 And I hope to start that small project and wipe it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3775.9s	3775.9	 But that's a great point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3777.4s	3777.4	 Now you're saying the key thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3778.4s	3778.4	 because despite the $3 billion,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3780.1s	3780.1	 you're still gonna go after it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3781.2s	3781.2	 which implicitly is your way of saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3783.5s	3783.5	 I'm short that company and I'm long my own company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3786.0s	3786.0	 And this is the point I was trying to get to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3788.3s	3788.3	 which is when really, really smart people see these things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3792.4s	3792.4	 they tend to look at it with a grain of salt thinking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3794.9s	3794.9	 it's very difficult to build a startup as it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3797.4s	3797.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3798.3s	3798.3	 Sometimes it's kind of like growing great wine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3801.3s	3801.3	 You need to have a little pain and suffering along the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3805.1s	3805.1	 And when you have $3 billion,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3806.7s	3806.7	 it's the opposite of pain and suffering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3807.9s	3807.9	 Totally true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3808.7s	3808.7	 And I'll also say, let me just support your point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3811.5s	3811.5	 which is the people I see get hired to big projects like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3814.4s	3814.4	 and there are a number of them that get funded,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3819.2s	3819.2	 They hire the tried and true experienced executives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3822.2s	3822.2	 who generally have older kids and live in a nice house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3825.3s	3825.3	 and have made a bunch of money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3826.9s	3826.9	 And the earnestness, the motivation, the hunger,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3830.7s	3830.7	 the fuel, the creativity, because they know what they know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3833.9s	3833.9	 and they're not willing to accept that they don't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3835.5s	3835.5	 what they don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3836.9s	3836.9	 Those folks generally are less likely to succeed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3840.1s	3840.1	 than the folks who are doing this maybe for the first time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3843.1s	3843.1	 for that very reason, when you're doing something innovative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3845.1s	3845.1	 So I totally support your point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3846.6s	3846.6	 and I really do hope you're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3848.9s	3848.9	 But I thought, Jason, when you were talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3850.7s	3850.7	 talking about startups, I thought we were gonna talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3852.3s	3852.3	 Bolt and the Stripe Mafia fiasco this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3854.8s	3854.8	 Well, yeah, that's a good story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3856.3s	3856.3	 It's a pretty crazy story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3859.1s	3859.1	 Where does everyone fall?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3860.1s	3860.1	 What side does everyone fall on that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3861.8s	3861.8	 I'll go on the record.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3862.7s	3862.7	 Does anybody have any equity positions in either company?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3864.4s	3864.4	 Let's start there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3865.3s	3865.3	 No. No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3866.2s	3866.2	 Stripe holders, sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3868.0s	3868.0	 Sack, are you an LP in any firms that have exposure?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3872.2s	3872.2	 I'm an LP in funds that have exposure to it, absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3874.9s	3874.9	 Yeah, for sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3875.7s	3875.7	 I'm an LP in a fund that has exposure to it as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3877.8s	3877.8	 I am as well, but it doesn't-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3878.9s	3878.9	 It's minuscule, that doesn't affect-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3880.3s	3880.3	 Minuscule, doesn't matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3881.4s	3881.4	 Minuscule for me too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3882.3s	3882.3	 Okay, here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3883.1s	3883.1	 So for people who don't know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3884.8s	3884.8	 Bolt is like one-click checkout software.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3887.1s	3887.1	 They compete in some ways with Stripe's payment API.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3890.4s	3890.4	 The CEO, Ryan Breslau, did a tweet thread
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3894.2s	3894.2	 basically saying that YC and Stripe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3896.4s	3896.4	 are the mob bosses of Silicon Valley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3898.8s	3898.8	 It was pretty charged.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3901.1s	3901.1	 Obviously, Stripe and YC work together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3904.7s	3904.7	 Stripe is the biggest company to come out of YC ever,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3907.0s	3907.0	 I guess, along with Airbnb.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3909.6s	3909.6	 He claims that a lot of the top VCs were blocked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3912.9s	3912.9	 as a strategy by Stripe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3914.7s	3914.7	 And I think there is some truth to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3916.9s	3916.9	 When you invest in one company,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3918.1s	3918.1	 you don't invest in the competitor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3921.5s	3921.5	 I don't know if that happened here as a strategy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3922.9s	3922.9	 but it is a viable strategy that other people have used
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3925.1s	3925.1	 where Bolt claims Stripe got all the top investors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3929.9s	3929.9	 therefore they couldn't raise money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3932.0s	3932.0	 He also was saying they were voting things up and down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3934.2s	3934.2	 on Y Combinator's hacker news as if that matters,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3937.6s	3937.6	 yada, yada, yada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3938.6s	3938.6	 It was kind of a weak argument in my view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3943.2s	3943.2	 I'll give you my hot take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3944.1s	3944.1	 It resulted in a bunch of VCs dunking on him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3946.8s	3946.8	 I'll give you my hot take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3947.6s	3947.6	 So first of all, Bolt is now a $14 billion company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3950.1s	3950.1	 or something, okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3951.0s	3951.0	 So these guys, I think this was a very brilliant PR strategy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3956.7s	3956.7	 and it worked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3958.3s	3958.3	 What do I mean by this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3960.0s	3960.0	 This was a company that most people didn't know about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3962.1s	3962.1	 until this past week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3963.8s	3963.8	 They went and they punched up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3965.3s	3965.3	 which is a pretty tried and true PR strategy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3967.3s	3967.3	 Always fight up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3969.0s	3969.0	 You pick the big guy who's an incredibly pristine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3972.5s	3972.5	 extremely well-run company that is sucking up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3975.0s	3975.0	 most of the talented people in Silicon Valley to work for,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3978.7s	3978.7	 is a centacorn, could be a trillion dollar company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3983.0s	3983.0	 over some lifetime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3983.8s	3983.8	 So they went and they punched up and what happened?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3987.6s	3987.6	 Everybody fell for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3989.5s	3989.5	 They baited all of these folks and then all of these folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3992.2s	3992.2	 had to come out on Twitter and lambast them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3994.7s	3994.7	 And basically the net result of it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3996.7s	3996.7	 if one person knew about Bolt before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=3999.1s	3999.1	 now hundreds and thousands of people know about Bolt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4001.5s	4001.5	 afterwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4002.3s	4002.3	 So not only do they not know them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4004.2s	4004.2	 now they're contemporary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4005.5s	4005.5	 Just in terms of the practical reality,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4007.5s	4007.5	 they are now part of a discussion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4010.1s	4010.1	 and in a framework of companies in this space
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4013.1s	4013.1	 that they were never a part of before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4014.5s	4014.5	 This is Steve Jobs' move with the 1984 commercial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4018.1s	4018.1	 He said, IBM and then Microsoft, our big brother,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4021.1s	4021.1	 we're gonna attack them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4021.9s	4021.9	 join the rebel Alliance, be part of Apple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4024.0s	4024.0	 And of course, Apple and IBM responded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4026.6s	4026.6	 and that was the big mistake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4028.3s	4028.3	 Mark Andreessen, Sequoia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4030.0s	4030.0	 a bunch of different venture firms responded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4032.2s	4032.2	 Sax, what's your take on this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4034.6s	4034.6	 I see you're chomping at the bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4035.9s	4035.9	 or maybe you're biting your tongue, which is it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4037.7s	4037.7	 No, so I agree with Jamoth that it was kind of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4041.2s	4041.2	 brilliant PR move if that's what it was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4043.3s	4043.3	 I do like Starbucks punching up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4045.5s	4045.5	 and he took a punch at Stripe,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4047.1s	4047.1	 which is the big company in the space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4048.9s	4048.9	 So, and then yeah, Stripe didn't respond directly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4052.7s	4052.7	 The Colson's didn't respond, but their surrogates did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4055.4s	4055.4	 And then that looks like punching down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4056.9s	4056.9	 and it draws more attention to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4058.9s	4058.9	 So I get the PR strategy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4060.2s	4060.2	 I would say that as to the merits of the allegation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4064.7s	4064.7	 it's interesting that he didn't get into YC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4067.3s	4067.3	 because I think that he is a very talented founder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4070.4s	4070.4	 And we looked at this company pretty early on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4075.8s	4075.8	 It was for like sort of a mid-stage growth round.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4079.0s	4079.0	 And it was like one of the toughest decisions we face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4082.6s	4082.6	 I'd say the toughest decisions as a VC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4086.0s	4086.0	 is when you actually want to invest in the company,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4087.9s	4087.9	 but the valuation is like 2X what you think it should be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4091.9s	4091.9	 And that was kind of the situation at the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4094.6s	4094.6	 when we looked at it is I think we actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4097.0s	4097.0	 would have invested, this is the valuation was too high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4099.7s	4099.7	 So-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4100.6s	4100.6	 And it would have been a great bet for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4101.4s	4101.4	 Yeah, he grew into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4102.9s	4102.9	 And so it would have been a great bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4104.2s	4104.2	 So it was a bad decision on your part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4106.4s	4106.4	 Yeah, yeah, clearly we should have invested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4108.8s	4108.8	 It's just that, you know, at the time you invest,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4111.4s	4111.4	 you have to have some basis for valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4115.1s	4115.1	 And that's the sense in which I think, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4116.8s	4116.8	 maybe Ryan's accusations don't totally make sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4121.2s	4121.2	 is that he's been able to raise a lot of rounds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4124.0s	4124.0	 at really high valuations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4126.1s	4126.1	 And so he hasn't had a problem, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4129.5s	4129.5	 raising a lot of money at, you know, great prices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4132.5s	4132.5	 And, you know, it almost feels like a slap in the face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4135.5s	4135.5	 to his investors where like, what's the complaint?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4137.9s	4137.9	 I didn't get any tier one investors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4139.6s	4139.6	 Or that it was just hard to meet with investors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4141.9s	4141.9	 and that Stripe called the investors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4143.9s	4143.9	 and told them not to invest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4145.3s	4145.3	 That was the allegation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4147.9s	4147.9	 Yeah, no, I mean, yeah, I can't really speak to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4151.6s	4151.6	 But I mean, he was clearly able to raise great rounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4154.9s	4154.9	 Can I read to you an email exchange
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4157.1s	4157.1	 between me and Ryan Breslow?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4159.4s	4159.4	 Oh, dramatic reading.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4160.5s	4160.5	 From 2015.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4161.8s	4161.8	 Oh, here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4163.2s	4163.2	 H Moth hopes all as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4165.7s	4165.7	 FYI, things felt too rushed on our end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4167.7s	4167.7	 So we're toning down our series eight discussions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4169.5s	4169.5	 for a couple of months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4171.7s	4171.7	 And this was in July of 2015.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4174.5s	4174.5	 I'm reading you my answer because it's so fabulous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4177.7s	4177.7	 Hi, Ryan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4178.9s	4178.9	 After a wholly unsuccessful few weeks of attempting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4181.7s	4181.7	 to win a World Series of Poker Bracelet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4183.5s	4183.5	 I'm back at home licking my moons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4186.9s	4186.9	 How about we talk in a week or two?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4188.9s	4188.9	 So not only did I have a chance to win a World Series
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4191.8s	4191.8	 of Poker Bracelet according to this exchange,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4193.6s	4193.6	 which I didn't win, obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4195.1s	4195.1	 Duh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4195.9s	4195.9	 I had a chance to do the series A
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4197.3s	4197.3	 in a $14 billion company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4198.8s	4198.8	 Big company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4199.8s	4199.8	 Screwed that one up too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4201.2s	4201.2	 Big dummies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4202.5s	4202.5	 I mean, the things we miss are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4204.5s	4204.5	 there's like 20 things you miss as an investor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4206.8s	4206.8	 for everything you hit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4207.9s	4207.9	 So I've interacted with Ryan back in the day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4210.7s	4210.7	 and I just remember him being super, super smart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4212.7s	4212.7	 And I do think that, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4214.5s	4214.5	 there's a lot of very smart people now around the table
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4217.3s	4217.3	 at Bolt, including Joanne Bradford.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4219.6s	4219.6	 So I don't think that this was something that wasn't planned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4222.5s	4222.5	 And I just think that they executed it well and it worked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4225.1s	4225.1	 And I think a lot of people know this company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4226.7s	4226.7	 that didn't know it before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4227.9s	4227.9	 Now they still have to execute and build a product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4230.0s	4230.0	 and scale it and do all of these things, but.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4233.4s	4233.4	 Yeah, and I think that the response he provoked,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4235.5s	4235.5	 I mean, since I was a little bit critical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4237.9s	4237.9	 of what he said to me to say that one of the VCs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4241.3s	4241.3	 who responded said that the reason they didn't invest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4243.8s	4243.8	 was because the numbers weren't good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4245.6s	4245.6	 That was not my experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4246.7s	4246.7	 When we looked at this company, they had great numbers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4248.9s	4248.9	 It's just, the valuation was ahead of those numbers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4251.2s	4251.2	 but the numbers were always great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4252.6s	4252.6	 I actually responded to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4254.0s	4254.0	 And that was Sequoia partner, Sean McGuire, who said that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4257.4s	4257.4	 And I responded to him like, hey dude,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4259.2s	4259.2	 VC code is you don't reveal the numbers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4262.9s	4262.9	 on things you learn confidentially.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4264.9s	4264.9	 What are you doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4266.2s	4266.2	 And he's like, well, they said some BS about Treva.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4269.3s	4269.3	 I was like, yeah, it still doesn't change VC code
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4271.3s	4271.3	 that if you learn something under NDA,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4273.7s	4273.7	 Friend DA essentially in a meeting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4276.7s	4276.7	 you're not supposed to weaponize that against.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4279.4s	4279.4	 Unless you have a $30 billion position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4282.1s	4282.1	 I still think, well, whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4283.3s	4283.3	 I still think it's like, I've never seen a VC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4285.6s	4285.6	 Honestly, it's the first time I've ever seen a VC do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4288.3s	4288.3	 Jason, come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4289.2s	4289.2	 I think we all knew where he was coming from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4292.1s	4292.1	 He's defending an enormous position of his and Sequoia's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4294.8s	4294.8	 You do that, Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4295.6s	4295.6	 You've always been.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4296.5s	4296.5	 I've never been.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4297.3s	4297.3	 Eric Al.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4298.1s	4298.1	 Eric Al's fired.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4299.0s	4299.0	 But I never released inside information is my point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4301.5s	4301.5	 He didn't say any inside information.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4302.6s	4302.6	 How would he have any inside information
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4304.0s	4304.0	 if he was an investor?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4304.8s	4304.8	 He made a general statement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4306.1s	4306.1	 He made a general statement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4307.0s	4307.0	 He met with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4307.8s	4307.8	 But he was conflicted out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4309.1s	4309.1	 So why would he meet with them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4310.2s	4310.2	 Hey guys, Nick just texted that had I found a way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4313.9s	4313.9	 to get off my lazy ass, not be playing poker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4316.3s	4316.3	 and do that deal, I would have generated a 222X
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4319.1s	4319.1	 on my investment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4320.3s	4320.3	 Which would have been 15 million times 222X.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQc5krOQUYE&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=70&t=4323.0s	4323.0	 Well, we screwed it up too.
