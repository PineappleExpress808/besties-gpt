https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=5.5s	5.5	 Thank God Trump's out.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=41.8s	41.8	 Yay, Sax is so happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=44.4s	44.4	 Trump's out of office.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=45.8s	45.8	 He gave an amazing speech about how great Biden's inauguration was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=53.0s	53.0	 Welcome to the All In Podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=57.1s	57.1	 Oh my gosh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=57.9s	57.9	 With me today in our post inauguration after glow is the dictator,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=64.2s	64.2	 Chumapai Hapitiya, the queen of Kenwa, David Friedberg, and riding the blue wave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=72.6s	72.6	 Diving in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=73.7s	73.7	 No more red pills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=75.4s	75.4	 The blue wave is David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=78.6s	78.6	 Rain Man Sax is with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=81.4s	81.4	 David, how did it feel to watch Biden's inauguration speech,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=86.6s	86.6	 which you said hit all the notes and I see you wearing blue today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=91.6s	91.6	 Let me have a sip of my VUV click-o and tell us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=93.8s	93.8	 You've got the blue jacket, the blue shirt, and the blue headset on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=97.5s	97.5	 You've ridden the blue wave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=99.6s	99.6	 Tell us how you feel with Biden in office.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=101.7s	101.7	 I'm going to drink my VUV.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=103.3s	103.3	 Jason, I'm just happy to see that you're happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=107.6s	107.6	 And does this mean that your Trump derangement is over?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=115.8s	115.8	 You've gone cold turkey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=117.9s	117.9	 You're on the wagon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=119.6s	119.6	 And I'm just happy to have my friend back and not have you part of this Trump derangement zombie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=128.2s	128.2	 hoard that you've been in for the last few years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=132.2s	132.2	 I'll tell you two quick stories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=135.0s	135.0	 The first one turned out not to be true, but there was a New York Times alert
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=139.4s	139.4	 that came out this weekend saying that they were going to lift the travel plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=147.4s	147.4	 For a moment, I was a little in shock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=153.4s	153.4	 I'm Canadian.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=154.1s	154.1	 My family is in Canada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=155.1s	155.1	 I haven't seen them in a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=156.1s	156.1	 My mom is 80 years old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=157.4s	157.4	 I haven't seen her in a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=160.1s	160.1	 And then the second was on the day of the inauguration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=163.5s	163.5	 Biden signed an EO, I guess, that starts to basically create a path to citizenship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=172.8s	172.8	 And there are two women in my life who I think are just lovely, lovely people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=181.8s	181.8	 who I've never been able to hire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=184.5s	184.5	 And now this gives us a path to hire them and compensate them the way that we wanted to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=191.0s	191.0	 The way that we wanted to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=192.3s	192.3	 And so in these moments, I started crying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=195.7s	195.7	 And I've probably had three or four moments and I realized like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=199.1s	199.1	 holy shit, I have had so much pent up emotion waiting for, honestly, just like a normal average
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=207.0s	207.0	 date and like simple, humane, good things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=210.8s	210.8	 And I'm not trying to sort of jump on the Biden bandwagon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=213.4s	213.4	 I think that he's got a lot of work to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=215.4s	215.4	 But I do think that just at a level, simple, basic level of humanity, it was a big sea change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=223.8s	223.8	 How did you take it, Friedberg?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=224.9s	224.9	 I'm curious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=225.7s	225.7	 Did you cry as well?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=227.8s	227.8	 I observed the inauguration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=230.6s	230.6	 It was interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=231.3s	231.3	 We didn't upgrade your firmware.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=232.6s	232.6	 Sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=233.2s	233.2	 We were supposed to push the two David firmwares for the ability to cry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=237.4s	237.4	 But did you feel any emotion of the three emotions we've given you in your programming?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=242.6s	242.6	 Did any of them move at all?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=245.4s	245.4	 I don't remember.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=246.1s	246.1	 I mean, I don't remember the origin of my non-emotional characterization, Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=251.8s	251.8	 But yeah, I think it was based on every interaction we've ever had with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=256.6s	256.6	 But continue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=257.4s	257.4	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=258.3s	258.3	 I guess that makes sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=259.1s	259.1	 So I feel like the Biden moment on inauguration day, it really did feel like a sigh of relief
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=271.4s	271.4	 because so much of Trump love him or hate him has been driven by a degree of tension.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=277.1s	277.1	 Right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=277.4s	277.4	 I mean, he came in to office on the premise that he was going to drain the swamp.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=282.9s	282.9	 I mean, that's kind of a very kind of active position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=287.1s	287.1	 He's going to go away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=287.8s	287.8	 He's going to change things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=288.9s	288.9	 And I think the Biden tone is like, let's take it down a notch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=292.9s	292.9	 Let's all take a deep breath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=294.0s	294.0	 And I feel like that generated a collective sigh of relief.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=297.6s	297.6	 I'll also say that I watched that with the eyes of someone who voted for Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=303.7s	303.7	 I didn't vote for Trump, but I don't think I voted this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=309.5s	309.5	 I can't remember.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=310.1s	310.1	 It was in the middle of the pandemic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=311.0s	311.0	 But I basically feel like there was a lot of folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=316.5s	316.5	 It's easy to say, let's unite the country when you're on the winning side and when you're not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=323.0s	323.0	 And you're sitting there and your guy got kicked out of office and your guy claimed that he got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=329.7s	329.7	 kicked out because of fraudulent activity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=331.8s	331.8	 And you're one of the 46% of Americans that are already disapproving of Biden's performance in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=338.2s	338.2	 his first two days of office.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=341.4s	341.4	 You don't look at that as a moment of relief.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=343.3s	343.3	 You don't look at that as a moment of respite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=346.2s	346.2	 And I feel like there's a little bit of a missed point of view in terms of how we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=351.2s	351.2	 all covering it and talking about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=352.5s	352.5	 It certainly feels good to take the tension down and take a deep breath and have leadership not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=356.4s	356.4	 be putting the tension out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=357.8s	357.8	 But there's a lot of anger and disappointment still festering out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=360.6s	360.6	 And I think we need to be very cognizant of why and what we can do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=364.2s	364.2	 And it would have been nice to see Biden not just say, let's unite, but actually step over the line
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=369.0s	369.0	 and declare some of the policies and points of view of the other side as being valid and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=373.9s	373.9	 engaging more directly on those points versus saying, we'll all work together in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=379.0s	379.0	 And we're already seeing this rift with McConnell and others in terms of how to deal with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=383.3s	383.3	 filibuster in a unified Senate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=385.5s	385.5	 And I just don't think that we're there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=389.0s	389.0	 Sax, what are your thoughts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=390.0s	390.0	 And then we'll go to you, Trimah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=391.6s	391.6	 I mean, look, I'm not going to swoon over an octogenarian reading cliches off a teleprompter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=397.0s	397.0	 I'm sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=397.4s	397.4	 I just can't do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=398.2s	398.2	 Now, that being said, the inauguration speech struck all the right notes of reconciliation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=404.7s	404.7	 lowering the temperature, coming together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=407.0s	407.0	 These are the things you're supposed to say at an inauguration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=409.4s	409.4	 These are the presidential layups, if you will.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=412.3s	412.3	 It's kind of a weird thing that Trump could never quite get these layups in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=416.7s	416.7	 Biden did what he was supposed to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=418.4s	418.4	 And I agree that there is a sense of relief in the temperature being lowered and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=427.0s	427.0	 situation in Washington feeling a bit depressurized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=429.7s	429.7	 And so I think he deserves credit for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=431.4s	431.4	 That's all for the good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=433.0s	433.0	 I think the problem Biden's going to have is not just sort of the Trump right opposing him,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=439.6s	439.6	 but the uncivil warriors in his own party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=443.0s	443.0	 Uncivil warriors, I think, was the most memorable line in his speech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=446.4s	446.4	 There are people, I think, on the left who aren't really on board with the reconciliation agenda.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=452.2s	452.2	 I mean, shortly after the election, you had AOC proposing a truth and reconciliation commission
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=458.6s	458.6	 to go after everyone from the Trump era.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=461.1s	461.1	 I don't think that's exactly the kind of reconciliation Biden's talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=464.5s	464.5	 You have, I think, the repressive hand of big tech playing into this revenge agenda by acting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=469.9s	469.9	 as a speech cartel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=471.2s	471.2	 And now we have the rest of the tech stack jumping on board with the speech cartel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=475.8s	475.8	 You had an announcement from a whole bunch of finance companies, PayPal, Stripe, Square,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=481.6s	481.6	 that said they would cancel the accounts and by implication,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=485.7s	485.7	 livelihoods of anyone connected to January 6.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=489.3s	489.3	 Well, what exactly does that mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=491.4s	491.4	 I mean, there were many thousands of people at this rally on the mall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=495.8s	495.8	 Only a few percent of them breached the Capitol and an even smaller percentage engaged in violence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=500.4s	500.4	 But everybody who was at the mall and really everyone in the MAGA movement is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=504.2s	504.2	 quote unquote, connected to that protest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=507.3s	507.3	 So how many degrees of Kevin Bacon are we going to play in acting out these reprisals?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=514.3s	514.3	 And I think the worst part of all is that now we have in Congress a bill put forward by Adam Schiff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=521.5s	521.5	 that basically would create a domestic patriot act to create giant new surveillance powers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=528.3s	528.3	 for the state to go after people they deem to be traitors and seditionists and domestic terrorists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=535.1s	535.1	 And I actually tweeted a letter by Rashida Tlaib of the squad opposing this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=540.5s	540.5	 It's the first time I stood with the squad I was proud to because the last thing the state needs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=545.3s	545.3	 right now is more surveillance powers. And this idea that we're fighting a war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=552.2s	552.2	 against fellow Americans based on basically political dissent, that's not going to create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=556.9s	556.9	 reconciliation. That's going to lead to the next step in this horrible tit for tat game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=562.4s	562.4	 Just to build on this for a second, there was a Rasmussen poll that came out today. Today is Friday,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=568.1s	568.1	 January 22nd. So two days after the inauguration and Biden's disapproval rating is 45%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=574.9s	574.9	 And all of a sudden you can think again, as you said, three days ago, a lot of people were on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=582.6s	582.6	 the losing side and are now on the winning side. And today, a lot of people that were on the winning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=589.3s	589.3	 side are quote unquote on the losing side. And you see how reflexive the reaction is. It's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=594.7s	594.7	 an auto hate, right? It's like auto disapproval. And so if that's the case, it just begs the question,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=603.9s	603.9	 how much room and how much tolerance will we have as a society if we start to go after folks that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=610.8s	610.8	 effectively have an enormous amount of political dissent? Are there fringes of both parties that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=617.2s	617.2	 need to get basically found out, exposed and put in jail, whether they're Antifa on the left or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=624.1s	624.1	 the far right, extremists on the right? Absolutely. But hopefully the FBI already has enough power to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=630.7s	630.7	 do that. And that's already their remit. And what we're not going to have to do is pass an enormous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=635.4s	635.4	 number of laws. I mean, I've said this before, the Patriot Act was so crazy because there was a foreign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=639.9s	639.9	 actor and a foreign event on domestic soil that created it. But between the pandemic and now what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=644.8s	644.8	 happened in the Capitol, a biological Patriot Act, a domestic Patriot Act, these are all in the offing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=651.5s	651.5	 And I think what we're going to have to do is, again, it sounds cheesy, but find the common
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=657.2s	657.2	 ground so that we can expose who are at the fringes of both parties who are the real crazy people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=662.4s	662.4	 round those folks up and deal with them with the laws that we have today. Because otherwise,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=666.9s	666.9	 the unintended consequences for the overwhelming majority of the Americans who are just normal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=672.6s	672.6	 folks is going to be a little scary. I thought a really interesting reconciliation moment happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=679.7s	679.7	 with the woman who stole Nancy Pelosi's laptop. I don't know if you guys were have read that story,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=685.9s	685.9	 but this woman who stole the laptop and was considering selling it to the Russians or something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=691.4s	691.4	 she's 22 years old. She's obviously was misguided in doing this. And the judge basically explained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=699.7s	699.7	 to her that she was releasing her to her mother's, you know, care and that her mother would go to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=704.6s	704.6	 jail if she did anything further. But she said, listen, you know, you're a beneficiary of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=711.7s	711.7	 Constitution. You are getting a speedy trial. You are getting representation. And she used it almost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=716.7s	716.7	 as a civics lesson. And I think we had a discussion, maybe two episodes when the pot got a little hot,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=724.2s	724.2	 which was great for ratings, by the way, and for our relationships. And it resulted in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=730.2s	730.2	 reconciliation dinner that we had a little a little wives dinner. Our wives brought us together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=735.7s	735.7	 for dinner to just make sure everything was on the well, Chamath, Chamath brought us together for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=739.6s	739.6	 dinner and brought wives. We brought wives. Yeah. And no, I mean, it was it was a good thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=745.4s	745.4	 because frankly, Jason, I was starting to hate you just just a little bit. But I could feel the hate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=752.4s	752.4	 you know, and Chamath being empathetic as he is recognize the situation. And so we've decided to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=759.8s	759.8	 do you know, at least a quarterly besties dinner, you know, to make sure that, yeah, that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=765.2s	765.2	 contentiousness does not get out of hand and interfere with our friendships, which are more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=769.0s	769.0	 important than our politics. Ultimately, that's what we all hope is comes out of this podcast,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=776.1s	776.1	 which is a deeper understanding of reconciliation of of issues that we disagree on. And breaking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=782.9s	782.9	 bread, having a meal or having a civil conversation, even if it gets a little heated, keeping it civil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=787.8s	787.8	 is important. I thought that this is the way to handle it. A lot of these we're going to be able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=793.0s	793.0	 to use some amount of judgment on the people who storm the Capitol and say, Okay, this person's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=797.8s	797.8	 misguided. They took a selfie, this person broke windows, and then this person, you know, through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=803.6s	803.6	 a fire extinguisher to cop and we have to make sure that the justice system is deployed in a fair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=809.4s	809.4	 way and more surveillance and more investigation. I don't think that's the solution. I think more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=816.2s	816.2	 surveillance, more investigations. Absolutely, because I think the FBI has the power today to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=821.5s	821.5	 do that. And I think they should, like I said, they should find every single person involved,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=827.4s	827.4	 find the appropriate crime, make sure that they're punished. But the idea of passing broad sweeping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=832.6s	832.6	 surveillance powers over every American citizen is fucking nuts. Bonkers. And by the way, all that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=838.5s	838.5	 all that's going to do is create these honeypots for foreign governments to want to attack anyways,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=842.5s	842.5	 because if that capability exists, it exists in code on servers somewhere, and folks in China and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=849.7s	849.7	 other places will want to find out where that is, and they will be attacking it all day long. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=854.5s	854.5	 the last thing we need is we're already leaking enough information about ourselves online,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=860.0s	860.0	 willingly and unwittingly. I don't want there to be a honeypot. That's the first thing. The second
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=865.4s	865.4	 thing I just want to say is I thought it was incredible. What Mitch McConnell did just back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=870.5s	870.5	 to your comment, Jason, about making sure folks get the right adjudication. I think Mitch McConnell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=876.2s	876.2	 set the stage to have Donald Trump impeached. And the reason I think that is this was the first time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=882.1s	882.1	 he was completely unequivocal, which is that Donald Trump provoked all these folks. And I think what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=887.8s	887.8	 it allows the Republican Party to do is to get together under closed doors, you know, behind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=892.6s	892.6	 closed doors, circle the wagons and say it's either him or us, we choose right now. And I think what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=898.2s	898.2	 going to happen, if I had to guess, is that that allows a lot of people to break ranks and support
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=904.2s	904.2	 the impeachment in the Senate that's going to start on Monday. And I think there's a real chance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=908.8s	908.8	 now that this impeachment goes through and he gets convicted. I think it's worth just thinking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=913.5s	913.5	 the implications of that. If you did that, there are Trump loyalists, there aren't really GOP loyalists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=920.7s	920.7	 And I guess there are GOP loyalists, but there are a lot of Trump loyalists that are not loyal to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=925.5s	925.5	 GOP at this point. And Sachs, you know, correct me if I'm wrong, but if Trump does actually create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=931.4s	931.4	 a fringe party, does create a patriot party, as he suggested he might, you could see up to 20 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=938.9s	938.9	 Americans joining that party. And you know, that would reduce the ranks of the Republican Party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=943.5s	943.5	 significantly. And in kind of my understanding is in political theory, what would result is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=949.0s	949.0	 you always have a balance in the parties. And so the parties kind of adjust left or right to create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=954.0s	954.0	 that balance. Ultimately, it's just kind of the organic way this works. In order for the Republican
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=959.3s	959.3	 Party to gain, you would probably see a lot of membership move over to the Republican Party,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=965.7s	965.7	 which means that the Democratic Party is going to move further left. And, you know, think about the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=971.2s	971.2	 implications of that. If Trump does actually, if they do actually kick Trump out of the party,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=975.0s	975.0	 and he does set up a fringe party, you will likely see the Democrats move further left, creating a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=981.9s	981.9	 much more kind of conflicting story for some of the centrists than what they're telling today of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=987.1s	987.1	 what's going to happen in the future. And that's a very different America in the next two to three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=991.1s	991.1	 years that could be created if they took that risk. And I think they have to associate that calculus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=997.0s	997.0	 when they're making this decision. You know, you can talk about justice and wanting to kick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1000.4s	1000.4	 him out of the party, but the implications of him leaving the party are rather profound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1005.4s	1005.4	 Oh, it would fracture the Republican Party. It would be, I guess the best historical analog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1011.0s	1011.0	 would be when Teddy Roosevelt left the party to form the Bull Moose Party. He actually fractured
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1017.3s	1017.3	 the Republican Party and that allowed, I think, Woodrow Wilson to win the presidency, beating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1022.5s	1022.5	 Taft. Yeah, I mean, the Republicans would basically lose every election from now until Trump is no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1028.8s	1028.8	 longer, you know, a force in American politics if he created, I guess the- Or they'd have to move
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1034.2s	1034.2	 left, right? I mean, in order for them to gain, you know, more people, they'd have to get the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1038.2s	1038.2	 centrist Democrats, they'd have to move left and that'll give the Democrats the ability to move
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1041.3s	1041.3	 left. Yeah, I mean, it would be a dream scenario for the Democrat Party. I'd be surprised at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1049.2s	1049.2	 end of the day if enough Republicans went along with this to fracture the party. But look, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1057.4s	1057.4	 understand that on some basis, you know, Trump caused what happened at the Capitol. He convened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1064.2s	1064.2	 everybody, he rabble roused. But I think that, frankly, if you have a trial, I think the question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1071.3s	1071.3	 we have to ask is like, what agendas does this serve? Does this serve a reconciliation agenda?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1076.1s	1076.1	 Or does this serve a revenge agenda? I mean, the guy's already out of office. I thought we canceled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1081.3s	1081.3	 the Trump reality show. And this is like bringing it back for another season, because this trial is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1086.3s	1086.3	 going to be a shit show. Just like all things Trump, you have a trial in the Senate and it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1090.5s	1090.5	 going to turn into a total farce. Okay. And, you know, look, I think cosmically, Trump was reckless,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1097.7s	1097.7	 he was responsible. But when you actually look at the legal definition of incitement, it's actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1103.0s	1103.0	 very hard to prove incitement. So now Trump's going to get his lawyers up there, and they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1107.3s	1107.3	 going to be pushing back on this. And it's going to consume the country for months. And I just think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1112.9s	1112.9	 we should be moving forward right now. The guy's already out of office. I thought it was going to be three days and done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1117.0s	1117.0	 Why would it take months? I'm curious. You're just saying you overhang from it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1121.4s	1121.4	 They're going to start at mid February, right? It's not going to be three days. This goes on until
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1125.4s	1125.4	 the trial is over. I mean, it'll be at least a week of discussion, right, Sachs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1131.7s	1131.7	 So Sachs, is it? Do you think prevent the GOP preventing Trump from being able to run again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1139.6s	1139.6	 is worth the year the week of animosity, let's call it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1143.8s	1143.8	 I don't I think we should just move on as a country. And I, you know, at the end of the day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1149.0s	1149.0	 I think that's what's good for Biden's agenda. I mean, this will become very consuming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1153.3s	1153.3	 What's good for the GOP, though, if you're as a person who would align themselves with Republicans,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1158.9s	1158.9	 mainly, I would say, what do you think is best for your party, the party you're part of?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1164.3s	1164.3	 Just moving on, just moving forward. What if Trump comes back and gets the nomination 2024?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1169.9s	1169.9	 I mean, I think that is definitely a risk you take. But I think that risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1175.8s	1175.8	 You know, I'll leave it to the voters to decide what what makes sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1180.6s	1180.6	 Interesting. I think that the only salvation for the Republicans is to repudiate Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1186.2s	1186.2	 And I actually agree with with Friedberg, I think that this creates the opportunity for this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1192.8s	1192.8	 I think Trump wants to call it the Patriot Party to be sort of center right. I think Democrats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1198.2s	1198.2	 probably add over time, you know, center left. And then the Republicans actually are this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1203.5s	1203.5	 interesting power broker, because they can actually tack to the middle and be centrist,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1207.5s	1207.5	 you know, about a social safety net combined with, you know, small government, if you could somehow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1214.4s	1214.4	 tiptoe and balance on that line, I think that is the winning strategy that people want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1219.4s	1219.4	 But I think that's that's my point is the Republican Party is going to have to move left
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1223.8s	1223.8	 in order to create balance between the two parties again, because they are going to lose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1228.3s	1228.3	 20 million voters to the Patriot Party. And that's the profound shift that's going to happen. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1233.5s	1233.5	 when the Republican Party moves left, the Democrats are going to move further left. And so maybe I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1239.4s	1239.4	 don't think that moving that far left is a really winning strategy for them. But I think I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1243.2s	1243.2	 Friedberg is right. So as an example, I think I can say this, but like I had a call this week with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1249.4s	1249.4	 the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez. What an unbelievably impressive guy. Holy fucking shit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1256.8s	1256.8	 this guy is amazing. What he's done in Miami is incredible. I mean, the GDP growth is like Chinese
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1266.2s	1266.2	 GDP growth, 10%, 8%, 6.5%. He's running fiscal surpluses, you know, crime is down, down, down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1273.2s	1273.2	 He's done an incredible job. This guy's a fundamental centrist. You know, and when you talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1278.1s	1278.1	 about what his beliefs are, I was like, what is this guy? Is he a Democrat? Is he Republican? I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1282.2s	1282.2	 was like, he's like, honestly, I'm a centrist. You know, and and so my point is, if whoever attacks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1288.2s	1288.2	 to the middle, we'll find the ability to attract incredible leaders that I think are our next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1296.3s	1296.3	 generation set of leadership. So in that way, Trump as a change agent, Sacks was a success in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1304.2s	1304.2	 that he broke the system. And this was Peter Thiel's kind of concept when he put him in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1309.7s	1309.7	 And I know you don't speak for Peter, but Peter's idea was, hey, this person is a change agent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1314.2s	1314.2	 He's going to be this, you know, drain the swamp person. Maybe that didn't happen, but he has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1318.9s	1318.9	 basically made everybody reconsider what party they want to be part of and what they actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1324.3s	1324.3	 want on the political agenda. And now we're so we've never been more focused on politics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1329.6s	1329.6	 and how our country runs in our lifetime, have we?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1332.5s	1332.5	 Well, Trump, you're right that Trump was a classic disruptor. You know, Keith Raboi has this line
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1337.7s	1337.7	 about founders that disruption is created by disruptive people. And Trump was, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1344.7s	1344.7	 one of those very disruptive people. I mean, just to take two examples, I mean, he created a total
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1349.9s	1349.9	 realignment on our views around China. I think it's now a bipartisan consensus that, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1355.4s	1355.4	 we should not keep feeding China and making keep feeding that the Chinese tiger and turning into a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1362.2s	1362.2	 dragon. Everyone seems to think now that that some reappraisal is warranted. And the other the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1367.8s	1367.8	 big issue was the forever wars in the Middle East. You know, I think Trump first created a realignment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1373.4s	1373.4	 within the Republican Party when he said no more bushes. He meant no more of these stupid foreign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1377.7s	1377.7	 wars. And I think that was an important realignment. So yeah, I mean, he's been a very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1382.9s	1382.9	 disruptive figure. I think that everyone's breathing a sigh of relief because we've moved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1387.2s	1387.2	 on. I think that he unnecessarily was incendiary and sort of pressurized the situation. But I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1395.4s	1395.4	 the best thing at this point is to move forward and not keep rehashing the Trump era.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1400.6s	1400.6	 Speaking of rehashing, I don't know if you guys know about what is happening with Facebook,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1407.2s	1407.2	 but they have an oversight board they created last year in the spring. And the oversight board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1413.8s	1413.8	 is not to do the day to day policing of Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp activity, but it is to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1421.3s	1421.3	 be a place where people who have been have had content removed or have had their accounts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1425.8s	1425.8	 suspended to appeal. They have taken the Trump case, as it were, and given it to their Supreme
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1434.2s	1434.2	 Court, which is the oversight board. And the oversight board is going to make a judgment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1440.2s	1440.2	 basically on should Trump get his social media accounts back, they have complete autonomy from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1446.0s	1446.0	 Facebook, they are funded by Facebook with 120 or $130 million over the next six years. So they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1451.5s	1451.5	 getting like $20 million a year to run this. They've got a really amazing bench of intellectuals,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1457.7s	1457.7	 public intellectuals, and they're sort of above Facebook in this regard. What do we think should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1464.2s	1464.2	 happen to Trump's social media accounts? Should he have a path to reclaiming them? And with this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1471.8s	1471.8	 board that exists as this a budsman, as I talked about in the last episode, what do we think of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1476.4s	1476.4	 this process? And do we think maybe Twitter and YouTube should join this oversight board?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1482.1s	1482.1	 Let's separate these two things. And actually, Jason, you just framed it perfectly. Let's separate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1486.3s	1486.3	 the two issues. One is, is any of us comfortable with a random set of people that some people will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1492.0s	1492.0	 like and other people not like making these decisions on our behalf that are not necessarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1496.0s	1496.0	 trained to make these decisions? I mean, these aren't elected trained judges or lawyers that sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1500.9s	1500.9	 for a bar exam. These are just, you know, private citizens, ultimately, at the end of the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1506.9s	1506.9	 I think that if you allow this to happen at scale, there's going to be a bunch of decisions that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1511.8s	1511.8	 you'll be okay with and support. I think a lot of people probably are cheering when Trump got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1515.9s	1515.9	 blocked. But if you can abstract it away and think about all the people that you actually care about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1521.2s	1521.2	 what if the administration was on the other side, and now all of a sudden, you know, these people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1525.4s	1525.4	 to curry favor with the administration went in a different direction and people that you cared
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1528.9s	1528.9	 about got blocked. It is an untenable situation. And I think this is the slippery slope that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1534.2s	1534.2	 framers never intended. I don't think it should be people like this, making any decision like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1540.2s	1540.2	 And in many ways, it's a it's a fig leaf for these companies to pretend they're doing the right thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1545.1s	1545.1	 while they're really shirking the real responsibility. Friedberg, you agree?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1549.1s	1549.1	 It's hard to say on this specific. So I think we should just take a broader point of view on this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1554.6s	1554.6	 which is how do tech companies create independence in the platforms that they're building so that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1561.0s	1561.0	 they don't get scrutinized as monopolists. And so there are several examples of this being done,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1566.5s	1566.5	 both successfully and not successfully across the tech ecosystem. Google made Android open source.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1574.4s	1574.4	 And by making the Android operating system open source, they were able to have their own forked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1579.0s	1579.0	 versions that they were able to install on phones with partners like HTC and Samsung and others
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1584.9s	1584.9	 that they could then have their search engine be the primary search engine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1588.2s	1588.2	 So the entire Android operating system is available for anyone to work on, for anyone to fork,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1593.1s	1593.1	 for anyone to use. And then Google's iteration of that open source platform and Google's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1597.4s	1597.4	 contributions, which they were making regularly, allowed them to kind of have a great commercial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1602.7s	1602.7	 outcome without being the owner of the operating system, having learned from the mistakes of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1606.3s	1606.3	 Microsoft in the past. Facebook tried to take a similar approach with Libra and it was a total
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1611.7s	1611.7	 shitshow and a disaster. I don't know where it is today, but they tried to create this also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1616.2s	1616.2	 independent board to provide oversight and to kind of do all the open source work on the Libra
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1624.9s	1624.9	 currency. And Facebook was going to then use that on their platform as their kind of token
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1631.8s	1631.8	 cryptocurrency solution. And obviously there was so much scrutiny because no one believed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1637.0s	1637.0	 the independence. And I think we're hearing the same thing now about the Facebook oversight board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1641.0s	1641.0	 Jack Dorsey is now taking the same approach with Blue Sky, which is meant to be this open sourced,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1648.6s	1648.6	 independently managed social media protocol system. And so Twitter would effectively become
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1656.5s	1656.5	 an application layer on top of this open sourced approach to how do you decide what goes on social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1662.6s	1662.6	 media? How do you decide what's inappropriate and appropriate and what technology protocols
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1666.5s	1666.5	 are available for everyone to use and what business and arbitration protocols are available for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1671.9s	1671.9	 everyone to use in an open source way. And we'll see where Jack goes with Blue Sky. He seems to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1676.7s	1676.7	 be doing a better job messaging and organizing teams of people to work on this. And I don't see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1681.4s	1681.4	 the pushback that Facebook is getting with their oversight board. So unfortunately,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1687.2s	1687.2	 a lot of these, the big tech platforms in order to avoid the monopolistic allegations and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1691.7s	1691.7	 allegations of control and influence, they're creating independence, independent systems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1697.4s	1697.4	 and the titter miss. And I don't think we yet know. I think in the next year or two, we'll see how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1701.3s	1701.3	 Blue Sky, Libra, the Facebook oversight board and some of these other platform deep platforming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1707.0s	1707.0	 approaches. What would you do? Let me just put it to you. If you were in charge, you were the CEO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1711.0s	1711.0	 of Facebook or Twitter, would you have a path to reinstating Trump? Yes or no?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1715.5s	1715.5	 And then I'll jump in on that. Yeah, let me just get freeburgs. Would you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1719.4s	1719.4	 yes or no, reinstate Trump? Oh, yeah, 100%. We should have a path to it. I think the like I've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1724.2s	1724.2	 said in the past, having some objective, I think that number one, I don't think it was inappropriate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1728.3s	1728.3	 for them to kick him off the platform from a legal perspective. I don't, Saxon, I might disagree, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1732.8s	1732.8	 we can probably argue for an hour. But I think from a freedom of speech point of view,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1735.9s	1735.9	 they're private companies with private accounts, and they did what they wanted to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1738.9s	1738.9	 Was it the right thing to do? I don't think that was the right thing. So you would give him a path
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1743.0s	1743.0	 to getting his account back for I think you need to create an objective system and you need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1746.8s	1746.8	 give everyone whether it's Trump or whomever else, everyone has to have the same set of standards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1751.8s	1751.8	 that they're held to. And then a universal approach that anyone can appeal and okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1756.0s	1756.0	 but that's the approach. But knowing what Trump did on January 6, would you let him back on your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1760.6s	1760.6	 platform? If you were CEO is the question I'm trying to get out of your free bird. But okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1764.0s	1764.0	 David, you go. Yeah, I mean, so here's the fundamental problem is that the town square
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1769.7s	1769.7	 is now owned by Facebook and Twitter, the town square got privatized. And our speech rights
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1775.8s	1775.8	 are now in the hands of Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey as a practical matter. I mean, you do not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1780.6s	1780.6	 have speech rights in the modern world if you get deplatformed by big tech. And until now, there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1785.7s	1785.7	 been no way to appeal their decisions, we have had no transparency into their decisions. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1790.6s	1790.6	 I think Facebook creating this appeals board is a step in the right direction. But you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1795.4s	1795.4	 they're calling it their Supreme Court. But I'll tell you, my Supreme Court is the Supreme Court,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1799.8s	1799.8	 you know, at the end of the day, we all know that the most important part of a trial is jury
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1803.8s	1803.8	 selection. And Zuckerberg is still picking these 20 people. And you know, actually, just in case
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1809.4s	1809.4	 in point, he picked the top, he picked the four and the four pick the next 16. And then they don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1814.6s	1814.6	 have an ongoing ability to pick the next ones. And they have some amount of terms. So just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1821.0s	1821.0	 to give you that. Okay, well, fair enough. And like I said, look, I don't want to criticize this move
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1825.6s	1825.6	 on its own, because it is a step in the right direction, we need an appeals process when people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1830.2s	1830.2	 get canceled. Okay. That part is good. But what I would like to see, like I said, my Supreme Court
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1836.0s	1836.0	 is the Supreme Court, and they've spoken to this issue. And I would like to see these social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1840.4s	1840.4	 networking monopolies apply a First Amendment standard, a speech policy broadly consistent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1845.8s	1845.8	 with the First Amendment. And sometimes that will mean allowing speech we don't like, but it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1851.2s	1851.2	 will result in a greater level of speech protection for all of us. Well, it would allow speech back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1856.2s	1856.2	 on the platform. No, but hold on a sec. If you're going to go by that standard. The problem is with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1859.7s	1859.7	 this oversight board concept is that it completely violates exactly what the Supreme Court is meant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1865.0s	1865.0	 to be, which is a country by country set of governance and standards and laws. Like I'm just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1870.6s	1870.6	 looking at the oversight board people right now. These people look incredibly well credentialed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1875.9s	1875.9	 Emi Palmore of Israel, Catalina Botero-Marino of Colombia, Nigat Dade from Pakistan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1881.6s	1881.6	 Helle Thorning-Schmidt from Denmark, Catherine Chen from Taiwan, Jamal Green from the United
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1886.0s	1886.0	 States, Alan Rusbridger from UK, Andreas Sajo from Hungary, and it goes on and on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1892.3s	1892.3	 How are we supposed to adjudicate a set of standards at a national level? Like when we have the,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1900.1s	1900.1	 are all these people from all these different countries supposed to apply on US constitutional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1903.8s	1903.8	 right of free speech and have an idea? The idea would be they would use some global standard,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1908.3s	1908.3	 but then also take into consideration local standards. That's what they've, their stated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1911.7s	1911.7	 purposes and why they're so diverse. The setup for that though, Jason, is that then we know when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1916.7s	1916.7	 when there's a, you know, the Hindu nationalist BJP party has a specific point of view. And so when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1921.4s	1921.4	 Modi wants to get elected, there's going to be specific kinds of free speech laws there. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1926.0s	1926.0	 Poland's going to have a different point of view, and they're not going to respect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1930.1s	1930.1	 what's happening in the oversight board. Case in point, Australia passed a potential law,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1935.4s	1935.4	 or is considering passing a law, which is basically around if, you know, treating Facebook and Google
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1941.3s	1941.3	 as quasi publishers and that, you know, they're, I think that they have to pay some kind of royalty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1945.4s	1945.4	 now for articles that are shared or published or whatever. And Google said, I'm out. And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1951.1s	1951.1	 Facebook said, I'm out too. And so what does that mean for, you know, 200 million people? You're out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1959.4s	1959.4	 What does that mean? You're out. You can make money when the getting's good. And all of a sudden,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1962.5s	1962.5	 you build this public infrastructure when the country's rules change. I actually respect that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1967.7s	1967.7	 more than trying to create some of this broad holistic governance committee, because I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1972.3s	1972.3	 it's a shit show. You can't cherry pick which laws you want to observe and respect and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1977.0s	1977.0	 which laws you don't. You know, I think Jamath makes an excellent point about how difficult this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1982.2s	1982.2	 is going to be to implement. Let me propose an alternative that actually comes from a former
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1987.5s	1987.5	 law professor of mine at the University of Chicago, Richard Epstein. He made the point that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1993.0s	1993.0	 he wants to apply common carrier regulation, at least in the US, to these monopolies. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=1998.8s	1998.8	 the example he gives is that the railroad monopolies could not deny you service based
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2003.5s	2003.5	 on your political views. And, you know, this is a real issue. Imagine, you know, going back in time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2010.7s	2010.7	 you know, we had the Lincoln-Douglas debates, for example. The way that Lincoln and Douglas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2014.9s	2014.9	 went around the country was by train. Imagine if some railroad magnate, some oligarch said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2020.4s	2020.4	 Mr. Lincoln, I don't like your views. I'm not going to give you passage on my railroad monopoly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2026.7s	2026.7	 The common carrier rules would have prevented them from doing that. And what Epstein suggests we do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2032.5s	2032.5	 is if you're essentially a monopoly, a speech monopoly in the US, one of these platforms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2039.9s	2039.9	 has gigantic network effects, you have to apply the common carrier rules.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2045.7s	2045.7	 It's an interesting concept, I think. Let's move on to the economy. And it'll be interesting. We'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2051.9s	2051.9	 monitor obviously what this oversight board does. We're going to monitor what's going to happen with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2056.9s	2056.9	 this January 6th insurrection. By the way, sorry, Jason, the last thing on this is you can tell,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2062.7s	2062.7	 if you've if you graphed, and I'm sure somebody listening to All In can graph and tweet this, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2069.4s	2069.4	 if you graphed the price to earnings ratio of big tech, as all of these issues have come out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2079.8s	2079.8	 if you looked at a time series of their PE, and you put on their things like George Floyd,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2086.7s	2086.7	 things like the Capitol riots, all of these things that have created these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2092.1s	2092.1	 flashpoints, issues around free speech, flashpoints, the massacre in New Zealand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2096.7s	2096.7	 and Christchurch that was live streamed on Facebook, all of this stuff, what you'll see is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2101.0s	2101.0	 at least capitalism is voting that these companies will not be allowed to be companies much longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2108.2s	2108.2	 So, the smart money is betting that they're going to be regulated and something's going to change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2111.9s	2111.9	 It's going to be a quasi-governmental organization, exactly, that the level of regulation at a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2115.8s	2115.8	 government by government level is going to be so onerous as to make these companies quasi-nonprofits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2121.4s	2121.4	 that work on behalf of countries. Yeah, they're going to become utilities,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2124.6s	2124.6	 right? They're going to get regulated like utilities at some point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2127.4s	2127.4	 Or they're going to have to adopt some governance, like we've talked about, or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2133.8s	2133.8	 other options will emerge. And I think what Jack is doing with the blue sky is what they're calling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2139.5s	2139.5	 it. Blue sky, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2140.5s	2140.5	 Yeah. What they're really doing with blue sky is saying your profile and your data is going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2145.4s	2145.4	 stored on some blockchain or some decentralized system like Bitcoin or like any other peer to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2152.7s	2152.7	 peer service, which means it's not on their server. Twitter just pulls all that data together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2158.0s	2158.0	 So, we would all have our own domain names in calacanis.com or sax.com slash profile dot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2166.6s	2166.6	 whatever the HTML equivalent is, let's just call it dot social. You know, your sax dot social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2173.3s	2173.3	 URL would be your profile on Facebook, Twitter and everywhere else. And when you post it to it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2178.4s	2178.4	 it would post to Facebook and Twitter. Therefore, they could say, we don't actually host this stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2182.6s	2182.6	 We're just pulling it together, which then destroys their business model perch moths point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2186.5s	2186.5	 What do we think as a little aside is going to happen with the tick tock case? Now that Trump is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2193.1s	2193.1	 out of office and Biden is in office, we sort of alluded to China, sacks being a super important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2199.4s	2199.4	 thing that we all have consensus on now, what should happen with tick tock? And do you think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2203.9s	2203.9	 Biden will go after tick tock and say, hey, we got to get this out of here, because it's,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2207.7s	2207.7	 you know, essentially spyware and Jockma was just resurfaced. And let's just talk about China for a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2213.1s	2213.1	 second. Yeah, I think the sad reality is that the whole tick tock thing is gonna get swept under
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2218.2s	2218.2	 the rug. I think there'll be no restrictions on tick tock. I think what we need the issue with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2224.9s	2224.9	 like, with banning tick tock, though, is that it's just one place where China can collect data on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2230.6s	2230.6	 all of us. I mean, the reality is there's thousands of places. And so, you know, I do think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2236.3s	2236.3	 taking some action on tick tock is warranted, but it would it is a little bit of selective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2240.7s	2240.7	 enforcement. But what I would like to see is some guarantee some assurance that, that tick tock is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2248.7s	2248.7	 not is collecting data in the way they're saying they're collecting it and that there's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2254.6s	2254.6	 sort of spyware within the app. And I don't think we know for sure whether there's spyware or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2259.8s	2259.8	 I'll say it I'll say it slightly differently. I've maintained this for a while, but it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2262.9s	2262.9	 inconceivable that inside of big tech and every single company that you define big tech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2270.3s	2270.3	 is not at least one spy from Russia, China, India, Israel, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2282.1s	2282.1	 Did I tell you guys I had a spy working for me? A climate? No, you got rest. No, tell us the story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2288.6s	2288.6	 It's public. So I'll share it. We had a data scientist named Hightow, a great guy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2294.4s	2294.4	 worked on our remote sensing team, and worked on our nitrogen model, which predicted nitrogen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2300.0s	2300.0	 content in soil and was very deep in the code base and everything. And shortly after I had left,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2307.5s	2307.5	 I found out this climate just for the audience, my company I started and ran was acquired by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2312.6s	2312.6	 Monsanto in 2013, which is a big seed company. A lot of people know it for other things. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2318.7s	2318.7	 so I left and I found out that the guy quit, went to the airport, and the FBI intercepted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2325.7s	2325.7	 him at the airport and they found tucked into his bag a thumb drive and he had downloaded all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2330.9s	2330.9	 our code base for our nitrogen models. And he was taking them to give them to the Chinese government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2335.5s	2335.5	 And so he's in jail right now. He's in prison in the US right now. But this was like the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2339.4s	2339.4	 nondescript, super nice scientist, data scientist guy you've ever met. Like you would have had zero
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2346.4s	2346.4	 suspicion. And it turns out he was a spy. How many of those exist in Facebook and Google?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2352.4s	2352.4	 And by the way, it was so easy for him to get access to our code base. And he pulled all this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2355.8s	2355.8	 stuff down and he had the whole model. And there's a lot of articles about what happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2360.7s	2360.7	 in our case. But you're right, it's happening all over the place. And I don't think that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2366.3s	2366.3	 fully appreciate how much of America's IP is stored in software and data and how accessible that is to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2373.8s	2373.8	 employees inside of these organizations and that the security is not adequate to protect that data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2379.1s	2379.1	 and that IP. And then the crazy thing is like, you know, when just to connect the two dots here on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2383.3s	2383.3	 this Jack Ma thing, like when you saw that video, where like, you know, basically he was forced to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2389.2s	2389.2	 you know, show fealty to, I'm okay. And, you know, this is all about the Chinese party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2395.2s	2395.2	 I'm not being held captive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2397.5s	2397.5	 My gosh, like, I mean, these are all quasi governmental companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2401.2s	2401.2	 Alibaba exists because of the largesse of the Communist Party in Xi Jinping. If that wasn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2407.7s	2407.7	 clear after last week, I mean, and so to your point, like, you know, if any company gets a hold of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2413.6s	2413.6	 US user data or otherwise, it's effectively the Chinese government getting a hold of that data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2418.6s	2418.6	 Yeah, we don't need proof, David, when Jack Ma disappears and then comes back and looks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2423.4s	2423.4	 he looked nervous on that video. I'm no expert, but he did not look like he was the Jack Ma
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2429.1s	2429.1	 who was giving speeches and inspiring people. And I don't know what this does to entrepreneurship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2434.4s	2434.4	 in China, but I mean, who in China is going to start a company now and want to be the next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2440.6s	2440.6	 Jack Ma or Jeff Bezos? No, I think, I think Jason, it's even simpler.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2444.4s	2444.4	 What happens? It makes entrepreneurship even simpler,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2447.5s	2447.5	 meaning for those entrepreneurs that thought that there was a balance between financial imperative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2451.7s	2451.7	 and moral imperative, there's no balance. You can flush the moral imperative down the toilet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2457.3s	2457.3	 China will allow you to get super rich and super successful as long as you super tow the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2464.4s	2464.4	 And that's the message. Right. It's like what Putin did with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2468.3s	2468.3	 Kordakovsky in Russia. It's like he basically told all the oligarchs, you work for us now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2473.8s	2473.8	 And it worked. That's basically the message from the CCP to Jack Ma and to every other entrepreneur
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2482.6s	2482.6	 in China is you work for us now. And by the way, civil military fusion was a policy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2488.7s	2488.7	 expressly announced by President Xi. One other data point on this, I think it's really interesting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2494.6s	2494.6	 is that Biden just announced that he was keeping on Christopher Wray as the head of the FBI.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2501.4s	2501.4	 Christopher Wray gave a speech back in July at the Hudson Institute about the counter espionage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2508.3s	2508.3	 efforts that the FBI is engaged in. And he was saying that the FBI has more cases now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2514.6s	2514.6	 related to Chinese counterintelligence. He said that the FBI is opening a new China related
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2521.6s	2521.6	 counterintelligence case every 10 hours. Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2526.4s	2526.4	 Two a day. And of the nearly 5,000 active FBI counterintelligence cases currently underway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2532.1s	2532.1	 across the country, almost half are related to China. So this is directly from a speech he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2537.3s	2537.3	 gave in July. So I think it's really interesting. Now, at the time that he gave the speech,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2542.0s	2542.0	 a lot of people were saying, well, this is just Trump's more of Trump's China baiting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2546.1s	2546.1	 But I think that by Biden keeping on Chris Christopher Wray, there's a continuity of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2551.0s	2551.0	 policy there. And I think focusing on TikTok is probably the wrong thing. We need a more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2556.0s	2556.0	 comprehensive policy to deal with counterintelligence. Well, it's a good start,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2560.4s	2560.4	 though, to say if you hit scale, we're not going to let you operate here. And we want reciprocity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2564.8s	2564.8	 Adding to this outgoing Secretary of Pompeo and is the day before the inauguration,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2572.2s	2572.2	 tweeted I have determined that the People's Republic of China is committing genocide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2575.8s	2575.8	 and crimes against humanity in China targeting the Uyghurs, Muslims and members of other ethnic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2583.5s	2583.5	 and religious minority groups. That's quite a bomb to leave the day before. And I think this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2588.2s	2588.2	 signals we are going to keep resetting this relationship. And what an incredible opportunity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2593.5s	2593.5	 for us to bring factories back here bring, as we've talked about here, manufacturing back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2597.9s	2597.9	 correct, Freeberg? That's what I think. Let's kick it off. We got we got three million factories in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2604.6s	2604.6	 China. I think we've got less than 100,000 in America. Let's go. It will be so glorious. It
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2610.5s	2610.5	 will be so fucking glorious. I mean, think about this, right? Look, think about the amount of money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2615.2s	2615.2	 like at the end of the day, what is a government's purpose? Is it to run or profit? No,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2619.4s	2619.4	 you know, that's our job, right? Is it to run at break even? I would actually say no,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2625.1s	2625.1	 I think it's to basically promote the prosperity of current and future generations of its citizens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2631.8s	2631.8	 And so you should be investing. So if this is the investment, so if we're going to be printing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2636.2s	2636.2	 you know, trillions of dollars, and you know, we should talk about the stimulus bill, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2639.6s	2639.6	 Biden's going to rip in another two trillion, which I think is a perfect and then, by the way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2644.1s	2644.1	 and then after that, there's going to be this it's amazing infrastructure bill, put the money to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2649.4s	2649.4	 let's reclaim a bunch of this capability on shore and let's rebuild America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2655.2s	2655.2	 Okay, free Berg, you looked at the $1.2 trillion stimulus package that Biden is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2662.1s	2662.1	 proposing. How much of that goes towards rebuilding factories in America?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2666.2s	2666.2	 Well, none. So remember, there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2669.9s	2669.9	 Yeah, but it's 1.9 billion. Yeah, it's 1.9 trillion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2673.6s	2673.6	 1.9 trillion. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2674.6s	2674.6	 Yeah. And so just to put that in context, you know, Wall Street has talked about there were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2679.4s	2679.4	 going to be four massive stimulus bills, you know, since last April, May, I think they've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2684.4s	2684.4	 talked about this. And we're seeing this come to fruition now. And Shamath, correct me if you've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2688.2s	2688.2	 heard differently, but there's always been the expectation we would have the big first stimulus,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2692.4s	2692.4	 which we had last March, then a second stimulus, people have been waiting for the state stimulus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2697.6s	2697.6	 or the local government stimulus, which this one now captures. And then the fourth program was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2702.1s	2702.1	 always going to be infrastructure. And we haven't seen details of the proposed Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2706.2s	2706.2	 infrastructure plan yet. But I'm pretty sure it's going to have a lot of green energy stuff tied up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2711.6s	2711.6	 in it. But let's just let's just hit the numbers, right. So in 2009, post financial crisis to keep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2718.4s	2718.4	 the global economy from collapsing, Congress passed an $800 billion aid package. 800 billion was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2727.9s	2727.9	 extraordinary at the time, and we'd never seen anything like it. TARP. And last March, if you'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2733.7s	2733.7	 recall, we passed this emergency $2 trillion package, you know, more than 2x what we had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2739.9s	2739.9	 during the financial crisis. And now just in December, right before the year wrapped up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2744.1s	2744.1	 Congress passed another $900 billion package. And now we're talking about this $1.9 trillion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2749.2s	2749.2	 package getting passed. So we've eclipsed anything you could have ever considered possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2755.0s	2755.0	 in terms of fiscal stimulus. At this point, the M1 money supply, which I sent the link out ahead of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2760.9s	2760.9	 this for negative share, has gone up by 75% in just the past year. And now if we break down the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2767.3s	2767.3	 $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, you know, a huge chunk of it, and this is what Wall Street's been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2773.0s	2773.0	 waiting for, is $350 billion is going to state and local governments. So think about San Francisco
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2779.0s	2779.0	 or the state of California, the city of Chicago, the city of New York. All of these folks have seen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2785.3s	2785.3	 their revenue decline, and they've had to run massive emergency programs. Where's that money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2790.2s	2790.2	 coming from? They haven't been able to raise taxes. They've had to put a hold on receipts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2794.8s	2794.8	 And so this is meant to bridge the gap at the local level. And this is really important,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2799.7s	2799.7	 because so much of capital markets still very much fund local and state governments through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2806.8s	2806.8	 municipal bonds. And those bonds, if they start to default, are going to have a dangerous rippling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2811.8s	2811.8	 effect in the economy. So bridging the state and local government budgets with this $350 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2817.4s	2817.4	 package turned out to be, you know, an absolute need. And the Republicans prior to the election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2824.0s	2824.0	 were pushing hard against this and saying, let those states fail. They're mostly blue states.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2827.7s	2827.7	 Let those cities fail. They're mostly blue cities. They're mismanaged. They're being stupid about how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2831.9s	2831.9	 they're operating. So this is a big deal. There's $160 billion for COVID fighting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2837.4s	2837.4	 some of which, you know, I throw up on $20 billion for vaccination, which equates to about $150 per
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2843.3s	2843.3	 person they expect to vaccinate, which is an extraordinarily high cost if you actually think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2847.1s	2847.1	 about it on a first principles basis. It's ridiculous how inefficient they're going to be at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2851.4s	2851.4	 $50 billion for testing, $40 billion for protective gear and supplies. And what this indicates to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2858.5s	2858.5	 is so much of what goes on in government and government spending is skating to where the puck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2863.0s	2863.0	 used to be, not skating to where the puck is going. And it's almost like by the time this money gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2868.0s	2868.0	 deployed, I'm not sure we're going to need as much protective gear and supplies. I'm not sure we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2872.2s	2872.2	 going to need as much testing if we can actually get the vaccinations done in the next 90 to 100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2876.0s	2876.0	 days. And much of the country starts to recover from this. You know, you've now got $150 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2881.1s	2881.1	 program sitting out there that doesn't need to be out there, and it's a waste of money. What we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2884.6s	2884.6	 should be doing is taking that money and investing in bio manufacturing infrastructure,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2888.7s	2888.7	 so we can more quickly develop and deploy vaccines in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2892.3s	2892.3	 What would it cost to build a factory just back of the envelope that was capable of making
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2897.5s	2897.5	 the next, you know, let's call it one to one to two billion shots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2901.5s	2901.5	 One to two. Yeah, it's not a lot. So it's not a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2904.3s	2904.3	 Let me I'll give you guys the unit economic build. And you can do the math at home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2909.0s	2909.0	 Four grams per liter is the expected yield of a of a bio manufacturing facility. And a liter is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2916.8s	2916.8	 like, you know, how many liters of water do you have in a tank? You can build half million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2922.0s	2922.0	 liter facilities for a couple hundred million dollars. And that's four grams per liter every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2927.4s	2927.4	 seven days. And as vaccine or the antibody therapies that we've seen, the antibody therapies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2933.6s	2933.6	 are about two grams and that'll save someone's life. The vaccines are a fraction of a gram.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2939.9s	2939.9	 And so you can start to kind of do the math on how just a few billion dollars invested in building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2944.6s	2944.6	 some of these bio manufacturing facilities that are modular and can be very quickly reprogrammed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2949.0s	2949.0	 to make a new molecule can be used to support the future vaccine supply chain and the future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2956.5s	2956.5	 antibody therapeutic supply chain, which is critically needed in this country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2959.8s	2959.8	 And if I were to take one hundred sixty billion dollars for COVID fighting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2963.0s	2963.0	 give me 10 percent of that and we'll be ready for any virus in the future. And we'll be able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2967.7s	2967.7	 to print out vaccines for the whole country within 30 days. And so a little bit again of this is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2972.6s	2972.6	 really forward thinking. It's scientists and doctors saying what they need, what they're talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2976.5s	2976.5	 is last year's need. They're not thinking in terms of what the industrial supply chain needs are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2980.2s	2980.2	 going to be in the future on an ongoing basis for this country. At this point, I'm not seeing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2984.0s	2984.0	 And so I feel a little bit let down by that. And I hope that the infrastructure programs that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2988.2s	2988.2	 going to be proposed in the next in the next bill will start to encompass some of that work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2993.4s	2993.4	 Paradoxically, it's going to cost a trillion dollars to upgrade our nuclear weapons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=2998.8s	2998.8	 So we're literally going to spend a trillion dollars over the next decade upgrading
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3003.0s	3003.0	 our nuclear weapons. Is that true? That's nutty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3006.9s	3006.9	 That's right. I'm reading a headline right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3010.0s	3010.0	 Here's my here's my little wish list for this infrastructure bill. I think when you look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3015.8s	3015.8	 some of the most compelling work that's happened in the developing world. So like if you're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3020.6s	3020.6	 to go and build a massive water facility or an energy installation, a lot of people are worried,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3028.9s	3028.9	 hey, listen, I have to deal with local currency risk. I have to deal with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3034.4s	3034.4	 corruption. I could have the government take away this facility from me without notice. The rule of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3039.4s	3039.4	 law may not be strong. And the World Bank has this mechanism where you can basically go and ensure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3045.0s	3045.0	 you know, for I think it's like one or 2% of your project costs the whole project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3048.8s	3048.8	 And it really makes things work. I would love to see the US government effectively create a program
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3056.4s	3056.4	 that is similar but different in the following way. There are some enormous things America needs to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3063.0s	3063.0	 where the IP exists with our allies. And there is an enormous fear what would happen if that IP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3072.6s	3072.6	 leaked specifically to China. One example is if you believe and you care about climate change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3080.2s	3080.2	 and the making of batteries, there's an enormous amount of IP that sits with the Japanese
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3086.5s	3086.5	 that you know, if we could license and work with as a country, we could build factories all over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3091.7s	3091.7	 the country. And we would be the leader in climate. But that'll take the US government to basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3097.4s	3097.4	 work bilaterally with the Japanese government to basically say, listen, if it takes the NSA to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3102.5s	3102.5	 fucking protect this shit, we will do it. But you can say-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3105.9s	3105.9	 Or you run them. We could just give them their sovereignty in those factories or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3109.4s	3109.4	 You know, these are for profit companies that are relatively risk averse. They're not going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3113.6s	3113.6	 to rip in 10 million bucks to 10 billion dollars to build a cathode plant in the US. I would,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3119.3s	3119.3	 other people would. But that's my hope in the infrastructure bill is that we take some of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3124.4s	3124.4	 things that have worked in the developing world and we use it to grease the skids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3128.6s	3128.6	 in how we rebuild America. It would be fucking glorious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3131.4s	3131.4	 And also just think about how much a nuclear power plant costs. It's like six to nine billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3135.0s	3135.0	 dollars to build a nuclear power plant. And we haven't built many new ones and we're on the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3141.0s	3141.0	 there. But if part of this trillion dollars, we could build 10 more of those energy independence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3145.5s	3145.5	 would continue and global warming would go down. Anything to add there, David? Looks like you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3150.1s	3150.1	 to comment? Well, just one final word. You know, the great Senate leader, Everett Dirksen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3158.6s	3158.6	 famously said that a billion here, a billion there, pretty soon you're talking about real money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3163.6s	3163.6	 And now we're talking about a trillion here and a trillion there. And these are really big numbers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3170.0s	3170.0	 And I think we should be very concerned about debt and deficits. No one's really talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3174.4s	3174.4	 this yet, but all of this money has to be paid back at some point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3177.2s	3177.2	 Well, what's the worst that can happen, David? Let's actually do that. I mean, I'm asking the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3182.6s	3182.6	 question in a non joking way. What is the worst that can happen? Oh, I mean, a debt crisis,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3188.0s	3188.0	 inflation, inflation, well, not not just so inflation, because the government will eventually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3191.7s	3191.7	 have to monetize the debt by printing more money. The dollar stops becoming the world's reserve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3196.0s	3196.0	 currency. Maybe Bitcoin becomes the world's reserve currency. Maybe something else does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3201.1s	3201.1	 It could be lead to, you know, very severe to basically a debt crisis in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3206.6s	3206.6	 What would that look like for companies and citizens of America?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3210.5s	3210.5	 Well, if you're middle, if you're middle class, your savings get wiped out, you know, if you so,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3214.5s	3214.5	 so if you're super rich, the reality is there's already been tremendous asset inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3219.4s	3219.4	 So there's already been a lot of inflation. But frankly, if you are very rich and own assets in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3224.8s	3224.8	 the stock market, you're you're sort of, you're protected, you know, but if you're a middle class
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3229.8s	3229.8	 person with most of your savings in your bank account, that money is not worth a lot less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3234.2s	3234.2	 Or your home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3234.6s	3234.6	 You're destroyed. Or your home. Yeah, you get destroyed by that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3238.0s	3238.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3238.1s	3238.1	 It's really very sad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3239.1s	3239.1	 So if you are in equities and the market is on a rip, you know, paying an extra couple of million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3244.2s	3244.2	 dollars for your second home is not a big deal, because your equities have gone up more than that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3249.0s	3249.0	 are equal to that. And if you're somebody who makes income, we have a separate issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3254.3s	3254.3	 Let's look, this is this is a this is a bigger issue. But I and I think we should talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3258.4s	3258.4	 this at some point, because this is what the grand fallacy of technology was supposed to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3263.1s	3263.1	 Like, you know, if you if you break down capitalism into its two most natural states,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3267.6s	3267.6	 you have labor and you have capital, right, you have workers, and you have owners. And the biggest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3273.7s	3273.7	 problem that technology did was it drove a wedge and it created an extremely small owner class,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3279.5s	3279.5	 and an extremely massive labor class. And so the reality is that a very few very handful of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3285.2s	3285.2	 can can get extremely wealthy by being owners of these next generation assets. And then everybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3291.4s	3291.4	 else is essentially, you know, rendered as labor. And so this wealth inequality just grows and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3296.6s	3296.6	 grows and compounds. And so we have to figure out a way. Yeah, how's that different than the past?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3302.3s	3302.3	 Because I think it's got I think I think technology accelerated that dynamic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3305.9s	3305.9	 Well, I think jumping in on this, I mean, I think that technology creates bigger winner take all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3311.5s	3311.5	 outcomes, and that's fed into inequality. But the good thing about tech or the tech ecosystem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3316.3s	3316.3	 is that frankly, we have option pools, right, we have broad based ownership of these companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3320.4s	3320.4	 if you go work for a Google or Facebook, whatever, you know, come on. Yeah, but that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3327.1s	3327.1	 10,000 people. That's 10,000 people. No one there and they're replacing two million jobs with 10,000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3333.0s	3333.0	 people. I mean, this is why this is why we need to have 100% participation in the markets by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3339.3s	3339.3	 everybody in the country. Joe Greenblatt, who I had on my podcast recently is a proponent of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3343.6s	3343.6	 Chamath. So you're tweeting about it. When you're born in the United States, we should put $5,000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3348.2s	3348.2	 in a 401k that you can't touch until you're 65 years old. That is in whatever index funds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3355.0s	3355.0	 and every person born gets that $5,000 and cannot touch it. And then we see where it winds up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3359.8s	3359.8	 I'm not sure it's all it doesn't it doesn't solve the problem that a lot of people have to climb
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3364.7s	3364.7	 up a hill first, right? They take on a lot of debt to get education to put themselves in a position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3369.3s	3369.3	 to ultimately be able to generate the income to do that. And I think, you know, sure, give them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3373.2s	3373.2	 $5,000 in the beginning, but it's not going to get them where they need to be. But it does solve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3377.6s	3377.6	 one portion of the problem, which is they don't have participation. And we could take out the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3381.5s	3381.5	 wondering what your retirement is going to be like. I think both of you are right. I think like there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3385.4s	3385.4	 needs to be something that allows people to have a line of sight to savings like a lot a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3391.2s	3391.2	 about being invested in, in anything where you own it, whether it's real estate, or whether it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3396.7s	3396.7	 piece of artwork, or whether it's stocks and bonds, so many people don't even know how to begin and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3402.2s	3402.2	 don't understand the concept of ownership. And so they are stuck in being in the ghetto of labor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3407.8s	3407.8	 And I think like one of the biggest things we can do is you can give them the taste of ownership so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3412.5s	3412.5	 they understand that difference so that they want to be an owner. Yes. Okay. Number one. Yes. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3417.8s	3417.8	 then to David's point, number two is we still have a responsibility to educate people so that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3423.0s	3423.0	 can actually have skills that they can monetize. And we have a responsibility to do that. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3428.8s	3428.8	 right now, we make it so fucking hard. And we trick people because like we we send them down the path
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3434.7s	3434.7	 of getting a $200,000 art history degree, and then they end up working at a Starbucks and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3438.8s	3438.8	 they're which is impossible to monetize. I mean, it's ridiculous monetize that you can't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3443.8s	3443.8	 By the way, by the way, what you're saying, Chamath is the reason I think retirement accounts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3447.5s	3447.5	 were set up in the US was to shift away from pension fund models where people were getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3451.8s	3451.8	 a fixed income at retirement, and shifting them to a model of equity and ownership in the markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3456.6s	3456.6	 where they could participate actively on a tax free basis. But obviously, it hasn't done enough,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3463.4s	3463.4	 I think the big difference between the industrial revolution, the first and second industrial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3467.5s	3467.5	 revolution and where we are with software in the last two to three decades is the capital required.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3474.2s	3474.2	 It's very little capital to build a highly valuable software business. It required a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3478.6s	3478.6	 of capital to build oil infrastructure and railroad infrastructure and factories. And so to your point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3483.6s	3483.6	 you get extraordinarily different outsized returns today than you did 100 years ago as an owner versus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3489.4s	3489.4	 labor. And the bridge to try and give people ownership through retirement accounts certainly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3494.3s	3494.3	 hasn't been enough. So to your point, David, I saw this study, it was fucking crazy. I'm going to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3500.2s	3500.2	 the exact numbers wrong, but the trend is accurate. When people used to actively manage their 401k,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3508.7s	3508.7	 there was a very small participation rate, but the mean return was off the charts and the amount of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3513.8s	3513.8	 dollars as a function of their paycheck was off the charts. Call it 50, 60 cents of every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3520.0s	3520.0	 theoretical dollar you could put into it. The minute that we went to passive and that you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3531.4s	3531.4	 but then the amount of that max dollar went off of a cliff. And so the problem that we've had is we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3538.0s	3538.0	 haven't taught people. We've misdirected some of them to say, have a 401k, it replaces your pension

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3550.3s	3550.3	 people how to actually manage it. It's not that hard and the basics can be taught very simply,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3555.9s	3555.9	 but right now we are massively exacerbating this wealth gap, the way that we behave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3561.0s	3561.0	 And then all of this money that's going to go in, this 1.9 trillion, whatever, how many trillion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3565.1s	3565.1	 comes afterwards is frankly for the few that are smart enough to take advantage of it will be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3569.8s	3569.8	 amazing, but it'll still push the overwhelming majority of Americans who are stuck in labor

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3579.7s	3579.7	 It is definitely every little bit helps, right? If you have the 401k, that helps and then educate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3586.1s	3586.1	 people. And I think if we gave everybody an ISA at birth or an income sharing agreement for these

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3665.5s	3665.5	 This problem has to get fixed because I think in the next 10, I think in the next 10 and 20 years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3671.4s	3671.4	 the United States is going to fucking reemerge like a phoenix. And the reason is going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3677.6s	3677.6	 because of innovation around climate change and agriculture and biotechnology and technology.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3688.9s	3688.9	 20 or 30 trillion dollars a year for the next 10 and 20 years, 300, 500 trillion,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3696.2s	3696.2	 how the fuck do we make sure that more than 18 people participate?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3700.9s	3700.9	 Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3703.3s	3703.3	 Well, so I agree with a lot of what you guys are saying, but I can tell you every single one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3707.7s	3707.7	 of the companies that I've invested in are looking to hire people right now. They cannot hire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3712.2s	3712.2	 people soon enough. It's their biggest challenge. And it's not just coders. It's salespeople. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3717.7s	3717.7	 marketing people. It's HR people. It's every role in their company. They have trouble trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3722.9s	3722.9	 hire the right person. And they give options to all those people. So it's not just a small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3728.1s	3728.1	 number of founders getting equity. This is basically a new category of call it entrepreneurial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3733.8s	3733.8	 labor. It's labor who gets ownership in the company that's never existed before. And really,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3739.2s	3739.2	 what this comes down to is we need more people participating in the new economy. If you participate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3744.2s	3744.2	 in the new economy, then you get ownership. And if you're in the old economy, then you really are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3748.9s	3748.9	 stuck in labor. And so what we need to do is spread the opportunity that that technology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3754.6s	3754.6	 represents to more people across the country. As part of the minimum wage, maybe we should have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3757.9s	3757.9	 a minimum equity participation. So we have the minimum wage over here. But if you're working
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3761.8s	3761.8	 for an entrepreneurial enterprise, why not get a minimum participation in equity?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3766.7s	3766.7	 Because the free market takes care of that. I mean, if you have the right skills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3769.1s	3769.1	 The free market hasn't taken care of it, David. That's the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3771.4s	3771.4	 No, no, no. The free market has. I agree with David. The free market has.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3774.5s	3774.5	 The problem is with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3775.4s	3775.4	 How does a person working at Walmart ever participate in the Walmart appreciation of that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3779.7s	3779.7	 That's the point. They will leave and go to a company that gives them equity. And that's why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3783.4s	3783.4	 you'll see this migration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3784.4s	3784.4	 That's convenient to say, but if Walmart's the only job within an hour of their house, it's not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3789.5s	3789.5	 They got to have the right skills, Jason. And so this all comes back to education.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3793.5s	3793.5	 You know, we got to, we got to give people the right skills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3794.7s	3794.7	 Yeah, but why not let the people who are in rank and file jobs, the 30 million truck drivers, cashiers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3799.9s	3799.9	 et cetera, have equity participation as a right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3802.4s	3802.4	 I think, I think you're saying something different. Should they? Absolutely. Should the company that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3807.8s	3807.8	 does that be created? Absolutely. Will they be rewarded with all the people that want to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3812.9s	3812.9	 there? Absolutely. So now somebody should go and start that company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3817.8s	3817.8	 Okay. I just think it's an interesting concept. I mean, we do have a minimum wage. Why not have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3822.2s	3822.2	 minimum? Jason, you just had, you know, the same woman that ran Elon out of California,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3828.7s	3828.7	 Lorena Gonzalez, she's doing another thing now, just propose a new bill. Like, do you want her to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3833.7s	3833.7	 basically pick the equity thresholds? Because that's what you're saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3838.8s	3838.8	 Well, no, let's let's pivot. Let's go to California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3841.6s	3841.6	 Okay, let's pay it to another disaster. So the recall is well on its way. They need to get 1.5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3849.8s	3849.8	 million signatures. We're at 1.1 or 1.2, but we actually really need two because there's some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3853.7s	3853.7	 verification process that goes on. So in all likelihood, we will see Gavin Newsom recalled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3859.9s	3859.9	 We agree on that. Yeah, I'll tell you this. The stats I heard, there's about a million,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3863.8s	3863.8	 call it a million million one signatures. They've seen about an 85% verification rate today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3869.2s	3869.2	 Sachs correct me if I'm wrong on this. They're getting they're getting about 200,000 signatures
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3872.6s	3872.6	 a week. They're you know, the cost for marketing and attracting people to get these signatures is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3878.9s	3878.9	 coming in at like three to six bucks a signature. So it's really not a lot of money is needing to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3882.8s	3882.8	 be spent to get this done. And, you know, even if the verification rate drops to 75 or 65%,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3890.2s	3890.2	 you're still on track at this rate to hit the recall target by March 17, which is the deadline.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3896.8s	3896.8	 And so it appears highly likely they're going to get there. Sachs, am I right on all that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3901.7s	3901.7	 Yeah, I think they're at 1.2 million signatures. That's what I heard. And they're trying to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3905.5s	3905.5	 they're trying to get to 2 million to have a buffer so that, you know, they that you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3910.3s	3910.3	 they don't get pushed under the but 1.5 is the number they need. Yeah, they need 1.5 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3915.9s	3915.9	 certified signatures. 70% of the way they're according to the website recall Gavin 2020.com,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3920.7s	3920.7	 which I think I think I think they will get there. I think they'll get there. And then there and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3925.7s	3925.7	 the recall election would take place about four to five months after after that, there's a couple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3931.8s	3931.8	 of months where it moves through the Finance Committee, the recall election has to be budgeted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3937.4s	3937.4	 And then Newsom would have the opportunity to set a date within I think, 60 to 80 days, roughly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3944.6s	3944.6	 So I think we're looking at July for a recall election. And Sachs, how do you get? How does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3952.0s	3952.0	 a candidate get on the ballot because Chamath is asking for a friend?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3958.5s	3958.5	 Wait a second, I want to be on to that. Can we have all four besties be on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3962.2s	3962.2	 Yeah, we should we should all we should all run.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3967.8s	3967.8	 Let the voters decide. A squad we're gonna. Yeah, we're probably gonna have four Kardashians on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3972.7s	3972.7	 there. So four besties on there. And what Kardashian? Yeah, so the it's it's it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3979.4s	3979.4	 stunningly easy to be a replacement candidate. We should expect there'll probably be about 150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3983.5s	3983.5	 replacement candidates on the ballot. Every every third tier C-list celebrity is gonna,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3990.0s	3990.0	 you know, like, you know, back to Gary Coleman did it like, you know, 20 years ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=3994.5s	3994.5	 they're all very C-list celebrities. Yeah, to try and boost their Q rating. I'm sure we'll see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4000.8s	4000.8	 Kathy Griffin on there. I mean, what she'd been doing. And so it's going to be a farce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4005.7s	4005.7	 It's going to be a farce. Andy Dick is going to run for governor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4011.4s	4011.4	 Can we can we just can we just can we by the way, can we talk about why he's getting recalled?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4015.9s	4015.9	 Because I do get this question a lot from people in tech and out of tech. And I just want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4021.0s	4021.0	 highlight some of the reasons I've heard and I'd love to hear why you guys think he's you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4025.4s	4025.4	 why there is this push against him. But from people within the tech community, I've heard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4030.0s	4030.0	 that the ad hoc lockdown rules have really pissed a lot of people off in terms of when businesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4035.3s	4035.3	 are allowed and not allowed to be open and kind of the responsiveness and the guiding principles
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4038.6s	4038.6	 around this during COVID. Obviously, the you know, the inability to fight against the tax rate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4043.6s	4043.6	 but no one wants to be publicly saying that the failed vaccine rollout the failed testing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4050.2s	4050.2	 You know, sex, Chamath, Jason, what do you guys think is the reason he's getting recalled? What
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4055.6s	4055.6	 are the top five? Hypocrisy is number one. I think it's the hypocrisy of going to restaurants and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4061.0s	4061.0	 then making people not go to the beach, which is crazy. And then I think number two is the virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4065.4s	4065.4	 We've only deployed 37% of our doses in California. And that makes us, you know, of the major states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4073.8s	4073.8	 that are putting out a lot of these vaccines, one of the worst performers, second, yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4081.4s	4081.4	 Florida, and New York are the other large states and they're at 56, 49 and 50%. We're still stuck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4087.0s	4087.0	 at 37%. California, the cradle of innovation and technology. And this bum, he's a bum 37%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4094.8s	4094.8	 deployed. We should be leading 70%. He's a bum. Can I get it? It's it's new some derangement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4101.4s	4101.4	 syndrome. Oh my god. No, I'm trying to get a viral clip. I'm trying to get a viral clip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4107.4s	4107.4	 Jason just has a problem with anyone in authority. You know, it's the hair. It's a problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4111.6s	4111.6	 Great fucking hair. It's the hair is too good. French laundry, the hypocrisy and then get to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4120.6s	4120.6	 Personality for you is the biggest driver. Is that right, Jason?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4123.6s	4123.6	 No, it's literally the performance of their Washington, D.C., West Virginia, North Dakota,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4128.2s	4128.2	 South Dakota, all 66 to 73% of their vaccines are both their double us. Now it's smaller states,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4135.0s	4135.0	 but still we're goddamn California. Here's what I would say as a list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4141.2s	4141.2	 Number one, we're the most heavily taxed. Number two, we are we have some of the worst
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4148.6s	4148.6	 infrastructure in the country. We have some of the lowest and poorest performing schools in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4154.2s	4154.2	 country. We have the highest homeless rates for veterans in the country. We have the worst
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4159.3s	4159.3	 preparedness for climate in the country. It's basically just a complete bungling at every level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4169.1s	4169.1	 And then the fourth or then the last, which is the biggest one, is we have now created an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4173.5s	4173.5	 inhospitable culture for innovation. The biggest problem with that is if these climate jobs and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4181.0s	4181.0	 these technology jobs and these biotechnology jobs pivot to more accepting and progressive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4189.6s	4189.6	 local and state managements like Austin, Texas and Miami, Florida, we lose these things forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4197.0s	4197.0	 This is a multi-generational decay that we're starting. And so if we care about the state,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4202.0s	4202.0	 I love California. I love San Francisco. I love how eclectic and unique and different it is. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4206.6s	4206.6	 was always happy to pay 10, 11, 12, 13, 14% because it was worth it. Now I don't know what we get for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4214.2s	4214.2	 it. And so I think he should get recalled. I just think he's trash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4218.7s	4218.7	 Is it true? Yeah. And just to underscore the point on lockdowns, we now have certainly more cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4227.4s	4227.4	 We have more deaths and we have more deaths per capita than Florida, despite the fact that Florida
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4235.0s	4235.0	 has no lockdowns and a much older population. And so I was just in Florida a few weeks ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4240.3s	4240.3	 like Jamoth was saying, Suarez, the mayor there has created really a land of the free. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4247.2s	4247.2	 it's really unbelievable. You can go to bars, you can go to restaurants. There's no lockdown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4250.6s	4250.6	 whatsoever. They don't have as big a problem as California does right now. Why do you think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4255.2s	4255.2	 is? Because I think that the lockdowns- On a scientific basis, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4260.6s	4260.6	 I think the lockdowns only forestalled the problem. Eventually the virus finds a way around them. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4265.9s	4265.9	 I also think the thing that's happening in Florida is that, okay, so my aunt lives there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4270.2s	4270.2	 She's in her seventies. She's not going to bars and restaurants because she knows she's highly at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4274.5s	4274.5	 risk. And so just because the government doesn't lock down, doesn't mean that people don't take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4279.3s	4279.3	 sensible precautions on their own. And so I think that what's happened is that people are going out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4284.8s	4284.8	 to bars and restaurants are low risk and they're keeping the economy going over there. And instead,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4289.7s	4289.7	 in California, we have this very draconian lockdown policy and it's put all these small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4294.2s	4294.2	 businesses out of work. No, no, it's worse. It's not a draconian lockdown policy. It's a whipsaw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4299.0s	4299.0	 Oh, it's open. Okay, great. Now go and invest in a bunch of cat-backs to make sure there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4302.7s	4302.7	 outdoor dining. Oh, hold on. You're closed. What is that? That's just stupid. It's incompetent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4308.2s	4308.2	 Tons of restaurant and bar owners in San Francisco spent on average $30,000 building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4313.0s	4313.0	 outdoor seating for their facility only to have it all shut down three and a half weeks later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4316.8s	4316.8	 Incompetent. Can you imagine being an owner of that business? What the experience must have been like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4321.1s	4321.1	 No, I mean, you would literally, they're going to kill themselves. This is the tragedy of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4325.4s	4325.4	 People will lose everything and there'll be suicides, depression, domestic violence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4328.8s	4328.8	 And then this guy's having dinner at French Laundry during the whole, I mean, it's just such a bad look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4333.7s	4333.7	 I just got a note that he's actually been banished from being at the French Laundry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4339.3s	4339.3	 Apparently, it's been renamed the Sri Lankan Laundry and some notable Sri Lankan billionaire has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4345.8s	4345.8	 bought the French Laundry. French Laundry, by the way, got a, they got a $2.6 million PPP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4352.7s	4352.7	 loan that got forgiven. So, you know, there's a lot of heat on the French Laundry as a whole.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4357.4s	4357.4	 What does it cost to go to French Laundry? $800 a person? Anybody who's listening to this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4361.8s	4361.8	 who wants to go to the French Laundry, stay at home, pour a bunch of salt on whatever you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4366.4s	4366.4	 going to eat. Melt a stick of butter in the microwave. Drink it and then basically take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4373.4s	4373.4	 $1,500 light it on fire. You bid to the French Laundry. You're welcome. Here's what you do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4378.9s	4378.9	 Take a really great steak. Trash. And then cut it into a cube and throw out 80% of it. That place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4384.2s	4384.2	 is trash. And then put the cube in the middle of a big large plate. That's not even Nouveau
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4388.8s	4388.8	 Reiche. It's just Nouveau Stupid. Oh, that's terrible. I got trash. Meanwhile, people are down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4394.0s	4394.0	 in like Texas getting like a brisket burrito for $4. But I think California really needs to fix this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4402.7s	4402.7	 We need to figure out what's going on. And I just want to ask one more question of you guys. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4407.2s	4407.2	 don't think that this, you know, because I was having this debate with my family about Newsome,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4411.8s	4411.8	 and I was telling them about the perspectives I was hearing from tech people, and why everyone's so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4416.0s	4416.0	 against Newsome. And I've heard all these different things that you guys have shared today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4419.7s	4419.7	 And you know, they're very, you know, and I'm hearing a lot of people kind of making the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4423.0s	4423.0	 counterpoint like, this is a very difficult time. It's been an impossible year for everyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4429.0s	4429.0	 everywhere. So first of all, you know, Newsome was dealt a pretty difficult hand to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4433.9s	4433.9	 And at the same time, we are all psychologically primed to look for grass being greener on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4439.8s	4439.8	 other side. I think a big part of you know, certainly there's a lot of people leaving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4443.0s	4443.0	 California, my belief for Texas and Florida, primarily because of taxes. And then you justify
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4448.8s	4448.8	 it with all the things that are wrong with California. But we're all really primed right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4453.7s	4453.7	 with this notion that that it's a difficult place to be. But we're also really having a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4458.6s	4458.6	 shitty year. We've had this pandemic, businesses have been shut, you know, everyone's sick,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4462.9s	4462.9	 the economy's having issues. I mean, you know, there's a really difficult hand that's been dealt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4467.7s	4467.7	 Well, I don't buy that as an excuse for Newsome. I mean, look, it is true that we're going through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4472.8s	4472.8	 a very difficult time. But the reason I don't buy that as an excuse for Newsome is because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4476.5s	4476.5	 this is not April or May of 2020, when we thought the fatality rate was 7%. And you know, lockdowns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4482.7s	4482.7	 could be justified then. But we now have so much more data, we've seen that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4488.2s	4488.2	 states that did not do lockdowns like Florida and Texas, frankly, have been no worse off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4492.3s	4492.3	 than those that have done very severe lockdowns. And so what is the point of continuing with this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4496.5s	4496.5	 facade? And that is what I think we can legitimately blame Newsome for is the failure to learn and to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4503.2s	4503.2	 change course based on data. And where is the daily press briefing on what's happening?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4509.8s	4509.8	 I think most of the spread is not happening at businesses, it's happening in homes. And in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4514.9s	4514.9	 California, we have a particularly difficult problem because of multi generational family
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4519.3s	4519.3	 homes, especially in the Latino communities that have been hardest hit by COVID. And the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4525.7s	4525.7	 transmission rate- They also happen to skew with diabetes as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4528.2s	4528.2	 Yeah, the transmission rate in those communities is three to five X what it is elsewhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4533.1s	4533.1	 And I think, you know, and that is not a result of businesses being open. In fact,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4537.4s	4537.4	 those communities are also suffering the biggest hardships because businesses are closed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4542.1s	4542.1	 Well, by the way, this goes to the vaccination strategy, just being so idiotic, like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4546.6s	4546.6	 if you wanted to be equitable, then why weren't we just rolling through and basically getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4552.0s	4552.0	 those families to be vaccinated first independent of age? You know, you're, you're, you're,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4557.8s	4557.8	 all these vaccination sites, nobody shows up. I spoke to SFDPH, Department of Public Health about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4563.1s	4563.1	 this last week, and they told me that they cannot get those communities, they're very non trusting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4567.6s	4567.6	 of the vaccine. And they're having a real struggle getting people to sign up to take the vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4571.8s	4571.8	 The problem is, even if that is the case, the problem is you should not be holding up vaccines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4576.9s	4576.9	 for one community. Then get everybody else vaccinated so that you cut the head off this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4581.8s	4581.8	 fucking transmission. Over 60 gets it. That's it. There's nothing to discuss. Let's wrap up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4587.3s	4587.3	 Everyone gets it, but you allocate a certain number of doses to you. You basically have like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4591.4s	4591.4	 a TSA pre-check line. If you're over 60 or you're in certain communities, you jump to the front of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4595.1s	4595.1	 the line and that's it. But everyone can stand in line and put fucking shots in arms. Cause everyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4599.4s	4599.4	 I know that's over 65 can't even get an appointment and it's bullshit. And the whole thing is, is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4604.9s	4604.9	 is incompetence. So I think, but I think what Zach said is so right. It's like in these moments,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4609.5s	4609.5	 J Cal and Friedberg, like a light gets shone on the ability for people to figure things out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4616.9s	4616.9	 And then you know what the intellectual capability of these people are. And like, look, we saw the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4623.5s	4623.5	 intellectual incapability of Trump. Cause we all say this guy could not adapt. Okay. And,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4631.2s	4631.2	 and so we are now seeing the intellectual incapability of Gavin Newsom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4636.0s	4636.0	 And I just think they're, they're part of the same lot. They're just kind of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4639.4s	4639.4	 you know, people who are in over their head. And they're beholden to people who got them there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4647.0s	4647.0	 And their number one concern is staying in office, which means appeasing a bunch of special interests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4652.2s	4652.2	 Speaking of special interest, David Sachs is still on tilt about conservatives being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4658.2s	4658.2	 canceled. David, you wanted us to wrap with this Wilkinson cancellation. So every podcast,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4664.5s	4664.5	 we're going to have a right winger who's canceled and David's justification for putting them back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4668.9s	4668.9	 on the platform. Go David. Well, actually, so yeah, this is, this is, this is the issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4674.7s	4674.7	 Cancellation of the week with David Sachs. Yes, yes. It's well, this is actually,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4679.1s	4679.1	 it's not a, it's not a left wing. So this is the issue to draw on social media right now is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4684.2s	4684.2	 a writer named Will Wilkinson was just fired from his job and canceled. But here's the thing. It was,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4688.6s	4688.6	 he's not a conservative. He's actually a liberal. And it was a, yes. And it was a right wing tweet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4694.8s	4694.8	 mob that got together to get him fired. Yes. And so how did you get this mob together to get him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4700.8s	4700.8	 canceled? Yeah. So we're back everybody. So much for the wives dinner. Oh my God. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4709.5s	4709.5	 I'm going to need another wives dinner. Well, no, I look, I feel the need to speak out on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4714.1s	4714.1	 because I got to make it really clear that I do not support cancel culture when perpetrated by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4719.0s	4719.0	 the right against the left. I think it's what did he do? Okay. So he posted a tweet making a joke
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4725.4s	4725.4	 that maybe it was important. It's not that funny. Basically saying that if we want unity, the one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4730.3s	4730.3	 thing that like the Trumpers and the Biden supporters can agree on is hanging Pence, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4735.8s	4735.8	 it's what is hanging, lynching, lynching, yes, he used the word lynching or hanging. He said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4742.3s	4742.3	 he said hang, I think. No, I think he said, I said hang. Oh, maybe it's in taste. And it's inciting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4748.9s	4748.9	 violence on the march. Go ahead, sex. It's important. Well, no, look, it's a, it's a, it's a,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4754.3s	4754.3	 it's a joke. That's not actually that funny. And maybe in poor taste, what he's referring to is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4758.2s	4758.2	 fact that the, you know, that there were people on January 6 who were going after Mike Pence, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4763.4s	4763.4	 That was sort of the joke. Anyway, look, he, that's not the point. He deleted it. He apologized for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4769.3s	4769.3	 it. His boss is still fired him for it. Nobody believes that he was trying to incite violence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4775.0s	4775.0	 Okay. I mean, come on, we all know that was not inciting violence, but, but the mob pretended
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4783.1s	4783.1	 that he was in order to create its phony outrage. And then his bosses have to pretend that he was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4791.0s	4791.0	 in order to appease the mob. And they pretend like it was incitement to violence so they can fire him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4796.4s	4796.4	 And then he even had to pretend that he was inciting violence because he had to then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4801.0s	4801.0	 objectively apologize for it. And there's this, that's the thing about cancel culture. I really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4804.9s	4804.9	 don't like it. It's just, it's just so fake and phony. We all have to pretend and things that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4809.4s	4809.4	 aren't true in order to pacify some, you know, tweet mob whose outrage is manufactured anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4815.4s	4815.4	 And I don't like seeing the right doing this. And that's what I tweeted about. And then we had all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4819.9s	4819.9	 these people on the right responding to me saying an eye for an eye, you know, you know, the left
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4824.2s	4824.2	 deserves this too. Now they're going to get a taste of their own medicine. And the problem with that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4828.2s	4828.2	 is, look, you know, you're, you're, you might win this particular battle, but you're losing the war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4833.0s	4833.0	 because you're now buying into the premise of cancel culture. You're now buying into this idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4838.2s	4838.2	 that we need to economically cancel people who disagree with us. And I really reject that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4844.4s	4844.4	 It's certainly bad timing to say, lynch or hang whichever word he used, obviously lynching is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4850.2s	4850.2	 much worse word. After people were chanting hang Mike Pence, but he was making a commentary on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4856.6s	4856.6	 The joke didn't land. And when the joke doesn't land, you need to just take ownership of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4861.0s	4861.0	 and say that you shouldn't be canceled. It's just say it was a poor attempt at humor. I apologize.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4865.1s	4865.1	 Right. And Jason, you know better than anybody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4867.5s	4867.5	 When a poor joke land.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4873.2s	4873.2	 Here's one thing to learn about comedy. People don't remember the jokes that don't land. They
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4876.7s	4876.7	 remember the ones that land. Okay, everybody. It's like investing in startups. It's like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4881.1s	4881.1	 you got a lot of losers to find the few winners. Absolutely. That's my, I'm a volume guy. You know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4885.4s	4885.4	 that governor Trimoth.com governor, sax.com governor, freeburg.com and governor. Can I just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4891.4s	4891.4	 say, Jason, Jason, if, if new SIM is recalled, I would like to put my name on the ballot and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4896.6s	4896.6	 my commitments are quite simple. I just want to, I'm going to cut the taxes to zero and I'm going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4901.2s	4901.2	 to basically create an incredibly pro climate change jobs and pro tech jobs and pro biotech jobs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4910.2s	4910.2	 economy. And I'm going to raise teacher salaries and I'm going to give everybody a school voucher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4915.6s	4915.6	 Okay. Maybe, maybe, maybe on the next episode, we can all declare that we're running for governor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4921.3s	4921.3	 and present our platform. Let's do that. Let's do that. Next Friday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4925.0s	4925.0	 All right. If I were governor Trimoth.com governor, sax.com governor,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4971.9s	4971.9	 Oh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4981.1s	4981.1	 we should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy. Cause they're all just like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4985.5s	4985.5	 like sexual tension, but they just need to release them out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrskYD_6Vk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=123&t=4989.3s	4989.3	 What? You're the bee.
