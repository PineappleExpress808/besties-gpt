https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello, everybody. Welcome. We are live at the all in headquarters. And the all in podcast is now live. We have 63 people watching already. And bear with us while we get the besties on the line. I'll be doing my introductions in just a moment after I tweet this. But it is an eventful night and we had to start early. Because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=26.8s	26.8	 it's looking like this could be another shocker. And I am not being facetious here. I am not happy about this, obviously. But Trump looks like he's been underestimated. Again, this is not a blowout. We are going live early. This could be a shocker, folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=56.8s	56.8	 Okay, so with me early on the pod is regular David Friedberg. David, you're watching this early action. And what's your early reaction to what we're seeing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=70.4s	70.4	 You know, Trump's moved. We there's nothing definitive yet. But he's moved in the results and he's moving markets. We're seeing Forex markets show a sharp indication that Trump has a real shot at winning here. Treasury markets. And as Phil Helmut will share with us betting markets as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=96.4s	96.4	 So it is more it is more of a nail biter than a game seven of the Warriors Cavs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=102.4s	102.4	 So here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=103.4s	103.4	 There's a hell of a nail. There's a hell of a nail biter guys. And I'm just going to say this. The UK markets had it first. They sw- he was five to two. You could you could get Trump at five to two, two and a half to one. Then it hit five to four. And I thought that was quite crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=118.4s	118.4	 And they're saying, Oh my God, Biden's winning this. No, they're not even in the right neighborhood. I'll never watch a network again on election night. And now the market from five minutes ago 368 million pounds wagered 368 million pounds. Trump is now a three to 10 favorite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=144.4s	144.4	 Okay. So for people, Phil, who are not gamblers, if you bet three dollars, you bet three dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=152.4s	152.4	 No, no, Jason, you have to understand if you bet $13, okay, you don't get 13 back. You only get 10 back. Okay. Now, if you want to bet Biden, it's seven to four. So if I bet $70, if I bet $40, I can get $70 back on Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=169.4s	169.4	 Now the shocker is right around 628 PM. The betting odds, the markets were have been in Biden's favor for three straight months. I've been live posting them on my Twitter all day. The worst I saw was Trump was Biden was minus $1.25.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=186.4s	186.4	 Still a big favorite to win. And then boom. And, you know, there are people in my house that are actually crying. You know, I'm very much more in the middle of this thing. But all of a sudden Trump, all of a sudden it was five to four, then it was even.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=201.4s	201.4	 And then all of a sudden Trump was nearly a two to one favorite. I'm getting live information from my friends right now. I'm seeing that it's a little bit lower on some of these sites.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=215.4s	215.4	 I saw 267. That's for a $200 bet. So he's a pretty big favorite. I saw the lowest I've seen is 217. But Jason, if you're watching the odds and I put some stuff on my Twitter, it's amazing how it went from, you know, minus $1.70, you know, all the way down minus a 30. Then it came all the way up to minus $1.70. This is crazy. And I've seen this movie before in 2016, actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=242.4s	242.4	 Okay, so we all know that you need 270 electoral votes to win. And that there were a couple of states that were critical for Trump to win. And it seems like those states that Trump was critical to win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=257.4s	257.4	 He has now won. So let's bring in David Sachs. David, we just turned on the live stream. And boy, is this a turn of events that I don't think any of us except for maybe you. But you were very pessimistic on the last maybe three or four, all in podcasts, you're watching these results come in, the betting markets have totally flipped to Trump. What are you seeing? And what can we expect tonight? What are you looking for?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=287.4s	287.4	 Yeah, I mean, it's looking just like 2016. I mean, you're right that I was looking at the polls in the last few pods that we've done. And there was no way to say anything other than, you know, Trump was the was the underdog. But at the same time, I still thought that Trump had a really good shot because I was watching both candidates on YouTube all the time. They both were doing live events. I wasn't watching it with the commentary. I wasn't watching it with the comments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=314.4s	314.4	 I was watching Biden do these parking lot events. And I would see Trump do four or five events a day flying from tarmac to tarmac on Air Force One having these huge crowds. I saw him do this event in Butler, Pennsylvania over the weekend, it looked to me like there was tens of thousands of people there. And I remember Trump saying a line like, you know, this doesn't seem like a second place crowd.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=332.4s	332.4	 I saw him do this event in Butler, Pennsylvania over the weekend, it looked to me like there was tens of thousands of people there. And I remember Trump saying a line like, you know, this doesn't seem like a second place crowd. And, you know, it's one of those Trump lines. But you know, it did put in my mind this idea, you know, he's got a point. Whatever the polls say, we're seeing 10s of 1000s of people show up at these events, who are fanatical, I mean, just fanatical for Trump. And so,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=362.4s	362.4	 you always had to think that he had a chance of pulling off an upset, just like 2016.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=367.8s	367.8	 I will say what I said on our text earlier. Donald Trump ate the COVID virus and killed it with his body. And then he stood in front of the White House and ripped his shirt off and let us all know that he is our leader. He did not get elected. He claimed victory beginning in 2016. And he has not and will not let go since then. And I think it is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=392.9s	392.9	 cult of personality that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=395.8s	395.8	 cult of personality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=398.0s	398.0	 draws so many people in that are just, you know, feeling like they need change and they need leadership and they don't need something from the old school. And he, he stood up and he showed us that this whole thing is a fake. COVID is a fake. Government is fake. The people are fake. The media is fake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=415.6s	415.6	 I'm getting some late numbers. I'm getting some late numbers here, you guys. He's now at minus $1.59 to win Pennsylvania and they took every other number off the board. However, if you're a Biden person, Jason, the number is only 2.17 right now. So, wow, the polls are posters were miles off on this. And this is just amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=442.1s	442.1	 And it seems like from what we're hearing from the reporting is that the pollsters did not understand the Latin or I guess Latin X is a way to describe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=453.2s	453.2	 a group of people who actually don't think exactly the same. I've always had a weird understanding of this term Latin X, which seems to come from the woke left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=463.1s	463.1	 Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans. These are different countries. They're not all the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=469.9s	469.9	 Venezuelans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=471.0s	471.0	 Venezuelans. This is not a monoculture just because they all speak the same language. And we're seeing something very different happen in Florida right now. We're male Cubans maybe are voting very differently than what pollsters expected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=486.2s	486.2	 Bestie Chamath is now fresh off a tight haircut and he's here on the pod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=490.5s	490.5	 Can you hear me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=491.4s	491.4	 We've got Bestie Phil as our first Bestie guestie of the night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=494.8s	494.8	 Bestie P, how are you Bestie P?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=497.9s	497.9	 Chamath, you and I, we shouldn't talk about this. This is about politics, but you and I were just filming high stakes poker in Las Vegas on Friday night. It was great to see you, Bestie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=508.5s	508.5	 Is there any indication you can give us besides? I mean, of course, there's a presidential election that is going to determine the future of humanity. But more importantly, how did you each do in the high stakes poker game?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=519.7s	519.7	 The biggest part of the night was around 400k, maybe 500k played between me and Durr.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=529.4s	529.4	 Durr?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=531.5s	531.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=532.2s	532.2	 And he won?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=533.9s	533.9	 He did not win that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=535.5s	535.5	 Oh my lord.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=536.8s	536.8	 Chamath won that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=538.3s	538.3	 Go Chamath, go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=540.1s	540.1	 And it was, I think it was beautifully played. I think Doug Polk will definitely do a short video clip on it. I did a very, very sneaky three bet preflop turn check river overbluff and got him to call.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=558.8s	558.8	 Oh my lord. A little set bomb, I'm guessing. But here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=564.1s	564.1	 Jason, I can't wait. Since I'm here to promote promote promote everything I promote. You can only watch these episodes of high stakes poker a lot of players favorite show. You can only watch them on the poker go app. They're coming out December 16. Meet Chamath, Phil Ivy, Tom Duan, Ben Lamb, a lot of your a lot of your heroes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=582.8s	582.8	 Take it away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=583.7s	583.7	 Can't wait can't wait to and I have a subscription to that all in. I'm sorry, the poker go app. It's well worth it. David Sachs, you have one of your friends on the pod. Why don't you introduce one of your consulting friends and we'll have him tee up what we think the possible scenarios are and where we're at right now at this very moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=606.8s	606.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=607.7s	607.7	 657 in California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=609.8s	609.8	 Yeah, so Michael Newman works for me as a researcher and he's a is a political scientist, I guess you could say, and I've known him since college and he's very steeped in these a lot of these races. I don't know if he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=624.6s	624.6	 Yeah, I have been obsessively following politics since the Reagan election of 1980. So I wasn't alive then. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=634.6s	634.6	 No, I'm afraid I'm I was only 10 but I was already a political obsessive and as you can imagine a real hit with the ladies as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=644.0s	644.0	 So tell us what, what are the key states we need to focus in on here and which one of them have enough reporting for us to sort of put them in a column and then move on and understand the path to victory for Trump or Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=661.7s	661.7	 Yes, well, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=663.9s	663.9	 Depending upon which network or news organization you're following. They're either calling calling a lot of states or they're being very conservative about their calls. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=672.5s	672.5	 NBC has still not called Florida for Trump, but there's really no path for Biden to win that state. So you can put that safely in the Trump column.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=681.7s	681.7	 He has just taken the lead in North Carolina after trailing all night. We got about 88% of the vote in now and I suspect he's home free as is the Republican incumbent senator there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=692.6s	692.6	 Can I, can I, can I just, can I just ask a question. I mean, isn't it typically the case that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=698.9s	698.9	 Counts from the most populous urban areas come last and those tend to skew more Democrat than Republican.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=707.8s	707.8	 That sometimes happens. It depends on the state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=713.4s	713.4	 Some states have their rural areas come in last. One of the things that has changed the vote in North Carolina is as the early vote came in as the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=722.4s	722.4	 In person early vote and mail in ballots came in the last counties that reported that early vote were the rural counties. That's why early on it looked very good for Biden and now it looks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=734.0s	734.0	 Like it's trending away from him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=736.8s	736.8	 Well, wait a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=737.9s	737.9	 North Carolina, according to the New York Times and according to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=742.8s	742.8	 CNN right now is favoring slightly Biden 49.7% to 49.1% for Trump with 84%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=752.6s	752.6	 I don't think that's, I don't think that's quite current. I think they're up to about 88%. But again, yeah, it's, it's very close. What's interesting is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=761.6s	761.6	 Biden had five potential states where he could have knocked Trump out Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=771.0s	771.0	 We don't know the reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=772.0s	772.0	 Florida is off the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=772.6s	772.6	 We don't. Yeah, Florida is off the table. The others are still on the table, but none of them are trending Biden's direction at the present time. So he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=782.0s	782.0	 So far Trump is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=785.2s	785.2	 Is staying in the hand as as you poker players would would say he's he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=791.3s	791.3	 He's getting the cards. He needs to stay in the to stay in the game. But we still have the river to play and the river would be in this case, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=800.6s	800.6	 Texas had an early lead for Biden, which was crazy to see right now. It's got Donald Trump at 50.3% Biden at 48.3%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=811.0s	811.0	 Guys, again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=811.5s	811.5	 So that's starting to normalize.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=813.1s	813.1	 I go back to this one very critical thing. The reason why Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania right now are Trump is because you count the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=821.9s	821.9	 When the county is counted, you can pass the votes and you can report and if you have 25,000 people in a county versus Allegheny County, which has like, I don't know, hundreds of thousands or a million plus people. It just takes longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=835.8s	835.8	 Yes. No, I listen. I don't characterize Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania at all. I think one of the reasons why Michigan right now looks so red is because they're counting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=846.5s	846.5	 Today's vote first a lot of these other states that like Florida that had the option because their legislature allows them to do this. They counted all that early vote in advance and they dumped it in one big pile.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=860.6s	860.6	 As soon as the polls closed in the in the various counties. So that's why you saw early on a blue mirage there. What you're seeing in a place like Michigan right now is probably a red mirage because it's it's today's vote, which was going to skew Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=878.0s	878.0	 Because of the because of the way he presented it to his people. He Florida was the one state, thank goodness for his sake that he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=885.7s	885.7	 Encouraged people to vote early and by mail in the other states. He encourages people to vote today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=891.7s	891.7	 Here's a here's a stat in Pennsylvania. I'm on the Secretary of State's reporting dashboard. They've counted only 12% of the mail in ballots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=903.8s	903.8	 Which is and the total mail in ballots is 2.5 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=907.8s	907.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=909.1s	909.1	 Which is huge. Right. And they've only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=910.6s	910.6	 It should be a majority of the vote, I would imagine. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=912.9s	912.9	 Yeah, and they've only and they've only counted 24% actually sorry, they've only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=919.0s	919.0	 Yeah, they've only counted a handful of precincts at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=925.0s	925.0	 A quarter of the precincts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=927.4s	927.4	 Right. So here's something I don't understand. So Nick Carlson from was it like Business Insider. He just tweeted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=936.2s	936.2	 Minutes ago that North Carolina Biden is ahead with 99% of the vote counted and Biden has a less than 0.2% lead but it's 9000 votes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=948.0s	948.0	 What I mean, that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=950.2s	950.2	 That would be a huge problem for Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=952.4s	952.4	 North Carolina. Listen, I think a loss in any of those five states, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio or Texas is probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=960.0s	960.0	 Shout out by the way, guys, I just want to give you a shout out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=962.6s	962.6	 He's listening. He just texted me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=964.7s	964.7	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=965.2s	965.2	 By the way, guys, right now the odds are three to one on the betting market. So I mean, obviously the networks I realized are completely useless. I stopped watching him a long time ago when they had Biden way ahead in Florida and the odds were 10 to one against right now if you want to bet Trump is a three to one favorite on and there's been billions of dollars bet in England, Australia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=982.2s	982.2	 All over the world. He's a three to one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=984.1s	984.1	 Well, it looks like it's real to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=986.6s	986.6	 And just to and just to just to build your side of the case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=990.9s	990.9	 Nasdaq futures ripping S&P futures falling and the 10 and 30 year falling remember be ripping. These are all pro Trump trades and the euro the euro collapse the euro dollar falling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1001.8s	1001.8	 Well, here's what they're reacting to is Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania Trump is all up big time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1007.1s	1007.1	 Now, again, this that lacks a very basic understanding of how county reporting is happening in these highly populist, you know, or these sort of sorry, these these bimodalism is not happening in the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1019.5s	1019.5	 Experimentally distributed states where they have a bunch of suburban and rural vote that's fast account and the big places for example, like you know, you're not going to see Milwaukee and Green Bay report until probably close to midnight so the question is why are the betting market so pro trump?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1034.3s	1034.3	 Then what do they know that we don't know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1036.1s	1036.1	 I will say this, let me say this, Jason. I mean, if you're like, there, you're talking about billions of dollars, right? And so all you had to do is design a system to figure out how to calculate votes earlier and make a couple hundred million dollars. Okay, these are the smartest people in the world. There's no one more smart than you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1054.6s	1054.6	 There's hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars at stake. They obviously do it 10 times better than any other site than in the other network. So this information, I mean, I give a friend of mine posted, hey, I'm laying two to one on on Twitter guys on buying my other friend bet $400,000 to $800,000. So I'm going to do a $100,000 bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1073.9s	1073.9	 So this information, I mean, I give a friend of mine posted, hey, I'm laying two to one on on Twitter guys on buying my other friend bet $400,000 to $800,000 Trump and now he looks like a genius. Somebody knows something that we don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1090.0s	1090.0	 Well, Trump just on Bovada Trump just moved to minus 600.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1094.0s	1094.0	 Yeah, he just took Michigan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1095.4s	1095.4	 Unbelievable minus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1097.4s	1097.4	 like he's a it looks like he's ahead in Michigan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1099.3s	1099.3	 But again, we have to see Detroit. And there's there's a bunch of places in Michigan. Let's, let's, let's, let's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1107.0s	1107.0	 bathe in the north. So here's the North Carolina Secretary of State dashboard. And they're showing two thirds of the county then you can actually see by county when you go into their dashboard. The, you know, tomorrow, the larger counties are partially reported. Most of the smaller counties are fully reported.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1127.0s	1127.0	 63% total with, you know, Biden ahead by literally 1000 votes right now, across 2.5 to 2 million to 2.5 to 1 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1138.2s	1138.2	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1140.7s	1140.7	 But what percent reported is that? I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1143.2s	1143.2	 it's 63% of the counties have completely reported. And so the remaining counties, if you look at the reporting status, the remaining counties that are partially reported, there's a mix of rural and some of the urban counties, you know, Durham's in there partially reported. So there is a mix. It's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1163.4s	1163.4	 Durham should be a Biden County. The research triangle is upscale, well educated professionals, that I think are the the backbone of the Democrats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1173.8s	1173.8	 coalition in a state like North Carolina.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1177.5s	1177.5	 Now they have absentee votes that are counted. And they have so far counted 3.3 million absentee one stop votes and a million votes by mail. But that's how many came in. It actually shows that only five. I see. Yeah, okay. That makes sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1198.2s	1198.2	 Trump is now ahead in Ohio by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1200.4s	1200.4	 two thirds of the votes were post the link into the zoom chat so Nick can pull it up on the screen, please. I need to get an understanding of something very basic here for the audience who's not degenerate gamblers are Is there a chance here, Phil and Chamath gambling experts both that people had put early money on Biden and are now covering or hedging some of those bats? Is that a possibility here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1227.6s	1227.6	 Yes. Okay, Jason, Jason, the line is minus $1 minus 410 on Pinnacle right now. Let me just double check that source. So what Phil is saying, Jason is like, yes, there's going to be a bunch of essentially covering. Now that covering will swing the line. But I think what Phil is also saying is when a line moves this violently, literally what we've seen in the last 35 minutes, is both the equity markets, the currency markets, and the betting markets flip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1256.9s	1256.9	 180 degrees from where they have been not just all day, but frankly, where they had been probably for the last few months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1265.9s	1265.9	 That's what I was saying, Chamath, for three months straight, right now, Biden has been a favorite anywhere between three to one favorite at one point, all the way to maybe, you know, 50% favorite. And all of a sudden today, the lowest I saw was $1.35. And I was kind of shocked. And the next thing you know, boom, Trump's a three to four to one favorite. So and I'm looking at CNN, and I'm looking at these networks, and they're still they still have Biden ahead. And I'm like, wow, what is going on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1294.2s	1294.2	 They're way behind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1295.0s	1295.0	 That's, that's the next thing we need to take care of, Chamath. There's a business for you is somehow we can deliver the right data on elections quickly. There you go, Saxon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1304.9s	1304.9	 Yeah, well, I think the betting markets know something we don't know. Because Trump is just, you know, if you look at like the live stream on Twitter, the New York Times or something, Trump just slightly took the lead in Ohio. But that's the state he's supposed to win in North Carolina, it looks like with over 99% reporting, it looks like he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1323.9s	1323.9	 lost by 9000 votes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1325.4s	1325.4	 By the way, a 9000 vote margin would probably trigger an automatic recount of North Carolina.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1330.8s	1330.8	 And there's like 100 1000 absentee ballots there. I don't know if those have been counted yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1335.9s	1335.9	 Okay, so let's pause for one second on this, everybody. North Carolina is one of the four or five states Trump has to win in order to have a victory. Right, Michael?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1346.2s	1346.2	 I absolutely agree with that. He had to have those five Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, Ohio and Texas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1351.6s	1351.6	 Okay, so we have Florida he's got now there's four left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1355.4s	1355.4	 There's four left. George is a very slow counting state. We really don't know. All of Atlanta could be out for all we know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1361.3s	1361.3	 But we leave Georgia on the side. So now we got four states we can work with. North Carolina is in Biden's pocket by just a hair. Yeah, that could change. And it would trigger a recount, which would take days to weeks. Yes. Now there are three states. Let's go through them systematically one by one, Michael.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1380.8s	1380.8	 Okay, Ohio was the biggest surprise of the night when Biden built an early lead there, although again, a bit of a blue mirage based upon the fact that the mail in vote and the early vote came in so strong for the Democrats this year, because they emphasized it and the Republicans kind of fought against it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1400.4s	1400.4	 Michael, Michael with 49% of the vote in Ohio. Okay, he had a right now Biden had a massive lead and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1407.0s	1407.0	 About a 400,000 vote lead would have to correct and we look at the betting odds he was five to one underdog to win the state. So something doesn't add up there and you can you can say all right, some of that is all the early voting went for Biden, we know that to be a fact. But there's something else there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1422.0s	1422.0	 Okay, I'm just looking at the results for Ohio will stay on Ohio for one more moment. And then we have another guest who just jumped on Ohio is currently showing Donald Trump with two point rounding it up 2.4 million votes to 2.2 million slightly rounding up for Joe Biden 52% to 47% with 78% reporting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1447.5s	1447.5	 Does that mean we feel comfortable with Trump winning Ohio and less all of Cleveland is outstanding, I would say that's a Trump state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1458.8s	1458.8	 Okay, we now have john Cohen online. John is a member of the survey monkey team john welcome to the all in pod. Can you hear us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1468.8s	1468.8	 Thank you so much. I'm sorry I didn't hear what was going on. I don't I don't know how much you've been disparaging pollsters so far. So,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1475.6s	1475.6	 we know we were waiting for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1477.6s	1477.6	 We're waiting to get here. Tell us as we start what your prediction was earlier today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1485.2s	1485.2	 Well, we're very clear to say that we're doing measurements, not predictions. Okay, that said, the measurements that we are doing clearly pointed to Biden advantages across the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1495.0s	1495.0	 But we didn't have we so far we have no surprises. You know, we had Florida had been Trump plus two basically all week going to dead even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1503.7s	1503.7	 You know, coming into the election day itself. We don't know where the final votes will be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1508.5s	1508.5	 Most analysts think that it's in Trump's camp. It may end up there, but it's super close. We had Georgia close. We had North Carolina close
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1515.6s	1515.6	 Although and North Carolina had been closing it had been a big Biden lead it was down to under two points
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1520.7s	1520.7	 With the Senate, you know, kind of even closer than that in some of our data. So, you know, so far, there's no obvious surprise here like damn the polls were really wrong. Certainly ours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1530.3s	1530.3	 You know, it's our it's early though. We're not declaring victory on those. Obviously, there's a lot to watch, but nothing really to surprise, you know, us given the numbers so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1539.0s	1539.0	 What about Ohio and Georgia?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1541.4s	1541.4	 So we had Ohio pretty consistently in Trump's camp. We had him up for so it's trending that way. Now we had it as close as two points for Trump. I mean, again, I haven't mentioned the word margin of error. That's in my professional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1553.4s	1553.4	 Obligation and duty dimension. It is around three points, I believe, two and a half in Ohio so close, but we always had it in Trump's camp again, Biden that wasn't part of Biden's, you know, any of the past victory that they campaign was counting on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1566.6s	1566.6	 So, you know, no big deal, but we went from having an early night to now we're sure for sure in for a really late night here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1575.0s	1575.0	 John, let me ask you the one of the most basic questions that I've had, which is what did we learn from 2016 and tell me what exactly did people try to fix like what was the thing that everybody got wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1589.0s	1589.0	 And what changed?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1590.2s	1590.2	 Well, the biggest thing that polls fixed was how they adjust their polls by education.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1595.3s	1595.3	 What we see in polling, no matter how they're conducted, whether online as we do a survey monkey, or still on the telephone, which most media pollsters do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1602.3s	1602.3	 Is you get people who with more formal education to answer those surveys in far greater proportions than you do people with lower education.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1610.0s	1610.0	 So the biggest thing you got to do and look, we always did it. So we weren't in the among the state pollsters who kind of failed, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1617.4s	1617.4	 You know, kind of negligently to adjust by education at all. We always had to adjust by education, but we what we failed to notice in 2016
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1626.3s	1626.3	 Was there was an increasing gap between those with postgraduate degrees and those of BAS. They've always been both to pro democratic group, but the gap in 2016 was abnormally large.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1637.2s	1637.2	 A fix to our polls, which I just point out weren't, you know, kind of were actually standouts in the in the upper Midwest in terms of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1643.8s	1643.8	 Showing it as a close race, not clear Clinton victories. We broke apart post grads and grads into two distinct categories and that released kind of about a point and a half of unforced air.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1654.4s	1654.4	 In our polling for 2016 so that's fixed. We've used it to good effect. Again, this time around. We weren't showing what all the other national polls are showing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1662.6s	1662.6	 We've had this between a four and six point nationally again, we'll get quickly into why national results don't matter. But you all know that all too well. Everyone knows that all too well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1671.1s	1671.1	 But we've had it kind of more narrow and that plays out in the states that I mentioned we had Florida tied not a four point Biden five point by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1678.6s	1678.6	 Advantage elsewhere, you know, but we'll see how it plays out in the Midwest. We also had Wisconsin was our final margin there. I think it was, you know, kind of nine and nine and a half points, not the 17 points that you saw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1689.3s	1689.3	 From my former colleagues at the Washington Post ABC News. So we've always had it a little bit tighter. But again, it plays house going to play out in the states and so far, no surprises. But then I just early and I'm I have a healthy dose of pulses paranoia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1701.3s	1701.3	 Jamal, I don't know if that answer your question well enough, but that was the main thing people did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1705.2s	1705.2	 It's really helpful. But now take off your pollster measure, you know, chief research officer hat for a second and put on just the American hat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1715.7s	1715.7	 What does it mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1718.0s	1718.0	 When you know we had effectively a repudiation of the establishment in 2016
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1723.8s	1723.8	 And despite everything that's happened over the last four years, we may be on the brink of another repudiation again if you, you know, where you're there to measure the pulse of what's going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1734.7s	1734.7	 But less in sort of measurement speak and just more in just plain American English speak, john what like what's going on. If this happens again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1744.4s	1744.4	 See, you're absolutely right. There's something major. I would also like to caveat it. We are looking once again at if Trump wins. It's because of the Electoral College.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1753.1s	1753.1	 Like he is going to lose the popular vote. There's still far more Americans and American voters who voted today and you know kind of over the past several weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1762.2s	1762.2	 Who would prefer Joe Biden to be president. So again, we can't characterize with a broad brush the American voting population.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1769.3s	1769.3	 When this is about effectively. I hate to call it a quirk, but this is about our system of vote tallying and the president, you know, but to pull back your point about kind of there is something major here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1780.8s	1780.8	 The fact that many people, you know, some of us might be friends with can understand why this isn't 100 to zero race failed to understand that the president's base isn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1790.3s	1790.3	 Small it is, you know, we've had it 44 to 46% approving of his job performance for many years now. Like he has a completely durable solid floor. He also has a high ceiling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1803.0s	1803.0	 Right. So he was never going to win the popular vote this time around, but he had a chance at that electoral squeaking out another Electoral College win because he's been so stable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1811.3s	1811.3	 You know, this is a president who, you know, kind of up Trump now head and NC. Thank you for the chat window. So I think you're right that we need to understand more about what is the component tree of that 45% that they would support Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1824.6s	1824.6	 When the other 55% are so dead set against him and see it as something really wrong with the country. So we saw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1833.1s	1833.1	 No, what have you guys done to though understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1836.4s	1836.4	 The people that are voting for Trump better because I think that they are protesting and they're protesting a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1844.8s	1844.8	 And I think that, you know, if we didn't listen to them in 16 I think it's almost criminal to not listen to them in 2020 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1854.1s	1854.1	 What are they, what are they saying? What are they rejecting or what is it that they want? Because at the end of the day, you know, I think his incompetence can't really be debated competence versus competence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1865.5s	1865.5	 I think what we can debate is he's a vessel and in that I think that it's incredibly important what's happening, irrespective of what happens today because we were supposed to walk into a landslide. We're not as you said, we're going to be in a nail biter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1878.4s	1878.4	 What is what are what are they using him as a vessel to communicate to everybody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1883.4s	1883.4	 That's a really good question. I mean, some of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1885.8s	1885.8	 That will depend on, you know, a closer analysis of the surveys ours where we talked to more than a million voters and the exit polls that are being conducted by two separate organizations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1894.0s	1894.0	 What's the what are the storylines that come out of the election. You know, one of the things that's being reported early is there's a much tighter Hispanic vote in Florida.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1900.8s	1900.8	 Than many early polls, you know, predicted. How will that play out as we start to get votes, you know, coming out in Texas. How does it be in Arizona. Arizona looking positively for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1910.0s	1910.0	 Biden and Mark Kelly in the Senate, you know, in Arizona. You know, is it is it really Hispanic votes that are driving some Trump strength in these states.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1918.7s	1918.7	 Or you kind of is it the obsession that the news media has had for the past four years around the kind of Trump middle aged white male voter with less than college education who has been displaced by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1931.6s	1931.6	 You know, technological and industrial trends over the past 20 years. I think it's going to depend on what that voting coalition looks like for Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1938.2s	1938.2	 And it's more diverse than I think we've been focusing on for four years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1941.2s	1941.2	 I think you're saying an incredibly important thing. I think that that was a ruse and I've always thought that that was bullshit. It's not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1947.8s	1947.8	 It's not some under educated Rube that's running around voting for this guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1953.0s	1953.0	 I think that there are there are people up and down the the age spectrum, the socioeconomic spectrum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1959.4s	1959.4	 And this is what I mean by he has become a vessel for so many different messages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1965.5s	1965.5	 And I think we really have to start figuring out what the hell these messages actually mean because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1971.7s	1971.7	 If Biden loses to your point, maybe in Florida, it's a repudiation of socialism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1977.0s	1977.0	 Okay, but in Pennsylvania, it's going to be something else in Michigan. It's going to be something else in Ohio. It's going to be something else for him to keep winning. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=1985.4s	1985.4	 And and I just don't think that there's a consistent idea. And it's very dismissive to say that I'm not saying you are, but I'm saying, you know, that idea that it was an out of work ex factory worker, you know, in rural Ohio that was protesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2000.4s	2000.4	 This is going to be much bigger than that, because even if Biden wins the popular vote, until we figure out how to rebounce balance the electoral college in a completely, you know, new way or just get rid of it altogether.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2014.7s	2014.7	 We're going to have to live with understanding how some folks in these extremely pivotal states are pushing back. Are they pushing back on political correctness?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2025.2s	2025.2	 You know, that's one thing that I've always thought. I think that there's a huge vote here against cancel culture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2033.3s	2033.3	 So all of that stuff. Absolutely. Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2035.8s	2035.8	 And lockdowns. I think those are the under reported. Lockdowns are the, I think the biggest, one of the biggest drivers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2043.2s	2043.2	 No, go ahead, John. Go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2045.3s	2045.3	 I was going to say one of the components here that we have to pay a lot of attention to is gender.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2048.7s	2048.7	 Right. Kind of the storyline for a long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2051.9s	2051.9	 And we think about, you know, kind of Republican, Democratic politics is that, you know, we talk about black voters and Hispanic voters talking about them as if they're monoliths.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2059.4s	2059.4	 What we have seen consistently over the course of the year is that Trump does much better among black men and Hispanic men than he does among black women and Latinas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2070.9s	2070.9	 And that is just kind of like, you know, whereas black women are 95-5, you know, he nears 20% among black men.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2077.4s	2077.4	 It blends into what we've, the 90-10.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2080.5s	2080.5	 Look, but these are measurements. These are measurements. I don't think they're telling you the whys of anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2086.6s	2086.6	 And I think for the whys, you have to go a lot deeper. I mean, first of all, let's talk about the lockdown issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2092.6s	2092.6	 Can we just pull up that tweet, Nick? I mean, so this is what I said back in May.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2098.9s	2098.9	 This was like months ago before the election even hit, you know, which is if the woke left insists on permanent lockdowns, Trump will have an issue that supersedes the incompetence of COVID response.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2109.1s	2109.1	 Because I think, you know, we all we all agree on that, which is whether our lives and livelihoods belong to politicians to meet or out in dribs and drabs as they see fit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2118.0s	2118.0	 And this was back when Elon was being shut out of his factory in Fremont.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2123.5s	2123.5	 And then there was this hairdresser named Shirley Luther in Texas who was basically put on trial for opening up her hair salon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2134.1s	2134.1	 And the judge wanted her to grovel and beg for forgiveness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2138.6s	2138.6	 And this was the beginning of the rebellion over lockdowns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2141.9s	2141.9	 And it was so obvious back then that lockdowns weren't going to fly. They weren't sustainable. They were too politically unpopular.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2149.8s	2149.8	 They weren't going to work. And by the way, if it was something a cause that the left agreed with, like, you know, a BLM rally or something like that, then you were allowed to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2158.9s	2158.9	 You know, it was that whole standard around, you know, doing things that were essential.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2164.9s	2164.9	 And so, you know, this insistence on lockdowns, even after the public had really repudiated them, I think was a major issue for Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2174.5s	2174.5	 And it was crazy to me that Biden was still insisting on lockdowns, you know, still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2180.7s	2180.7	 I mean, that is his official position. I don't think it's the only reason why he's in trouble right now, but I think it's a big one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2187.5s	2187.5	 I think if he if Trump reaches the blue wall again of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, lockdowns is the biggest reason why, because those are three states that had extensive and still have extensive lockdowns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2200.2s	2200.2	 It hurts people. Here, I'll read you a tweet and I won't name who it's from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2204.7s	2204.7	 It's from a farmer in in the Corn Belt who's well followed on Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2210.4s	2210.4	 Believe it or not, there's a whole ag Twitter community.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2214.1s	2214.1	 And he says, well, it's the day. Does this country turn down the road to be like Venezuela or do we continue on the road of capitalism?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2221.1s	2221.1	 And he's had this acute feeling that he's kind of vocalized on Twitter for months now on how painful the lockdowns have been on him and his family and his business and on the community.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2234.1s	2234.1	 And it just feels like overreach to a lot of people that the recognition that the left might be using to justify the decision is just not there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2243.6s	2243.6	 That the impact, the near term impact that folks are feeling is what's there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2247.3s	2247.3	 And that's driving a lot of behavior right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2249.2s	2249.2	 Boys, all markets are now up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2252.0s	2252.0	 Everything is green. Dow futures, S&P 500 futures, Nasdaq futures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2257.4s	2257.4	 Oil is up. Gold is down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2259.6s	2259.6	 And there were some guys that made some heavy bets against the dollar going into this thinking we were going to have massive inflation with Biden policy coming up and some big fund managers that went really big on shorting the dollar this last week and the dollar is up right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2274.2s	2274.2	 Yeah, the dollar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2275.4s	2275.4	 By the way, we should we should make sure at some point tonight to talk about these very important Senate races, because it's not just Trump versus Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2283.0s	2283.0	 There's also a bunch of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2285.9s	2285.9	 Hickenlooper won in Colorado.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2287.4s	2287.4	 Hickenlooper won in Colorado.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2289.2s	2289.2	 But there have been some, you know, some of the Republicans who look to be in big trouble like Lindsey Graham have have pulled it out and have won.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2296.4s	2296.4	 And so it's looking like the Senate is still very much in play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2301.2s	2301.2	 I would say as big a favorite as Biden was the Senate shifting from Republican to Democrat, I'd say that was considered as equally big a favorite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2312.4s	2312.4	 And that that may not happen now, so we should make sure to talk about that at some point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2316.3s	2316.3	 North Carolina right now is forty nine point eight percent to forty nine percent for Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2322.2s	2322.2	 Two point six million versus two point five eight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2325.1s	2325.1	 Ohio is at two point four to two point two fifty one fifty two percent forty seven percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2331.9s	2331.9	 Trump is beating Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2333.8s	2333.8	 I have a question for John Cohen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2335.9s	2335.9	 John, let's go back to sort of your understanding as you've been measuring different trends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2342.0s	2342.0	 Have you measured people's sympathy towards lockdowns on a state by state level?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2350.0s	2350.0	 And then second question is, have you measured people's sympathy to cancel culture at a state by state level?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2357.2s	2357.2	 And by the way, you're on mute. So if you want to just take yourself off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2359.8s	2359.8	 Yeah, thank you. We have not done anything on cancel culture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2363.7s	2363.7	 We've done a lot on the coronavirus. We've been tracking that actually in three countries since mid February.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2368.9s	2368.9	 And we have a state by state look. And what's interesting is we ask the question, like, is this primarily an economic issue or a primary health issue?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2376.2s	2376.2	 And those two have been running neck and neck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2378.7s	2378.7	 But health and kind of more people on average say it's a health issue than an economic one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2384.0s	2384.0	 With Trump supporters overwhelmingly say the crisis is one that's financial, not health related.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2388.6s	2388.6	 So there's always been that. But it's been like a forty five, fifty five gap there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2393.1s	2393.1	 So we've been measuring it state by state, but there's a solid core of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2396.4s	2396.4	 And it gets to David's point about why. What are they focused on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2399.6s	2399.6	 What is the what is affecting them and their pocketbooks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2402.9s	2402.9	 It is the lockdowns and the kind of clamping down and what is this economic crisis?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2408.7s	2408.7	 Not a health care one, even though that's what we all say that they should follow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2412.7s	2412.7	 There was a there is a there is a fantastic line that the Democrats coined, which essentially said something to the tune Saxie Poo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2419.6s	2419.6	 You'll tell me if I get this wrong. But it was socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the for the rest of us is essentially sort of their grab bag phrase for for this election cycle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2432.8s	2432.8	 And sort of to frame a lot of policies. But when you have in these states, again, if we say this cuts along socioeconomic lines, but then maybe bleeds into college and even graduate level educated folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2448.9s	2448.9	 Is there a vote here for rugged individualism and just leave me the fuck alone?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2456.0s	2456.0	 There certainly could be. I want to go back to what David said about measuring versus the why, because I mentioned gender to point out a big difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2462.6s	2462.6	 That we're seeing across racial groups across the levels of education.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2466.5s	2466.5	 But I'm you know, we're we're polling every day. So you guys have the right why question?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2470.5s	2470.5	 You know, send it to me. You know, send to Xander.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2473.1s	2473.1	 Well, we'll ask it. You know, we pulled nine thousand people today on, you know, kind of their willingness to accept the results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2478.8s	2478.8	 And so we'll be putting that out tomorrow. We have a we'll have an exit poll running every day from here on to certainly till we get a result.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2486.2s	2486.2	 So you have the question you want to ask? Send along.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2488.9s	2488.9	 Well, we'll get you the data at the state level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2491.6s	2491.6	 All right, John, we very much appreciate you coming on the pod and we will be checking SurveyMonkey's amazing data as we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2499.8s	2499.8	 I'm going to switch now and just John John.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2502.2s	2502.2	 John, thank you. And Xander, thanks for doing for hooking that up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2505.3s	2505.3	 Thanks, John. Thanks, guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2506.4s	2506.4	 You and we'll have some more bestie guesties coming up, some fan favorites from the Twitter and the poker group.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2512.2s	2512.2	 I just want to point out right now that it's very interesting to see that Fox has Biden at one hundred twenty nine electoral votes and Trump at one hundred nine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2523.2s	2523.2	 And some of the other networks have it much lower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2528.7s	2528.7	 How do the networks make these decisions of when to call a state?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2535.4s	2535.4	 Because it's too early, according to many to call Florida, but we're sitting here with a pretty clear understanding of where Florida is at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2543.7s	2543.7	 Does anybody have any thoughts on that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2545.4s	2545.4	 Well, I think they're erring on the side of extreme caution because of the strange year that it is and the fact that there is all this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2554.8s	2554.8	 We had a hundred over a hundred million votes banked early through the mail or through early in-person voting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2560.9s	2560.9	 And nobody sure how many more mail ballots there, according to one side, I looked at there were still twenty seven million ballots outstanding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2568.4s	2568.4	 Now, some of those are redundant ballots like David's father-in-law, who got three ballots in the mail in Pennsylvania.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2575.2s	2575.2	 And a lot of those are probably going in the trash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2577.3s	2577.3	 But there could be another five to 10 million of those to come in that are postmarked by today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2582.3s	2582.3	 Many states will accept them after the election, as long as they're postmarked by Election Day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2587.3s	2587.3	 So they're probably being very, very careful that they don't make a premature call.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2591.8s	2591.8	 Of course, they all have PTSD about what happened in 2000 when they first prematurely called Florida for Al Gore,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2598.5s	2598.5	 then prematurely called it for George W. Bush.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2601.2s	2601.2	 And we spent the next 37 days trying to figure out what the hell happened in Florida.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2605.1s	2605.1	 So I think they're going to err on the side of extreme caution across the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2610.2s	2610.2	 Although I feel like the margin in Florida at this point is insurmountable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2615.1s	2615.1	 It's insurmountable now, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2616.6s	2616.6	 Florida is over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2618.5s	2618.5	 Florida is over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2619.4s	2619.4	 It's about now it's about all in its Ohio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2622.8s	2622.8	 By the way, the betting markets have just moved again big time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2625.9s	2625.9	 So Donald Trump was at minus 600.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2628.0s	2628.0	 Now he's minus 250 on Pavado.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2630.2s	2630.2	 Phil, what do you think about that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2631.8s	2631.8	 Yeah, snapping back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2633.1s	2633.1	 I will say, let me let me address what Jake Jason was talking about a few seconds ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2637.5s	2637.5	 And that's it. You know, basically, Florida, even the New York Times had them at at 6 p.m.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2643.9s	2643.9	 at 95 percent to go to Trump at 95 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2647.9s	2647.9	 That was a New York Times site.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2648.8s	2648.8	 My wife and I looked it up and the betting odds had them at over 10 to one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2652.7s	2652.7	 This was at 530.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2654.0s	2654.0	 This was two hours ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2655.0s	2655.0	 So, I mean, I just think there's a huge inefficiency with with the way that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2658.6s	2658.6	 I think it was over as soon as the Miami Day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2660.8s	2660.8	 dump showed that Biden only won the early vote by nine points.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2664.0s	2664.0	 I mean, Hillary won it by 29 in 2016 and she lost the state. So.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2671.0s	2671.0	 How much of this do we think has to do with tax policy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2675.6s	2675.6	 People in Florida are retiring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2678.0s	2678.0	 We have the AOC gang.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2681.0s	2681.0	 We have Elizabeth Warren.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2684.1s	2684.1	 It's his beloved state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2685.6s	2685.6	 He has a place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2686.9s	2686.9	 OK, so so hometown favorite Morillago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2689.7s	2689.7	 I get that. But you have so many retirees and we have this bifurcation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2695.3s	2695.3	 of how taxes should work in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2697.5s	2697.5	 So I just want to open that up for the entire group to discuss of art.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2701.2s	2701.2	 Are we seeing old people?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2703.0s	2703.0	 Are we seeing people who are concerned about taxes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2706.8s	2706.8	 Because we have had a flight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2709.1s	2709.1	 in the last couple of years of people from high tax states to low tax states.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2713.8s	2713.8	 Is this about taxes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2715.4s	2715.4	 Do you think? Let's start with you, Friedberg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2718.3s	2718.3	 No one wants to pay taxes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2719.8s	2719.8	 The fuck? I mean, like no one's going to raise their hand and say, I want to be taxed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2722.9s	2722.9	 But I mean, there's a moment where taxes don't matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2729.0s	2729.0	 Well, but Romney Romney Romney was in favor of taxes and he,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2735.0s	2735.0	 you know, he didn't win any any of these elections
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2739.4s	2739.4	 like the way that Trump looks like he's going to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2741.8s	2741.8	 I think that the traditional Republican messages,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2745.5s	2745.5	 message of taxes is sort of necessary, but not sufficient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2750.0s	2750.0	 Trump obviously brought a whole set of issues that previous Republicans hadn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2757.1s	2757.1	 hadn't brought. And I think that I think you have to look at 2016
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2761.4s	2761.4	 separately from 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2763.4s	2763.4	 And so starting with 2016, I think the big issue that Trump,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2768.2s	2768.2	 that no Republican really had ever figured out, except maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2771.6s	2771.6	 Pat Buchanan 20 years ago, was the trade issue with China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2775.5s	2775.5	 You know, we forget that in the 1970s,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2779.4s	2779.4	 when the great Chinese economic reformer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2781.9s	2781.9	 Deng Xiaoping, decided to open up the Chinese economy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2784.9s	2784.9	 the average Chinese was making two dollars a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2787.6s	2787.6	 And today their economy is roughly the size of the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2790.7s	2790.7	 Now, you know, what was the reason for that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2793.0s	2793.0	 Well, we had a bipartisan consensus in this country for 30 or 40 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2797.8s	2797.8	 on the part of both Clintons and both Bush's that we should, you know, open them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2802.5s	2802.5	 We should welcome them with open arms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2804.1s	2804.1	 And we opened up our market to Chinese products.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2806.6s	2806.6	 We brought them into the World Trade Organization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2810.0s	2810.0	 But that was the start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2811.2s	2811.2	 That was the start of that was the the killer app or the killer issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2815.6s	2815.6	 that Trump figured out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2816.6s	2816.6	 And that's what shattered the blue firewall in those Rust Belt states.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2820.9s	2820.9	 I mean, if you're going to try and figure out going back to 2016
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2823.7s	2823.7	 why Trump won, you have to explain why he won.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2826.6s	2826.6	 Michigan was saying our jobs. They took our jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2830.4s	2830.4	 But what I'm saying is the manufacturing jobs went out and the fentanyl came in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2834.0s	2834.0	 I mean, that's his argument.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2835.5s	2835.5	 And that was a killer argument.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2837.8s	2837.8	 I mean, and the proof is in the pudding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2839.2s	2839.2	 And so the proof is that he won these states that Hillary thought were so in the bag
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2843.7s	2843.7	 that she didn't even bother to campaign there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2846.5s	2846.5	 That was the big surprise at 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2849.4s	2849.4	 And the issue of taxes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2851.4s	2851.4	 Well, no, no, no, no, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2852.8s	2852.8	 Let me explain what's going on in 2020, in my opinion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2855.8s	2855.8	 OK, this is not a partisan explanation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2857.5s	2857.5	 But I think that after the loss in 2016, look, in business,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2863.2s	2863.2	 we know that when you lose it, when you make a mistake,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2866.4s	2866.4	 you make a bad investment or the company does something wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2869.1s	2869.1	 You analyze what you did wrong. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2871.5s	2871.5	 And then you figure out what changes to make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2873.5s	2873.5	 The Democrat Party did not do that. What do they do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2876.5s	2876.5	 They blame Facebook.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2877.9s	2877.9	 They blamed it on Russian interference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2879.9s	2879.9	 They never really analyze why they lost these Rust Belt states and made changes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2885.1s	2885.1	 Instead, what they began was this hysterical denunciation of Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2890.4s	2890.4	 You had this sort of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2892.5s	2892.5	 you know, you sort of had this sort of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2896.2s	2896.2	 you know, media, culture, tech, industrial complex
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2902.0s	2902.0	 who decided that Trump was an illegitimate president.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2905.7s	2905.7	 And, you know, and so what they did is they went all in on impeachment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2909.3s	2909.3	 They went all in on this Russia stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2911.5s	2911.5	 And in the process, they created this enormous backlash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2914.8s	2914.8	 And I think that 2020, if 2016 was an economic repudiation of the elites,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2920.2s	2920.2	 2020 is a cultural repudiation of the elites.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2923.7s	2923.7	 That is the big issue in 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2925.6s	2925.6	 Yeah, I tend to I tend to I'm sympathetic to David's view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2929.8s	2929.8	 I don't completely agree with all of it, but just to build on something you said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2934.6s	2934.6	 I don't think, Jason, this has anything to do with taxes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2938.5s	2938.5	 I think that in Florida, the if we if we end up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2943.0s	2943.0	 really getting to the bottom of what happened, I think there's a lot of people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2948.0s	2948.0	 older people that probably lived through some version of McCarthyism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2951.8s	2951.8	 and immigrants who actually fled really shitty totalitarian countries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2955.9s	2955.9	 who were like, you want to do what here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2960.0s	2960.0	 And I think that there was a lot of people that basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2963.4s	2963.4	 are giving a very clear signal, which is I am a Democrat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2967.2s	2967.2	 But if you push me to the brink and talk about a socialized nanny state,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2970.5s	2970.5	 I'm going to vote Republican.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2972.1s	2972.1	 So to David's point, I totally agree to David's point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2975.4s	2975.4	 If there was an economic repudiation of sort of traditional globalism in 2016
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2982.7s	2982.7	 and Donald Trump ends up carrying the day and today, then it's a repudiation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2987.4s	2987.4	 of sort of these cultural manifestos and norms that we're swinging to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2993.2s	2993.2	 Now, the answer to that may be to say, change the electoral college
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=2998.2s	2998.2	 because it doesn't represent the majority or the plurality of Americans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3003.0s	3003.0	 I hear that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3004.2s	3004.2	 But in the same way that, you know, we've said for years now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3006.9s	3006.9	 that the Republicans will have to change to win the electoral college
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3009.8s	3009.8	 or to change to win what's evolving in terms of people's perceptions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3015.0s	3015.0	 on social policy, it may actually be the Democrats that also have to change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3020.2s	3020.2	 if this doesn't swing hard back in Biden's favor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3023.7s	3023.7	 So and Chamath, when you when you made that statement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3027.4s	3027.4	 I think what's particularly prescient is the Democrats believed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3031.9s	3031.9	 that because of the demographic shift from white Americans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3036.0s	3036.0	 to people of color, Latinos, black Americans, that they were just going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3040.4s	3040.4	 to win all of this is this is the they assume that if you were.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3044.0s	3044.0	 This is the problem with the stupidity of the establishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3047.6s	3047.6	 Like if you take a thousand brown people and put us in a room,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3052.8s	3052.8	 what I will tell you is just in case here's a fucking memo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3055.5s	3055.5	 for all you white people out there, we're not all the goddamn same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3058.4s	3058.4	 OK, and if you put a thousand black people, here's the memo now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3062.8s	3062.8	 for the Democrats and the Republicans, they're not all the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3066.8s	3066.8	 You can take a thousand Hispanics and it turns out they're not all the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3070.8s	3070.8	 So maybe, you know, you can take a thousand straight people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3074.5s	3074.5	 a thousand gay people there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3076.3s	3076.3	 We're not all the fucking same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3078.4s	3078.4	 So maybe what this means is that we've moved past color and now ideology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3083.1s	3083.1	 and social policy and economic and monetary and fiscal, all of these things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3087.5s	3087.5	 The totality of how a rational, well-developed person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3093.5s	3093.5	 makes a decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3094.5s	3094.5	 Maybe that's at hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3095.6s	3095.6	 And before, if we historically only thought, you know, older white men
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3099.2s	3099.2	 and white women could do it, maybe now it actually applies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3101.5s	3101.5	 independent of color and gender.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3103.6s	3103.6	 Yeah, I absolutely agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3105.1s	3105.1	 And I would add to that that if Trump's victory in 2016
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3110.0s	3110.0	 laid waste to the Republican establishment, if he wins again tonight,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3113.2s	3113.2	 it will lay waste to the Democratic establishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3115.2s	3115.2	 And the theory of the case that they've had for 20 years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3117.6s	3117.6	 the sort of chair, emerging Democratic majority case
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3122.6s	3122.6	 that they just had to sit back and let demography become destiny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3126.9s	3126.9	 And they could just graft an identity politics onto the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3131.9s	3131.9	 neoliberal economic agenda they've been pushing since the late 1980s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3135.6s	3135.6	 And it would all just somehow magically produce majority results in the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3140.3s	3140.3	 They are going to have to go back to the drawing board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3142.6s	3142.6	 And I think get more populist themselves and come up with some kind of version
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3147.6s	3147.6	 of politics that is more in the burning mold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3151.4s	3151.4	 It needs to be left, but not woke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3153.4s	3153.4	 Isn't it going to be socialism?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3155.4s	3155.4	 It probably is going to be socialism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3157.4s	3157.4	 But if you lay waste to the center, you know, you're left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3161.4s	3161.4	 Like, I mean, that's basically what happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3163.4s	3163.4	 I've been a Republican.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3165.4s	3165.4	 And now if you're saying the same is going to happen with the Democrats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3167.4s	3167.4	 this time around, you're going to have a lot of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3169.6s	3169.6	 running for president in four years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3171.6s	3171.6	 And she won't be the right brand, though, because she's woke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3175.6s	3175.6	 You need a Sherrod Brown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3177.6s	3177.6	 You don't need AOC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3179.6s	3179.6	 We need a charismatic Democratic candidate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3181.6s	3181.6	 Somehow Sherrod Brown keeps getting elected in increasingly red Ohio
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3185.6s	3185.6	 as an old school, gravelly voiced Irish labor Democrat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3190.6s	3190.6	 And somehow Bernie ignited a movement as a very old school
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3194.7s	3194.7	 gravelly voiced Jewish Democrat, neither of whom gave a damn about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3199.7s	3199.7	 identity politics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3201.7s	3201.7	 Really, they were principally concerned with inequality and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3205.7s	3205.7	 income redistribution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3207.7s	3207.7	 I want to see that happen, but I think that's the only path forward for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3211.7s	3211.7	 Democrats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3213.7s	3213.7	 Let me go to Phil because Phil had something he wants to add there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3215.7s	3215.7	 And then we'll go to you, Chumak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3217.7s	3217.7	 Yeah, I want to say that we needed for the Democrats and they just needed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3221.8s	3221.8	 a charismatic, powerful leader with a lot of charisma.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3224.8s	3224.8	 I know that I was hanging out with one of the Trump guys that was with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3228.8s	3228.8	 them on the plane in the 2016 election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3230.8s	3230.8	 He said that he outworked Hillary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3232.8s	3232.8	 There's no doubt that he outworked Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3234.8s	3234.8	 This guy is going to seven rallies a day, showing up with a ton of energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3238.8s	3238.8	 And like him or not, he has a lot of charisma.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3242.8s	3242.8	 Also, I can't help but think that if you're talking about repeated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3246.9s	3246.9	 repudiating, sorry, I'm getting that word wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3248.9s	3248.9	 To me, this is all about I think a lot of people are really scared of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3254.9s	3254.9	 socialism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3256.9s	3256.9	 And I think it's just like even the young people who say that they love it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3260.9s	3260.9	 they're looking at their path to the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3262.9s	3262.9	 And they can still do great things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3264.9s	3264.9	 There's no doubt you can still be a 20-year-old, a 20-year-old, a 20-year-old
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3268.9s	3268.9	 who's going to be a great leader.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3270.9s	3270.9	 And I think that's the only way to get there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3273.0s	3273.0	 And I think with socialism, that goes away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3275.0s	3275.0	 I think that, look, I think if Trump does win, I don't think what it means
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3281.0s	3281.0	 is that you need a person that's at the extreme left to win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3287.0s	3287.0	 I actually counterintuitively would say the opposite, which is that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3291.0s	3291.0	 need to have a person who's at the extreme left to win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3297.0s	3297.0	 And I think that's the only way to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3299.2s	3299.2	 I actually counterintuitively would say the opposite, which is that you need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3303.2s	3303.2	 just a more credible, centered person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3307.2s	3307.2	 Now, that may only be possible if the Democratic Party cleaves in two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3311.2s	3311.2	 And the reality is the Republicans may actually quasi-cleave in two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3315.2s	3315.2	 independent of whether Trump wins or not anyways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3317.2s	3317.2	 And we'll see, as David said, how some of these Senate seats break because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3321.2s	3321.2	 if that goes in a different direction, for example, if Trump wins but we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3325.3s	3325.3	 a Democratic tie in the Senate, maybe that's not possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3331.3s	3331.3	 But I think that would say a lot around the need for pragmatic but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3337.3s	3337.3	 more youthful leadership.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3339.3s	3339.3	 OK, I want to go around the horn right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3341.3s	3341.3	 What is your gut telling me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3343.3s	3343.3	 Who is going to win, given what we know right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3347.3s	3347.3	 Everybody give it a thought.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3349.3s	3349.3	 When you're ready, look into the camera and I will call on you, Michael.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3353.4s	3353.4	 You're looking into the camera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3355.4s	3355.4	 Who's going to win?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3357.4s	3357.4	 If you had to pick one right now, Michael, give us your best guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3359.4s	3359.4	 You spot me the winner of the recount in North Carolina because that would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3363.4s	3363.4	 tell me a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3365.4s	3365.4	 But I increasingly think Trump is going to win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3367.4s	3367.4	 OK, Phil, you're looking in the camera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3369.4s	3369.4	 Who do you think is going to win?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3371.4s	3371.4	 We've seen this movie before, except that Hillary was actually five to one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3375.4s	3375.4	 favorite last time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3377.4s	3377.4	 And I watched these numbers go straight up and now I'm watching the same thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3381.5s	3381.5	 Although I will say this, you know, Sachs has been posting some stuff within
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3385.5s	3385.5	 our channel about the numbers popping up and down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3387.5s	3387.5	 I'm getting texts and they are popping up and down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3389.5s	3389.5	 But still the lowest I've seen is 2.5 to one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3391.5s	3391.5	 I think Trump wins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3393.5s	3393.5	 Trump wins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3395.5s	3395.5	 Who do you got, Sachs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3397.5s	3397.5	 Well, I'm going to assume the betting markets know something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3399.5s	3399.5	 I'm still a little bit unclear on North Carolina because I saw some tweets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3405.5s	3405.5	 that Biden had wanted by a few thousand votes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3409.6s	3409.6	 But the North Carolina website is showing that actually Trump's ahead by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3415.6s	3415.6	 like 70,000 votes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3417.6s	3417.6	 So I'm not sure who to believe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3419.6s	3419.6	 You've got to pick one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3421.6s	3421.6	 Pick somebody, Sachs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3423.6s	3423.6	 I'm going to go with what the betting markets are saying, which is Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3427.6s	3427.6	 And, you know, I thought that he had a much better shot than the polls were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3433.6s	3433.6	 reflecting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3435.6s	3435.6	 And that's what it's looking like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3437.8s	3437.8	 What do you got, Freiburg?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3439.8s	3439.8	 Donald Trump took on coronavirus for us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3443.8s	3443.8	 He killed it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3445.8s	3445.8	 He is our true leader and he will prevail here in the United States of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3451.8s	3451.8	 America tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3453.8s	3453.8	 At least the betting markets are telling me and the treasury markets and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3457.8s	3457.8	 the S&P futures are telling me that Donald Trump is going to win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3459.8s	3459.8	 But I do think that the fact that this guy has never conceded defeat to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3463.9s	3463.9	 Trump in his life gives him a huge leg up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3467.9s	3467.9	 He is like Steve Jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3469.9s	3469.9	 He warps reality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3471.9s	3471.9	 And he tells everyone, I am going to win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3473.9s	3473.9	 I have killed coronavirus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3475.9s	3475.9	 And it happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3477.9s	3477.9	 Wait, like a Jedi Knight?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3479.9s	3479.9	 Like a Jedi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3481.9s	3481.9	 All right, Chamath, four of four so far picking Trump at exactly 7 45 p.m.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3487.9s	3487.9	 California time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3489.9s	3489.9	 Chamath, who do you have at this point if you had to shove your chips all in?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3492.0s	3492.0	 I still think the path is I think it is Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3502.0s	3502.0	 And I have the advantage of some information which is that they just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3508.0s	3508.0	 announced breaking news, they aren't counting mail-in votes in Philadelphia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3512.0s	3512.0	 tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3514.0s	3514.0	 And I am going with Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3516.0s	3516.0	 So we don't know Pennsylvania tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3520.1s	3520.1	 So if it is down to a few thousand votes, Philly I think is going to break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3524.1s	3524.1	 I think you can count that as three or four hundred thousand votes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3528.1s	3528.1	 It should be 500,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3530.1s	3530.1	 It should be 500,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3532.1s	3532.1	 Well, then 500,000 would carry the state for Joe Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3534.1s	3534.1	 They counted 100,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3536.1s	3536.1	 So I am going to stick with Biden here because I think that that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3540.1s	3540.1	 Philadelphia vote count is crucial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3542.1s	3542.1	 It turns out that it may come down to Philly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3544.1s	3544.1	 Which by the way, I think it is a great opportunity to talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3548.2s	3548.2	 the election of the city of underdogs, the city of Rocky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3550.2s	3550.2	 I think we can safely say that Biden is going to win the popular vote and it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3554.2s	3554.2	 might be by four points, five points, which means that there is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3558.2s	3558.2	 discrepancy between the popular vote and electoral college.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3562.2s	3562.2	 We are going to hear a lot about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3564.2s	3564.2	 I am going to go with Biden because my opinion is that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3568.2s	3568.2	 election of the city of underdogs is going to be a big one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3572.2s	3572.2	 And I think that the city of underdogs is going to be a big one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3576.4s	3576.4	 Because my heart is going to be so broken if this country picks this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3582.4s	3582.4	 sociopath to run it for another four years after his absolute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3588.4s	3588.4	 failure to do even the most modest things to battle coronavirus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3596.4s	3596.4	 And the strife he has caused between Americans and his personal style is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3602.5s	3602.5	 striking to me that I don't know that I can believe in America if they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3608.5s	3608.5	 put this absolutely sociopathic person who has the least amount of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3614.5s	3614.5	 character of any other human being anybody on this call has ever met
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3618.5s	3618.5	 in their lives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3620.5s	3620.5	 It would be a complete, absolute utter disgrace if he makes it into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3624.5s	3624.5	 office for a second term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3626.5s	3626.5	 And he is an existential problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3628.5s	3628.5	 Sex?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3630.6s	3630.6	 Hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3632.6s	3632.6	 It is an existential threat to the entire planet and humanity and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3636.6s	3636.6	 democracy across the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3638.6s	3638.6	 If this country puts that maniac into office again for four goddamn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3642.6s	3642.6	 fucking more years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3644.6s	3644.6	 That is my personal feeling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3646.6s	3646.6	 I don't care what the statistics say right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3650.6s	3650.6	 In my heart, I cannot give that man even a benefit of the doubt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3656.6s	3656.6	 Garbage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3658.7s	3658.7	 If he wins, is Fauci the first guy fired?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3660.7s	3660.7	 I think you can count on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3662.7s	3662.7	 Fauci and Christopher Ray, the FBI director.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3664.7s	3664.7	 And increasingly maybe Bill Barr too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3666.7s	3666.7	 And Bill Barr is not enough of a sycophant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3668.7s	3668.7	 Any shred of credibility or honor is gone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3670.7s	3670.7	 I want to just say to J. Cal, I really empathize with how you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3676.7s	3676.7	 feeling because I have never as a person that has been a citizen of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3682.8s	3682.8	 three countries, when I moved to America in 2000, I have never really,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3688.8s	3688.8	 edge cases, yeah, I've felt some racism here obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3692.8s	3692.8	 But I've never felt so unwanted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3694.8s	3694.8	 And I remember 2016 for the first time in my life feeling a level of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3700.8s	3700.8	 insecurity I had never felt before because I was so afraid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3704.8s	3704.8	 I didn't know what it meant for Donald Trump to be a president.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3709.0s	3709.0	 Four years later, in so many ways, it's like two realms of a coin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3719.0s	3719.0	 I leave my house and you can just see that there's just so much pain and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3725.0s	3725.0	 divisiveness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3727.0s	3727.0	 I come back into my little world and things seem to be really great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3731.0s	3731.0	 And that's a really, really terrible feeling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3735.1s	3735.1	 I wanted to tell you guys, I've always been sort of like, okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3741.1s	3741.1	 Biden's going to win, Biden's going to win, Biden's going to win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3747.1s	3747.1	 And then there's a weird thing that I did and you guys can see it in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3753.1s	3753.1	 FEC filings, but I gave a million bucks this year in the elections, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3759.1s	3759.1	 I gave 750 to the Senate and I gave 250 to Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3763.2s	3763.2	 I understand why I did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3765.2s	3765.2	 And I explained it to Nat as, she's like, why did you do it that way?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3771.2s	3771.2	 And the best way that I could explain it is I think that there is so much I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3777.2s	3777.2	 don't know about what is driving the vote for president that I wanted to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3783.2s	3783.2	 sure that there are checks and balances and the best check and balance was to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3789.3s	3789.3	 make sure that there was a lot of people that were going to vote for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3793.3s	3793.3	 president and that they were going to get a little bit of a check and balance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3799.3s	3799.3	 on Biden, I mean on Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3801.3s	3801.3	 So I'm going to accept the result.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3805.3s	3805.3	 I'm going to try to figure out what the fuck I don't know because this is yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3809.3s	3809.3	 another layer of I clearly don't know what the hell is going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3813.3s	3813.3	 But I can tell you pretty assuredly, guys, any result that's called tonight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3817.4s	3817.4	 is that they're not going to call Pennsylvania because they're not going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3819.4s	3819.4	 to call Philly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3821.4s	3821.4	 And so if there are in fact three, no, I think that the exact math is about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3827.4s	3827.4	 350,000 votes that show up in Philadelphia, a gap of 350,000 votes that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3833.4s	3833.4	 show up in Philly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3835.4s	3835.4	 Biden will do what he needs to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3837.4s	3837.4	 By the way, how many people live in Philly?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3839.4s	3839.4	 Does anybody know how many registered voters?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3841.4s	3841.4	 Friedberg, is that on the?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3843.6s	3843.6	 Philly, there's supposed to be like half a million votes coming in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3847.6s	3847.6	 And I think they've counted 100,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3849.6s	3849.6	 And so I think it'd be more than half a million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3852.6s	3852.6	 Usually the Dems margin is about half a million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3856.6s	3856.6	 The margin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3858.6s	3858.6	 Yeah, Philly is, I want to say our fifth or sixth largest market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3862.6s	3862.6	 They've actually got it listed on the pretty significant population on that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3866.6s	3866.6	 link I sent you there, Nick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3868.6s	3868.6	 And then if you click on click to view precincts reporting, you can see the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3872.7s	3872.7	 data right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3874.7s	3874.7	 Sorry, it's tough to read.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3876.7s	3876.7	 Yeah, I mean, we care about Allegheny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3878.7s	3878.7	 And then what else do we care about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3880.7s	3880.7	 You care about Philly and you care about those immediate suburbs outside of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3884.7s	3884.7	 Philly, like Box County and Chester County.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3887.7s	3887.7	 And there's four or five ringed suburbs of Philly that used to be the centerpiece
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3895.7s	3895.7	 of country club republicanism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3897.7s	3897.7	 They're the counties that elected Arlen Specter to the Senate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3899.8s	3899.8	 But over time, as the Republicans moved right, they moved more toward the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3903.8s	3903.8	 Democrats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3905.8s	3905.8	 Michael, do you know why they're going to stop reporting mail-in ballots
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3908.8s	3908.8	 tonight?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3910.8s	3910.8	 Why would they do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3912.8s	3912.8	 Probably just to go home and sleep for a while before they pick it up tomorrow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3916.8s	3916.8	 Pennsylvania, unfortunately, and Michigan as well, are states that aren't allowed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3920.8s	3920.8	 to start tabulating until all the polls are closed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3923.8s	3923.8	 That's why those states in the Sun Belt, we were all looking for to be early
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3927.9s	3927.9	 bellwether because they can count.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3929.9s	3929.9	 Look at that, guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3931.9s	3931.9	 Unbelievable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3933.9s	3933.9	 4.81%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3935.9s	3935.9	 This is unbelievable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3937.9s	3937.9	 Unbelievable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3939.9s	3939.9	 What are we seeing here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3941.9s	3941.9	 What's unbelievable, Chamathak?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3943.9s	3943.9	 So what that means, Jason, is that in Philadelphia, there are 1,706 precincts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3947.9s	3947.9	 Of those, only 82 have reported their ballot tallies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3952.0s	3952.0	 So you have 95% of the precincts in Philly not reporting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3958.0s	3958.0	 If you take Michael's framework and say there's a swing of 500,000 votes if it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3963.0s	3963.0	 goes historically Democrat, as it has in the past, you attack on 500,000 net new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3970.0s	3970.0	 votes to Biden and he ekes out a win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3978.0s	3978.0	 Yeah, it goes blue probably in that scenario.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3980.2s	3980.2	 So then it becomes about, remember though, if Trump is holding, if he manages to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3986.2s	3986.2	 hold Michigan, he could lose Pennsylvania.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3990.2s	3990.2	 It wouldn't matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3992.2s	3992.2	 He had a little bit of a margin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3994.2s	3994.2	 He had 306 electoral votes last time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=3996.2s	3996.2	 So if he holds everything he had minus Pennsylvania, actually, he could lose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4000.2s	4000.2	 Michigan too as long as he carried Wisconsin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4002.2s	4002.2	 He has to have one of those two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4004.2s	4004.2	 But I think that's the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4006.3s	4006.3	 By the way, for all of our listeners and watchers in New Jersey, they legalize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4010.3s	4010.3	 recreational pots, so go out and get yourself some.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4014.3s	4014.3	 I just took four gummies after my little tirade there because the two Xanax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4022.3s	4022.3	 weren't working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4024.3s	4024.3	 So that's going to get really strange for me in about an hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4028.3s	4028.3	 But I'm going to go ahead and get some.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4030.4s	4030.4	 I mean, are we going to crack a bottle of wine or what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4032.4s	4032.4	 I already got one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4034.4s	4034.4	 This is mostly coffee, but trust me, there's some Irish whiskey in here too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4038.4s	4038.4	 Michael, I guess I'm speaking to you, but it looks like I'm seeing reports of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4040.4s	4040.4	 the sound of Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4042.4s	4042.4	 Unfortunately, all four of those states are going to probably take at least a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4046.4s	4046.4	 day, Arizona, three days, I think, to count.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4050.4s	4050.4	 So I think that's the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4052.4s	4052.4	 I think that's the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4054.4s	4054.4	 I think that's the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4056.5s	4056.5	 I think that's the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4058.5s	4058.5	 Maybe not this year because so much of the vote was early, maybe it will move
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4062.5s	4062.5	 faster, but they are notoriously slow counters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4064.5s	4064.5	 Settle in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4066.5s	4066.5	 It could be the weekend before we have a result.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4068.5s	4068.5	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4070.5s	4070.5	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4072.5s	4072.5	 So let me just drop this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4074.5s	4074.5	 If we don't know tonight what is going to happen over the next week, we're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4080.5s	4080.5	 to have a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4084.6s	4084.6	 long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, up and down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4086.6s	4086.6	 Well, we're going to need a lot of gummies, Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4088.6s	4088.6	 No, I mean, joking aside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4090.6s	4090.6	 I think everybody is going to be tense, Jay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4096.6s	4096.6	 I don't think you're going to see a lot of action, one way or the other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4098.6s	4098.6	 I think that people, I think people in America are incredibly good people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4100.6s	4100.6	 I think that folks are just going to sit tight and hope that the folks whose job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4104.6s	4104.6	 it is to do their job, do their job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4106.6s	4106.6	 I hope you're right, Shamath, but when I see a group of folks that have around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4113.3s	4113.3	 people's cars, when I see people bringing guns on both sides, horrible people on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4119.3s	4119.3	 both sides, bringing guns, malicious style to specifically taunt each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4125.3s	4125.3	 When you see people getting shot in the street, chasing each other down over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4129.3s	4129.3	 politics, this is something that has not happened in our lifetime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4132.3s	4132.3	 I mean, Phil's very old, so he kind of remembers the sixties.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4135.3s	4135.3	 But for the rest of us under 68, we, we have not witnessed any of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4141.4s	4141.4	 We, we have not witnessed Americans shooting each other in the street over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4147.4s	4147.4	 politics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4148.4s	4148.4	 We have not witnessed people taking people out of their lives because of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4153.4s	4153.4	 politics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4154.4s	4154.4	 And this is got Trump's fingerprints on it from top to bottom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4158.4s	4158.4	 You mean since the summer?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4160.4s	4160.4	 I mean, what about all the looting and rioting and protests?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4163.4s	4163.4	 My point is when Trump got in office, his character and his ability to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4171.4s	4171.4	 trigger people, his ability to abuse people, his rhetoric put everybody on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4177.4s	4177.4	 tilt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4178.4s	4178.4	 I'm not saying people looting stores are correct, but what I'm saying is George
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4182.4s	4182.4	 Bush and Ronald Reagan, your heroes, Bill Clinton, Obama, other people's heroes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4188.4s	4188.4	 on this call.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4189.4s	4189.4	 There was a, there was a, a kindness in our differences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4193.4s	4193.4	 And when people conceded, they conceded with grace.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4197.4s	4197.4	 And this individual, this horrible human being.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4199.5s	4199.5	 Bush wasn't a hero of mine, but I'll.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4202.5s	4202.5	 Putting it aside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4203.5s	4203.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4204.5s	4204.5	 I think Reagan was maybe Bush senior was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4206.5s	4206.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4207.5s	4207.5	 Look, I respect him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4209.5s	4209.5	 He's classiness and we had a mutual respect for each other that this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4213.5s	4213.5	 deranged individual has removed from America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4217.5s	4217.5	 And I'm not going to defend what's going to happen in the next week because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4222.5s	4222.5	 I'm not, I'm not defending each other leading up to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4224.5s	4224.5	 I think the next week should be incredibly violent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4227.6s	4227.6	 Incredibly violent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4228.6s	4228.6	 You are fake dudes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4229.6s	4229.6	 Thank you for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4231.6s	4231.6	 You are fake dudes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4233.6s	4233.6	 Now look, Jason, I'm not going to like disagree with you about any of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4236.6s	4236.6	 The only thing I would add though, is I do think that the media has been a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4241.6s	4241.6	 co-equal partner in sowing this chaos and divisiveness because, you know, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4247.6s	4247.6	 used to have a media that thought its job was objectivity and neutrality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4253.6s	4253.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4254.7s	4254.7	 They ripped the empire Jersey off their back to go after this guy, Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4257.7s	4257.7	 And, and why do you think they did?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4260.7s	4260.7	 Money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4261.7s	4261.7	 Well, it's very profitable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4263.7s	4263.7	 Trump, Trump has made big money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4265.7s	4265.7	 Picking aside, picking aside is definitely more profitable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4268.7s	4268.7	 You get more subscribers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4269.7s	4269.7	 It might also be that they were absolutely suffering from Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4273.7s	4273.7	 derangement syndrome from the fact that the person lies and that he wants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4277.7s	4277.7	 to separate children from their parents at the border.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4280.7s	4280.7	 Listen, yes, but they're supposed to, they have a job to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4283.9s	4283.9	 They're supposed to be neutral.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4284.9s	4284.9	 They were supposed to be a rational opposition to Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4286.9s	4286.9	 Yeah, but exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4287.9s	4287.9	 But the, but the reason why Trump is doing well or better is because the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4292.9s	4292.9	 opposition to him is increasingly irrational and, and people have voted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4297.9s	4297.9	 for Trump to, to, to basically give the middle finger to, to, to the, to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4302.9s	4302.9	 media who, you know, again, who are taking sides to these big tech sensors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4307.9s	4307.9	 you know, who don't want us to read things that are critical of Trump, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4312.0s	4312.0	 know, and so on down the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4313.0s	4313.0	 I mean, I, I tweeted earlier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4316.0s	4316.0	 I mean, Rich Lowry had a great post explaining why if Trump was going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4320.0s	4320.0	 win, why, you know, why, why that would happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4323.0s	4323.0	 And it's because he's the only middle finger available to these people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4326.0s	4326.0	 And, you know, I don't disagree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4329.0s	4329.0	 He's not being, no one's voting for Trump because of his integrity, perceived
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4334.0s	4334.0	 integrity or integrity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4337.0s	4337.0	 It's the first time I've heard integrity in the same sentences, Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4340.1s	4340.1	 I thought you're, I'm agreeing with that point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4343.1s	4343.1	 I'm saying they're not voting for him because of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4345.1s	4345.1	 They're not voting for him because of even a second term agenda.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4348.1s	4348.1	 They're voting for him in order to stop cultural forces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4353.1s	4353.1	 They don't like, I have two things to say decidedly, by the way, two things to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4360.1s	4360.1	 say, according to the national political writer for the Philly inquire,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4368.2s	4368.2	 Jonathan Tamari, his tweet of 7.35 PM said, actually, it was even greater than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4375.2s	4375.2	 we thought.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4376.2s	4376.2	 There are still 2.2 million mail in ballots to be counted in PA, about 87%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4381.2s	4381.2	 of the total.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4382.2s	4382.2	 So if that's true, then we have that and Philly, number one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4387.2s	4387.2	 The second thing I wanted to say is that if you actually look at the sum counts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4391.2s	4391.2	 right now in Pennsylvania, it's 371, 591 votes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4396.3s	4396.3	 That's separate Trump and Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4399.3s	4399.3	 So it's, you know, not that much guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4404.3s	4404.3	 If 2.2 million votes are outstanding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4407.3s	4407.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4408.3s	4408.3	 But if it's, if it's two, if it's, let's see, 60% or two third kind of to one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4413.3s	4413.3	 third slash 40%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4415.3s	4415.3	 And it's not, let's say it comes in under that, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4418.3s	4418.3	 They probably counted a couple hundred thousand already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4420.3s	4420.3	 I mean, it is still pretty close.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4422.3s	4422.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4423.5s	4423.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4424.5s	4424.5	 Really close.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4426.5s	4426.5	 Let me, let me ask, Chamath, do you think that part of the reason we're seeing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4431.5s	4431.5	 futures markets jump and the dollar jump and and all the kind of obviously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4441.5s	4441.5	 correlated assets moving the way they are is not necessarily because of a Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4445.5s	4445.5	 win, but because the risk of a hung election seems to be coming out of the system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4450.6s	4450.6	 right now that it seems like we're going to have a much more clear outcome here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4454.6s	4454.6	 than we thought we would.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4455.6s	4455.6	 Florida is going to be much more clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4457.6s	4457.6	 That's always a worry state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4459.6s	4459.6	 Georgia is going to be clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4461.6s	4461.6	 Obviously we've still got Pennsylvania to kind of figure out here, but it seems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4465.6s	4465.6	 like this is going to break one way or another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4467.6s	4467.6	 Whereas a lot of folks were concerned we'd end up in the court fighting over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4470.6s	4470.6	 hanging Chad's for months and there was concern in the markets for months about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4474.6s	4474.6	 that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4475.6s	4475.6	 Do we think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4476.7s	4476.7	 No, I think that people were basically look, there's a reason to be long Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4483.7s	4483.7	 in the markets, which is essentially that there are certain sectors of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4487.7s	4487.7	 economy that would have done very well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4489.7s	4489.7	 Those sectors of the economy were probably slightly different than Trump's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4495.7s	4495.7	 under a Trump regime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4497.7s	4497.7	 The reality is that corporate taxes, broadly speaking, are not going to go up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4500.7s	4500.7	 And so, you know, you can forecast higher earnings power for every stock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4504.8s	4504.8	 And so everything goes up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4506.8s	4506.8	 I think what's happening right now is more of that relief trade of maybe Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4513.8s	4513.8	 was winning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4514.8s	4514.8	 So you could be kind of long everything blindly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4516.8s	4516.8	 But, you know, the real canary in the coal mine was like, if you looked at tech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4520.8s	4520.8	 futures, tech futures was just going bonkers when they thought he was going to win
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4524.8s	4524.8	 because they will probably disproportionately benefit of just having to pay no taxes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4528.8s	4528.8	 because they pay no taxes today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4530.9s	4530.9	 I so so that's kind of like what I what I think is happening on on that side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4536.9s	4536.9	 I mean, Trump is very pro-business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4538.9s	4538.9	 That's why the markets are ripping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4540.9s	4540.9	 I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4541.9s	4541.9	 I mean, I feel like there was a real concern like there was a non-zero case
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4545.9s	4545.9	 here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4546.9s	4546.9	 Call it a 30 percent case that we were going to get stuck for a few months with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4549.9s	4549.9	 uncertainty and litigation about where this election was going to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4552.9s	4552.9	 I think I think it's fair to say that we still we could still have that, David,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4557.1s	4557.1	 because we don't if this goes to tomorrow, I think it's fair to say that that the game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4563.1s	4563.1	 theory would tell you that tomorrow, whoever loses Pennsylvania should ask for an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4567.5s	4567.5	 immediate recount.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4568.5s	4568.5	 Right. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4569.5s	4569.5	 And I don't know what the they have to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4571.3s	4571.3	 I don't know what the process for that is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4573.1s	4573.1	 If whoever loses Arizona should ask for an immediate recount, you know, whatever is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4578.9s	4578.9	 possible under the law.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4580.5s	4580.5	 I think both Biden and Trump will exercise because let's face it, this is the highest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4585.1s	4585.1	 stakes possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4586.2s	4586.2	 And so you would hate to not if it's a margin of a few thousands of votes or tens of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4591.2s	4591.2	 thousands of votes or even 100000 votes and you're allowed to do a recount.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4595.2s	4595.2	 So if that's the case tomorrow morning, if we go to bed in another hour and a half or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4600.2s	4600.2	 if you finish this thing in another hour and there is no winner, clear winner, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4605.9s	4605.9	 markets will be back to sort of modestly risk off tomorrow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4610.0s	4610.0	 So, David, your thesis is that your thesis is clear winner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4613.5s	4613.5	 The markets are up either way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4615.9s	4615.9	 Clear winner. It's just like there was a lot of grinding expected here that was going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4619.8s	4619.8	 cause a lot of trepidation and bouncing for a while that folks were concerned about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4625.0s	4625.0	 And if you feel like you're going to have a clear election outcome or whether or not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4628.3s	4628.3	 it gets litigated, if you feel clear about where it's going to go because it's fifty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4632.5s	4632.5	 five, forty five, you know, sure, they're going to ask for a recount.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4634.8s	4634.8	 It's good news for everybody. Makes sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4636.3s	4636.3	 Look, I think the market does not want those Trump tax cuts repealed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4640.6s	4640.6	 Stocks just ripped after Trump passed those corporate tax cuts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4644.5s	4644.5	 So if either Trump wins or the Republicans hold on to the Senate, then that would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4651.3s	4651.3	 a reason for the market to rip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4653.1s	4653.1	 Doesn't mean it doesn't mean Trump has to win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4655.1s	4655.1	 But but but if we have divided government gridlock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4658.2s	4658.2	 So between the two of you, the best best possible scenario for the market is if Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4661.9s	4661.9	 clearly wins. OK, I think I think we have another best online.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4666.5s	4666.5	 Is it the case if we look at the Senate races?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4669.8s	4669.8	 I don't know if anyone I don't know if there's an easy way for us to pull this up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4673.4s	4673.4	 But we have to pull that up, David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4675.3s	4675.3	 And I just want to introduce our next bestie guest, Brad Gerstner is here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4685.1s	4685.1	 I believe you would call it a hedge fund or a fund.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4688.1s	4688.1	 Yeah. And he invests large swaths of money in the American economy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4701.5s	4701.5	 with covid and airlines being grounded, this has not been the easiest year for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4706.2s	4706.2	 So apologies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4707.3s	4707.3	 Now, Brad, Brad just made 10 billion dollars on snowflake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4709.7s	4709.7	 He's fine. Snowflake man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4715.7s	4715.7	 Brad, what's going on?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4723.1s	4723.1	 You know, it's a it's a fascinating night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4727.9s	4727.9	 I mean, all markets are ripping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4729.8s	4729.8	 We've had a massive reversal in the Nasdaq, a massive reversal in the bond market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4736.1s	4736.1	 And it it appears that, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4739.9s	4739.9	 everybody is now who is worried about a Trump victory is now celebrating a Trump victory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4745.9s	4745.9	 You know, one of the things people didn't understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4749.5s	4749.5	 about a clear Biden victory is the underlying concern in the bond market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4756.1s	4756.1	 Right. If there's one thing to explain, the expansion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4759.0s	4759.0	 and multiples in the market this year is the fact that rates have collapsed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4764.9s	4764.9	 Right. So the 30 and 10 year went from,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4768.6s	4768.6	 you know, a couple of hundred basis points 20 months ago to basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4773.5s	4773.5	 50 basis points in August of this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4776.4s	4776.4	 We've seen them back up about 40 percent over the course of the last couple of months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4781.2s	4781.2	 We see them backing up again tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4783.6s	4783.6	 The fact is, the market is seriously concerned about higher rates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4789.0s	4789.0	 Which are the result of both a turbocharged economy, too much stimulus on top of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4795.3s	4795.3	 you know, vaccines and prophylactics for covid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4798.9s	4798.9	 And so, you know, if you ask me, you know, we get all excited about the election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4803.9s	4803.9	 We get all excited about stimulus and tax policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4806.2s	4806.2	 But the biggest elephant in the room is the Fed and rates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4809.2s	4809.2	 That's the 80 to 90 percent factor in the market this year in Q4 of 18.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4814.3s	4814.3	 And so what I'm what we're looking at, you know, we see the the Nasdaq
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4818.3s	4818.3	 now up 350 bips, the futures up 350 bips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4821.6s	4821.6	 So that says Trump's winning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4823.2s	4823.2	 We're not going to break up the tech companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4825.8s	4825.8	 We see the S&P starting to rise again and we see the bond market falling,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4830.3s	4830.3	 saying that we're going to have lower stimulus right in the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4836.1s	4836.1	 So, you know, I've heard I've heard you all talk about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4840.4s	4840.4	 you know, a clear victory certainly is better than not a clear victory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4845.1s	4845.1	 But, you know, notwithstanding our own fucking anxiety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4849.7s	4849.7	 that we have to live with for the next four years in the short run,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4854.3s	4854.3	 the market is clearly voting on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4857.9s	4857.9	 you know, is voting that Trump is a palatable alternative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4863.5s	4863.5	 And I would tell you to keep your eyes on rates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4866.8s	4866.8	 And what's your on the market, Brad, more than a great manager of money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4872.0s	4872.0	 You're actually a great human being, but you're also very wired into the Dems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4877.4s	4877.4	 What are the Dems getting wrong if they lose today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4881.2s	4881.2	 Well, you know, first, this is an upset already tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4886.6s	4886.6	 Let's call it. This is a massive upset relative to expectations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4891.6s	4891.6	 When are lose the reversal in the betting markets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4895.5s	4895.5	 the reversal in the stock market, you know, as just earlier tonight,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4901.2s	4901.2	 you know, a well-known organizers house on the Democratic side.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4907.6s	4907.6	 This is a massive upset by Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4911.6s	4911.6	 And once again, a massive misread by the progressives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4915.4s	4915.4	 and organizers in the Democratic Party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4917.4s	4917.4	 You know, I had my 84 year old mother out here from Michigan over the weekend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4922.0s	4922.0	 And I'll tell you that ordinary people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4926.9s	4926.9	 Are made to be to feel bad about themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4931.2s	4931.2	 By people living in these parts, the sanctimony that exists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4937.6s	4937.6	 in urban areas, you know, and coastal elites is just it's it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4945.2s	4945.2	 You know, this is what we're seeing people vote against, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4948.7s	4948.7	 The idea that you're going to close down the state of Michigan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4951.6s	4951.6	 not allow people to take their boats out on lakes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4954.4s	4954.4	 This is just, you know, not something that people are willing to tolerate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4957.8s	4957.8	 And I think more than anything else tonight, you see a protest vote against sanctimony.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4965.4s	4965.4	 And this is just ordinary people saying that, you know, let us live our lives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4971.5s	4971.5	 Don't act so much smarter than us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4975.4s	4975.4	 You know, and, you know, I asked my 84 year old mother,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4982.8s	4982.8	 That's none of your business, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4984.3s	4984.3	 Like, that's her way of telling me, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4986.7s	4986.7	 That, you know, that she's frustrated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4991.7s	4991.7	 by how people in San Francisco make her feel living in Michigan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4997.1s	4997.1	 I think that's I think that's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=4998.7s	4998.7	 That's so smart. But David Sacks, before you talk, he's talking about you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5004.0s	5004.0	 Well, no, look, I mean, I'm on Twitter and I echo change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5007.9s	5007.9	 Technology extremely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5009.4s	5009.4	 I mean, it's usually VCs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5012.1s	5012.1	 Basically, they can't comprehend how somebody could have a political opinion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5016.5s	5016.5	 That's different than them without that person literally being evil.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5020.0s	5020.0	 I mean, I see this on Twitter over and over and over again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5023.2s	5023.2	 I'm like, really?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5028.8s	5028.8	 And I'm just like, look, I mean, political opinions are like assholes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5032.6s	5032.6	 I mean, everyone's got one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5034.1s	5034.1	 And to think that yours is a lot prettier than everybody else's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5036.8s	5036.8	 And it's a bit ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5039.0s	5039.0	 I welcome everybody to the podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5041.7s	5041.7	 If you're just tuning in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5042.8s	5042.8	 Well, the family hour just ended. There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5045.5s	5045.5	 Brad, Brad, can I ask a question?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5048.1s	5048.1	 What? Like, what do we do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5054.9s	5054.9	 Yeah, you know, for me, listen, a Trump victory,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5058.6s	5058.6	 the reality is we've learned to tolerate the anxiety over the last four years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5063.4s	5063.4	 And I think the market's fully prepared to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5066.8s	5066.8	 to manage its way through another four years of Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5069.2s	5069.2	 So I think that's the reason we're seeing the the futures react the way they are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5074.7s	5074.7	 It's it's a whole lot of nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5076.2s	5076.2	 I mean, the fact of the matter is asking, how do we get off of our horses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5079.3s	5079.3	 if we're on horses, the social elites?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5081.7s	5081.7	 Well, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5084.3s	5084.3	 this is going to take a complete rewiring, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5088.5s	5088.5	 Like an abandonment of, you know, the I mean, listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5093.1s	5093.1	 you and I all know the exodus of people out of the Bay Area right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5098.1s	5098.1	 Right. The fact of the matter is like pragmatic politics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5101.6s	5101.6	 and the Democratic Party in the state of California vacated long ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5106.4s	5106.4	 And, you know, that is not a recipe for victory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5110.0s	5110.0	 It's not a recipe for victory at a national level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5112.2s	5112.2	 It's not a recipe for victory or tolerable victory at a state level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5115.7s	5115.7	 I think we're going to have the single largest migration of economic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5121.1s	5121.1	 the single largest economic migration in the history of this country,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5125.2s	5125.2	 the convergence of covid, which allows people to work from anywhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5129.5s	5129.5	 and the risk of changing tax policies in states like California
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5134.0s	5134.0	 is going to cause mass economic migration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5136.5s	5136.5	 And I think that people are voting with their feet and they're voting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5139.0s	5139.0	 with their wallets and they're voting, you know, tonight in loud numbers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5143.2s	5143.2	 no matter where this where this comes down, this is an upset
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5147.1s	5147.1	 and a defeat for what Democrats expected to occur tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5151.5s	5151.5	 Do you buy the framing, Brad, that this is about political
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5154.5s	5154.5	 correctness versus cancel culture?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5158.1s	5158.1	 Yeah, I think that's I think that's a big part of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5160.2s	5160.2	 I mean, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5163.8s	5163.8	 I think it comes out, it's it's amplified this year because of covid,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5168.1s	5168.1	 but it comes down to something very simple, which I talked about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5173.3s	5173.3	 You know, sometimes my sister likes to call me fancy pants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5177.2s	5177.2	 Right. She's like, oh, you fancy people live in San Francisco.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5180.1s	5180.1	 You have all the answers. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5182.3s	5182.3	 This is just the way that people in Indiana and Michigan and Ohio,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5186.6s	5186.6	 they're made to feel every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5188.5s	5188.5	 You know, they'll sit around watching Fox News.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5191.3s	5191.3	 These are not people who are racist. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5194.2s	5194.2	 Chamath, I heard you say earlier tonight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5196.7s	5196.7	 the idea that Trump could pull what he's pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5200.7s	5200.7	 And yet, if you talk to all of our friends,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5203.7s	5203.7	 they would have you believe that it was just a small band of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5207.9s	5207.9	 you know, racist pickup drivers carrying Trump flags.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5210.9s	5210.9	 I mean, they are their head is in the sand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5213.5s	5213.5	 Yeah, this is this is CEOs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5216.2s	5216.2	 Yeah. You know, these are business owners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5218.1s	5218.1	 These are small business owners. These are farmers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5220.7s	5220.7	 These are old people. These are young people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5223.0s	5223.0	 I mean, the the millennials, you can't find a millennial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5226.5s	5226.5	 in the state of Indiana or Michigan who supports Biden. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5229.9s	5229.9	 Yeah. Find them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5231.7s	5231.7	 And I mean, just add to that point about what they think about people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5234.7s	5234.7	 in San Francisco, why shouldn't they think that when tech giants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5239.0s	5239.0	 and the people who work at these big tech companies like Twitter and Facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5242.3s	5242.3	 are asserting a right to censor articles that they don't like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5246.6s	5246.6	 and trying to assert a power over what the American people get to see and read?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5251.3s	5251.3	 I mean, what a campaign issue that was for Trump in the last two weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5255.0s	5255.0	 I mean, whatever Twitter and Facebook thought they were doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5258.6s	5258.6	 to protect or help the Biden campaign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5261.0s	5261.0	 I mean, what a blunder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5262.8s	5262.8	 I mean, to give Trump the issue of censorship in the last two weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5266.1s	5266.1	 And then the extraordinary thing, you know, we had that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5268.3s	5268.3	 that congressional hearing in the Senate Commerce Committee
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5270.5s	5270.5	 that I wrote a blog about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5272.1s	5272.1	 And the amazing thing is right on the heels of that, after that hearing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5275.1s	5275.1	 when we heard Jack Dorsey get that, you know, he just got grilled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5278.8s	5278.8	 He got ripped apart by the senators.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5281.0s	5281.0	 Twitter doubled down on censorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5282.5s	5282.5	 After that, there was an article by Jonathan Turley talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5284.6s	5284.6	 they censored a whole new batch of accounts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5287.6s	5287.6	 And so if anything, you know, it'll be really interesting to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5291.5s	5291.5	 I think, you know, if you think back four years ago, Facebook was really,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5295.3s	5295.3	 for whatever reason, became the scapegoat for the election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5298.5s	5298.5	 I think this time around, it's going to be Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5300.4s	5300.4	 Because they have been so arrogant and their assertion of their right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5304.1s	5304.1	 to censor viewpoints, they don't want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5307.0s	5307.0	 And if the Republicans hold on to the Senate and or the presidency,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5312.0s	5312.0	 I think you're going to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5313.7s	5313.7	 Jack Dorsey become the poster child for this new censorship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5317.4s	5317.4	 that they're going to target.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5318.9s	5318.9	 And the paradox, Friedberg, is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5322.7s	5322.7	 had they just let that New York Post story be tweeted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5327.2s	5327.2	 because it's the New York Post, this is I mean, you may not like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5330.0s	5330.0	 the New York Post, it may have a sordid past or reputation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5333.8s	5333.8	 But if that had been a New York Times story, a Washington Post story
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5337.7s	5337.7	 or an MSNBC story or a CNN story, it would not have been banned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5342.1s	5342.1	 because it's a Rupert Murdoch, New York Post story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5345.3s	5345.3	 And because it was salacious,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5347.9s	5347.9	 somebody mid level inside of Twitter decided to ban it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5352.6s	5352.6	 How much of that do you think plays into what we're seeing here tonight?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5358.5s	5358.5	 Friedberg, which is this is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5364.3s	5364.3	 a small event.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5366.2s	5366.2	 This is a large group of people saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5369.1s	5369.1	 I don't want anything to do with the Democratic Party anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5372.0s	5372.0	 I just think back to 2016 and.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5376.9s	5376.9	 You know, everyone has their own priorities,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5379.8s	5379.8	 their own individual things that matter to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5383.1s	5383.1	 And I remember in 2016 or leading up to it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5385.7s	5385.7	 I spent a lot of time in what we call kind of the rust belt and the farm belt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5391.1s	5391.1	 And if you'll remember, this was around the time of kind of the transgender
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5396.1s	5396.1	 bathroom, you know, movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5398.8s	5398.8	 Atlanta. Yeah. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5400.1s	5400.1	 And this was felt very much like a coastal elite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5404.4s	5404.4	 topic of interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5406.0s	5406.0	 If you're in the rust belt and the farm belt, you're like, what the fuck?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5409.2s	5409.2	 How is this possibly something people are spending time on and arguing about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5412.8s	5412.8	 and thinking about and the disconnect between the priorities of the individuals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5417.3s	5417.3	 that live in the vast part of the United States
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5421.7s	5421.7	 versus what they read about and hear about others treat as their priority,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5426.8s	5426.8	 I think is what partially helped support Trump getting elected in the first place,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5431.5s	5431.5	 because the things that matter to them that they felt were highly consequential
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5436.0s	5436.0	 were completely unrelated and not being paid attention to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5439.2s	5439.2	 While other folks that had the money and the power in the big cities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5443.2s	5443.2	 were focused on social matters and social issues and liberal decisions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5446.7s	5446.7	 that they thought were inconsequential or shouldn't be a priority.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5450.7s	5450.7	 And I think that fast forward to 2020 and it hasn't moved in the right direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5455.4s	5455.4	 It's moved in the wrong direction where the disconnect is no longer a passive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5460.4s	5460.4	 difference of priority.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5462.0s	5462.0	 It's actually become an active interest moving against you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5466.4s	5466.4	 And so if you live in Corn Belt or the Rust Belt or vast parts of rural America,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5472.7s	5472.7	 to your point, you're now not only feeling that there's this disconnect,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5476.5s	5476.5	 but you're also feeling like this point of view is becoming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5480.3s	5480.3	 overwhelming and stopping you from having a point of view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5483.1s	5483.1	 And I think whether your point of view is rooted in fact or not,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5485.8s	5485.8	 you can base that however you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5488.5s	5488.5	 It just feels like it's becoming a silencing effect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5491.2s	5491.2	 and not just kind of a, you know, ignoring the effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5494.6s	5494.6	 And I think let me, let me just jump in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5498.0s	5498.0	 I want to come back to this, but I want to just jump to something that Bogut
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5501.1s	5501.1	 just tweeted, Andrew Bogut, thank you for this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5504.6s	5504.6	 Detroit, Philadelphia and Milwaukee are all planning to post vote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5508.5s	5508.5	 counts tomorrow as they work through absentee backlogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5511.5s	5511.5	 So if we look at the counts, that really could mean that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5516.8s	5516.8	 Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan are either too close to call
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5522.3s	5522.3	 or not even yet ready to be called until tomorrow morning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5527.5s	5527.5	 I think let's take a pause here and let's go through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5530.7s	5530.7	 what the swing states are and where they stand at this very moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5534.5s	5534.5	 Arizona is an important toss up state, correct?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5537.3s	5537.3	 Let's pull up Arizona, Nick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5539.4s	5539.4	 Let's all just take a moment to look at Arizona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5541.5s	5541.5	 We're going to go through about six or seven of these states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5543.4s	5543.4	 and just get our bearing right now, because when we did the quick survey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5548.0s	5548.0	 about 45 minutes ago, four of us believed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5551.7s	5551.7	 Trump was going to win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5553.2s	5553.2	 Two of us believe one of us emotionally,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5556.5s	5556.5	 one of us somewhat emotionally believed that's where we were at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5560.9s	5560.9	 Guys, you want to get my guys before you start this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5564.7s	5564.7	 Hold on. Before you start this, I just want to read a tweet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5568.9s	5568.9	 to two tweets, number one from Nick Bilton.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5571.3s	5571.3	 When do we get to vote on when we fire Nate Silver?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5574.7s	5574.7	 And the second one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5576.0s	5576.0	 Wait, wait, wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5577.7s	5577.7	 The second one, which is even funnier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5579.9s	5579.9	 He's named Nate Silver because all his picks come in second place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5584.5s	5584.5	 Oh, oh, ouch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5588.0s	5588.0	 Wow. I mean, I was tweeting you guys for the election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5591.3s	5591.3	 I mean, the Nate Silver thing was a joke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5593.1s	5593.1	 First of all, he was saying that Biden was 90% favorite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5596.3s	5596.3	 And at the same time, he said that if Trump won Pennsylvania,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5600.1s	5600.1	 then he would become the favorite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5601.7s	5601.7	 But you knew that Trump was a few points of the margin of error in Pennsylvania.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5606.3s	5606.3	 So how can you be 90% favorite?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5609.9s	5609.9	 But some but but Pennsylvania is sort of neck and neck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5613.2s	5613.2	 I mean, even his own internal projections weren't consistent with each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5617.8s	5617.8	 I mean, here's silver, one of the best sports predictors in history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5621.3s	5621.3	 He's been an absolute genius.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5622.7s	5622.7	 He stepped into politics and now you guys are lashing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5625.0s	5625.0	 Yeah, but this this is the worst case of analytics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5627.4s	5627.4	 since Tampa Bay pulled their pitcher in the sixth inning of the World Series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5633.1s	5633.1	 I mean, if we look at what's happening,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5635.7s	5635.7	 it's very clear that there are people who are either
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5640.8s	5640.8	 lying to the pollsters because they're embarrassed about their choice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5644.2s	5644.2	 or they may actively be trolling the pollsters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5647.2s	5647.2	 So when a pollster calls them, they lie to them to have this exact moment happen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5653.1s	5653.1	 just like the tick tockers all registered for a Trump event.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5656.9s	5656.9	 So now we have a level of trolling going on at a national level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5660.9s	5660.9	 Hashtag poll.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5663.1s	5663.1	 I think there's a simpler explanation and that's that we're not all trolls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5667.7s	5667.7	 I think the simpler explanation is that pollsters are empiricists and they're experts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5672.3s	5672.3	 And like a lot of experts, you can kind of you can kind of interpret
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5678.3s	5678.3	 the Trump phenomenon of of overperforming now two elections in a row
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5683.7s	5683.7	 is a kind of revolt against the experts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5686.9s	5686.9	 And they don't see their biases
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5690.4s	5690.4	 the way they should. They're they're blind to certain things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5692.9s	5692.9	 There's really no excuse for how bad they miss this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5695.8s	5695.8	 Michael, they may have been experts yesterday, but they're not experts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5699.7s	5699.7	 Well, this is I mean, this is what Trump does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5702.2s	5702.2	 This is why people support him in spite of the fact that I don't think anyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5705.0s	5705.0	 disagrees with Jason's opinion of his of his character is that they love
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5709.7s	5709.7	 sticking it to the to the eggheads.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5712.0s	5712.0	 You know, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, what happens to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5717.7s	5717.7	 media like what happens to how we conduct ourselves?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5720.3s	5720.3	 Like, do you do you read the New York Times tomorrow and think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5723.3s	5723.3	 wow, I'm going to trust the Times?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5724.5s	5724.5	 I'm not saying you did before, but I'm just using it as a generality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5727.6s	5727.6	 to sort of ask the question, like what happens to media?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5730.6s	5730.6	 No, I think I think our belief in, you know, all of these polls
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5734.8s	5734.8	 and all of these mainstream press, I mean, this validates the arguments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5738.7s	5738.7	 effectively that Trump has been making right that you've been told lies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5743.3s	5743.3	 that these polls were lies, that everybody was trying to manipulate you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5747.1s	5747.1	 I mean, it's this is a validation of those who are flipping the middle finger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5753.4s	5753.4	 at Washington and at the coast and are saying we're not going to be told
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5757.2s	5757.2	 how to believe, how to think, how to vote, how to wear masks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5762.3s	5762.3	 how to wear masks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5763.7s	5763.7	 And, you know, it's a dangerous side to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5766.2s	5766.2	 100 percent. It's the end of expertise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5768.4s	5768.4	 I mean, who can we ever trust?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5770.7s	5770.7	 I mean, and this is Putin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5771.7s	5771.7	 Well, ironically, it's the experts who got mass wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5774.3s	5774.3	 Remember that at the time that I was saying that we should wear masks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5778.4s	5778.4	 the WHO was saying we shouldn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5780.9s	5780.9	 So they were lying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5782.5s	5782.5	 They were deliberately lying to keep PPE from being overrun by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5787.5s	5787.5	 So the experts have done a horrible job on Covid too, Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5790.5s	5790.5	 I mean, look, I think that's part of the reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5792.0s	5792.0	 Now, the cynicism of Trump and his approach to absolutely undermine Fauci
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5797.9s	5797.9	 and say to admonish people wearing masks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5801.8s	5801.8	 while on stage is a level of danger and is a dereliction of duty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5807.5s	5807.5	 That's insane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5808.8s	5808.8	 So we know that mask work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5810.3s	5810.3	 You actually were a proponent of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5812.7s	5812.7	 Yes, of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5813.8s	5813.8	 Masks should never become a political issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5815.5s	5815.5	 Trump last week said don't wear a mask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5818.9s	5818.9	 No, he never said he was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5820.0s	5820.0	 He literally made fun of a person wearing a mask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5824.0s	5824.0	 Let's just run through each of the states right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5826.6s	5826.6	 I can't wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5828.6s	5828.6	 Can I just respond to that, Jason, real quick?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5830.4s	5830.4	 Yes, you can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5831.4s	5831.4	 Look, look, I, you know, I wrote a blog post, but going back to April 1st,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5834.9s	5834.9	 saying that we should that mass should be the policy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5837.4s	5837.4	 and it should never have become a political issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5839.5s	5839.5	 OK, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5840.7s	5840.7	 It should have been a bipartisan response.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5842.9s	5842.9	 And it's unfortunate it became a political issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5846.3s	5846.3	 But and I'm not forgiving that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5849.6s	5849.6	 And it took Trump way too long to get on board with mass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5852.4s	5852.4	 I think right around the time my blog was published a few days afterwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5855.5s	5855.5	 First, he said it was optional.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5857.5s	5857.5	 You can do it if you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5858.5s	5858.5	 It took him about another three months to actually say that mass were a good idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5862.3s	5862.3	 I agree that had he just gone all in on a mass policy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5865.9s	5865.9	 I think this would not even be a close election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5868.8s	5868.8	 I mean, that was probably the single biggest blunder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5871.7s	5871.7	 that he made politically this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5874.0s	5874.0	 100 percent agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5875.1s	5875.1	 OK, so we agree on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5876.3s	5876.3	 But but but look, but you're missing the other half of it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5879.3s	5879.3	 which is what is our covid policy going to be today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5882.3s	5882.3	 And the reality is that Joe Biden and all these blue state governors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5885.9s	5885.9	 are still on the record as being in favor of lockdowns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5889.1s	5889.1	 And in fact, they are doing lockdowns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5891.1s	5891.1	 The only reason why Michigan and Wisconsin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5894.3s	5894.3	 but I say especially Michigan would ever be in play tonight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5897.4s	5897.4	 was because of lockdowns. Absolutely agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5900.4s	5900.4	 Yes, this is a resounding rebuke of lockdowns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5904.8s	5904.8	 Let's just zip through these real quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5906.5s	5906.5	 Arizona, pull it up, Nick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5908.7s	5908.7	 Arizona, here we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5910.5s	5910.5	 Biden, 54 percent, if we round up 45 for Donald Trump, seventy five percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5915.9s	5915.9	 Looks like Arizona is going to Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5919.9s	5919.9	 Next up, let's take a quick look at Iowa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5925.7s	5925.7	 Iowa, 64 percent in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5927.8s	5927.8	 And we're in essentially a dead heat with. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5931.6s	5931.6	 I was going to Trump, Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5933.3s	5933.3	 I was going to Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5934.3s	5934.3	 You can see how that numbers come down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5936.3s	5936.3	 Yeah. As as the election day vote starts to trickle in, that's going to try.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5940.7s	5940.7	 So they were one of the states that did the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5944.7s	5944.7	 drop off ballots, mail in ballots first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5946.6s	5946.6	 Yes, I think I think that's fair to say. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5948.9s	5948.9	 OK. Ohio, critically important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5950.9s	5950.9	 Let's take a look at Ohio while we're here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5954.3s	5954.3	 Ohio. Wow. That's really flipped hard with a commanding lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5959.2s	5959.2	 Yeah. You can kiss that one goodbye.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5961.3s	5961.3	 Yeah. Ohio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5962.5s	5962.5	 Ohio is done. Just to be clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5964.1s	5964.1	 North Carolina.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5965.6s	5965.6	 We are now within one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5966.9s	5966.9	 And we just all agree if we were, I mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5970.6s	5970.6	 All right. If we're momentum investors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5973.7s	5973.7	 I mean, this thing is this is a disaster for Biden right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5977.3s	5977.3	 It's a disaster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5978.2s	5978.2	 This is a disaster for Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5979.9s	5979.9	 And on top of this, all our talk is about the presidency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5984.1s	5984.1	 They're not going to get the Senate either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5986.0s	5986.0	 Now, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5987.6s	5987.6	 Tillis is running ahead of Trump in North Carolina.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5990.8s	5990.8	 So I think he's home free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5992.2s	5992.2	 And while the vote in Maine is not fully in yet, there's only about 41 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5996.5s	5996.5	 Collins has a 40,000 vote lead, which is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=5999.5s	5999.5	 Susan Collins keeps her seat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6001.5s	6001.5	 That is the biggest that that is like the mega upset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6005.6s	6005.6	 The Democrats were already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6007.6s	6007.6	 They were targeting her two years ago after she voted for Kavanaugh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6011.5s	6011.5	 Yeah. OK. The best.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6014.3s	6014.3	 As we go through this, by the way, just keep this in mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6016.5s	6016.5	 CNN right now shows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6018.8s	6018.8	 I mean, I don't I CNN said must be up their ass or we don't know what we're doing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6022.1s	6022.1	 but they show one ninety two to one fourteen Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6026.3s	6026.3	 Well, yeah, because they call it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6027.3s	6027.3	 They call it California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6028.4s	6028.4	 That's right. They called California when the polls closed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6030.9s	6030.9	 So that's 55. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6033.2s	6033.2	 OK. North Carolina. Here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6036.7s	6036.7	 We were we did North Carolina, I believe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6039.1s	6039.1	 Yeah. We're at 95 percent reporting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6041.7s	6041.7	 And Trump has a lead that looks like he's. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6045.0s	6045.0	 Unless there's a lot of Charlotte out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6046.8s	6046.8	 I think that North Carolina is over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6048.4s	6048.4	 And that, by the way, that percentage is outside the recount
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6052.6s	6052.6	 window. I think you have to be within one percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6054.9s	6054.9	 OK, let's take a look at Georgia for a quick second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6057.1s	6057.1	 We said that was weird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6058.1s	6058.1	 Michael, you know, if we've counted North Carolina's mail in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6062.3s	6062.3	 I think that I think they were all dumped at the outset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6065.5s	6065.5	 North Carolina.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6066.4s	6066.4	 One of the reasons why we were watching them tonight is that like Florida,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6069.9s	6069.9	 they can count in advance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6071.7s	6071.7	 And so they dumped.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6073.4s	6073.4	 They dumped a bunch right at the outset here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6076.0s	6076.0	 By the way, I just got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6077.1s	6077.1	 By the way, I just checked the betting lines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6078.8s	6078.8	 Trump is over three to one favorite to win the election right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6082.1s	6082.1	 Later, the later it goes, the more significant that is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6085.8s	6085.8	 Wait, why did it come down to 200 on Bavado?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6088.0s	6088.0	 That's the lowest it's been.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6090.1s	6090.1	 Well, that's interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6091.2s	6091.2	 I just got three to one on one of the sides.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6093.7s	6093.7	 This is two to one. Yeah, that's a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6096.5s	6096.5	 You better start arming these sites.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6098.6s	6098.6	 If you assume that Biden takes Arizona,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6101.7s	6101.7	 Trump takes North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6106.9s	6106.9	 Let's go to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6108.2s	6108.2	 Let's give him pencil.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6109.3s	6109.3	 Biden wins Arizona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6111.5s	6111.5	 If Biden wins Arizona, he could lose Michigan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6115.5s	6115.5	 So Georgia is still the 54 percent just declared that Biden won Arizona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6121.2s	6121.2	 Oh, well, OK, that's a quick call.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6124.3s	6124.3	 I don't buy it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6125.3s	6125.3	 I just take Pennsylvania.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6127.3s	6127.3	 OK, so now this is what I'm saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6128.5s	6128.5	 This is why this is in place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6129.5s	6129.5	 So if you assume Biden takes Arizona, so that's now on the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6133.0s	6133.0	 Now, if you say that Trump takes North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6136.7s	6136.7	 Pennsylvania, Florida, Texas, Ohio, et cetera, he still needs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6141.9s	6141.9	 To pull out a victory in Michigan, Wisconsin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6145.1s	6145.1	 or Minnesota, otherwise, get this or Nevada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6148.5s	6148.5	 Well, actually, Nevada wouldn't be enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6150.0s	6150.0	 Nevada would be enough. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6151.6s	6151.6	 Otherwise, let's go to Minnesota.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6153.4s	6153.4	 I saw the guys. Hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6154.4s	6154.4	 Just let me finish, please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6155.6s	6155.6	 It's going to be if Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6157.4s	6157.4	 So if that happens, Trump needs to win one of Michigan, Wisconsin or Minnesota.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6160.8s	6160.8	 Otherwise, it's 270 to 68 Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6165.1s	6165.1	 Wow. OK, so here's Minnesota.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6167.5s	6167.5	 Let's just pause for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6168.9s	6168.9	 Biden with Biden's got a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6172.5s	6172.5	 56 percent to 42 with 54 percent in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6176.5s	6176.5	 So there's a lot more to come in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6178.4s	6178.4	 But I think, Michael, you would agree that's a bridge too far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6181.7s	6181.7	 I never thought Minnesota was in play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6184.0s	6184.0	 The Republicans, the Republicans put a brave face on there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6187.3s	6187.3	 and they are making some gains in the rural areas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6189.3s	6189.3	 But Minnesota was never in play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6190.9s	6190.9	 OK, time to go to Wisconsin. Time to go to Wisconsin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6193.7s	6193.7	 Let's take a let's pause here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6195.2s	6195.2	 We got to do this step by step, everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6197.1s	6197.1	 Wisconsin, 51 percent to 47 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6200.1s	6200.1	 Donald Trump with 54 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6202.4s	6202.4	 That, too, I think feels like a bridge too far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6204.7s	6204.7	 Or do we not know if they did?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6206.1s	6206.1	 We don't. Oh, you know, I think Wisconsin is another one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6208.9s	6208.9	 who's probably counted their election day vote first. So no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6213.5s	6213.5	 So Biden is still very much alive in Wisconsin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6215.9s	6215.9	 Yeah, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6216.7s	6216.7	 Milwaukee doesn't come in until tomorrow morning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6219.1s	6219.1	 Yeah. Michigan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6220.1s	6220.1	 We need to take a quick look at Michigan and then we're almost done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6224.4s	6224.4	 OK, here's Michigan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6225.6s	6225.6	 Donald Trump at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6227.9s	6227.9	 trending to 55 percent to 44 percent for Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6231.0s	6231.0	 Only 44 percent are in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6233.7s	6233.7	 And let's be clear, is this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6235.9s	6235.9	 Detroit doesn't come in until tomorrow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6238.5s	6238.5	 OK, is that Michigan?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6239.7s	6239.7	 Detroit doesn't. Yeah, that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6241.1s	6241.1	 And that Wayne County vote is very low.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6243.5s	6243.5	 Yeah. Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6244.4s	6244.4	 Twenty eight percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6246.0s	6246.0	 A lot of more a lot more votes there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6248.6s	6248.6	 OK, so we don't know about Michigan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6250.3s	6250.3	 Michigan is very much up in the air.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6252.0s	6252.0	 That's a that's a pretty good margin for Trump there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6254.0s	6254.0	 But I would say it's very much up in the air.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6255.5s	6255.5	 But by the way, if you put Arizona in Biden's column, he can lose Michigan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6260.6s	6260.6	 Let's take a look at Pennsylvania one more time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6262.5s	6262.5	 Actually, and Tramath is right, he could lose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6264.2s	6264.2	 He could lose either Michigan or Pennsylvania and still he could have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6267.7s	6267.7	 Trump needs to win Michigan, Wisconsin, one of Michigan, Wisconsin or Minnesota.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6272.0s	6272.0	 So basically, forget Minnesota.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6274.8s	6274.8	 If Detroit so so then if Detroit doesn't show up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6278.1s	6278.1	 and Milwaukee and Green Bay don't show up, Trump wins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6281.4s	6281.4	 Pennsylvania.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6282.8s	6282.8	 But Tramath, does that assume that he wins Pennsylvania?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6286.8s	6286.8	 Yes, if I give you if we give him Pennsylvania.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6289.0s	6289.0	 So again, this is why I think, guys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6294.0s	6294.0	 it feels like Biden, as I said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6297.7s	6297.7	 I'm a little shaky on my prediction right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6299.7s	6299.7	 Yeah, I think the the betting markets are showing it's tightened almost to even.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6304.8s	6304.8	 And let me ask Brad a question, Brad, if the betting markets are saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6307.7s	6307.7	 it's almost even in the analysis, we just did isn't missing any information.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6311.3s	6311.3	 Yeah. Why are the futures markets still trading up one and a half points?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6315.6s	6315.6	 And why are things still?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6316.7s	6316.7	 You know, I think that listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6319.7s	6319.7	 the the the stock markets ripped the last two days,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6323.5s	6323.5	 assuming that Biden's going to win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6325.9s	6325.9	 And I think what the markets are starting to price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6331.2s	6331.2	 in is that this is not going to be a blue wave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6335.3s	6335.3	 There's no mandate here for massive tax reform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6338.7s	6338.7	 There's going to be a divided Senate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6340.4s	6340.4	 It's going to be hard to pass legislation that's going to be overly onerous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6345.1s	6345.1	 that the stimulus package is going to be smaller, not larger,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6348.5s	6348.5	 which is why the rates are backing up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6351.2s	6351.2	 So I think from a I think from a public markets perspective,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6355.5s	6355.5	 the idea that we're going to have some checks and balances in place,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6359.0s	6359.0	 it can live with either the the devil we know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6364.0s	6364.0	 or it can live with Biden, but it doesn't want Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6367.2s	6367.2	 with Elizabeth Warren as Treasury Secretary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6369.7s	6369.7	 So democracy survives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6371.9s	6371.9	 I think scenario three is starting to look very possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6375.0s	6375.0	 Biden and a Republican Senate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6376.4s	6376.4	 And I can sleep soundly with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6379.7s	6379.7	 OK, so we're going to have to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6381.8s	6381.8	 I mean, you guys, I don't know what you're looking at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6383.8s	6383.8	 But but I mean, one point nine is I mean, that's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6387.0s	6387.0	 that's a huge significant right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6389.1s	6389.1	 Well, it's still good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6390.8s	6390.8	 I give you that. But I don't know those those numbers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6395.1s	6395.1	 And Phil, it's moving fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6398.2s	6398.2	 I want to I want to take it down to 180.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6400.3s	6400.3	 Yeah, I want to go back to this topic that we brought up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6405.4s	6405.4	 OK, guys, look, we'll have a winner and it's going to be close.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6411.0s	6411.0	 But think of how many people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6415.2s	6415.2	 like isn't there any empathy for all these people that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6417.7s	6417.7	 that just feel so completely shut out of the system?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6420.0s	6420.0	 Like, what do we do tomorrow?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6423.0s	6423.0	 Like irrespective actually of whether Trump wins or Biden wins,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6425.9s	6425.9	 I think Brad's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6426.7s	6426.7	 We're going to basically get, you know, nothing much is going to happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6429.9s	6429.9	 at that level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6431.0s	6431.0	 But what do we do at the like on Main Street?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6433.3s	6433.3	 Like, what are we doing to close the gap between folks so that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6437.3s	6437.3	 you know, this entire cohort, like literally, I don't care
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6440.7s	6440.7	 whether Biden wins by the popular vote by five million or seven million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6444.6s	6444.6	 You're talking about tens of millions of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6448.7s	6448.7	 Bill Gurley is now on the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6450.9s	6450.9	 Another one of our besties, Bill, thanks for joining us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6453.5s	6453.5	 You heard the question being teed up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6455.7s	6455.7	 This is neck and neck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6457.5s	6457.5	 This is not something anybody, at least pollsters,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6461.0s	6461.0	 came anywhere close to predicting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6463.3s	6463.3	 And Chemaad's question, I think, is a really valid one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6466.1s	6466.1	 Who has got a greater chance of bringing the country back together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6470.9s	6470.9	 and maybe leading from the middle and maybe healing this wound?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6474.8s	6474.8	 Because this has been the worst four years, I believe, in any of our lifetimes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6479.4s	6479.4	 in terms of the anxiety and the anger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6482.8s	6482.8	 between people who used to be able to get a lot of question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6486.7s	6486.7	 Only I want to know Bill's opinion, because, by the way, Bill Gurley,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6491.0s	6491.0	 it's the best VC, Jason, Jason, Bill Gurley
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6494.2s	6494.2	 is the best venture capitalist in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6496.7s	6496.7	 Phil, Phil, stop hijacking our fucking broadcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6500.6s	6500.6	 Go ahead, Gurley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6501.7s	6501.7	 So thanks for having me on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6503.3s	6503.3	 I, you know, I think you guys have done a really good job of breaking down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6507.5s	6507.5	 why people have misestimated this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6511.0s	6511.0	 There was a, you know, there's such a rural urban split.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6514.5s	6514.5	 There was a really good New York Times Daily podcast about two weeks ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6518.5s	6518.5	 where they interviewed rural Democrats in Pennsylvania that had switched to Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6525.0s	6525.0	 And all the voices they echoed were very similar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6528.1s	6528.1	 to what Brad walked through with his mother.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6530.3s	6530.3	 And so I do think there's a true lack of empathy for the center states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6535.5s	6535.5	 in the rural areas from the coastal elites.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6538.6s	6538.6	 And I'd say part of breaking any of it down would be somehow trying to separate that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6543.9s	6543.9	 I think a bigger issue that has really been on my mind lately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6548.4s	6548.4	 is just how tribal everyone's gotten.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6550.5s	6550.5	 And I've come to believe that the way you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6556.0s	6556.0	 probably just ruin your mind the most is to just join a tribe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6559.6s	6559.6	 and quit thinking about things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6561.2s	6561.2	 And the number of people I know on both sides
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6564.9s	6564.9	 that have run off to their tribe is shocking to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6568.8s	6568.8	 And it's just not a way to go about being smart
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6572.5s	6572.5	 because, you know, and if you anyone that makes fun of a, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6578.5s	6578.5	 a religion that's extreme or something, it's all the same shit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6581.6s	6581.6	 Like you're just believing dogma for the sake of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6584.0s	6584.0	 So I one of the things that I worry about about a Trump victory is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6588.5s	6588.5	 is just very tactically in my life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6591.0s	6591.0	 And maybe it's part of living in California, but a whole bunch of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6594.8s	6594.8	 and things that I want to get solved, become more manic if he wins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6599.5s	6599.5	 Like my kids school and the companies that I work with and and COVID,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6604.5s	6604.5	 quite frankly, I think that we can't get past COVID with Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6608.5s	6608.5	 because the TDS are so convinced that it has to be problematic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6613.6s	6613.6	 And it's just, you know, so I don't I actually I don't know the exact path
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6617.7s	6617.7	 to solve it, but I I do worry about just being in a world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6621.9s	6621.9	 where everyone hates each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6623.9s	6623.9	 And it just doesn't seem solvable that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6627.5s	6627.5	 Well, this is why I think, you know, this this scenario, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6632.5s	6632.5	 we've called the soft landing, where let's say you had a Biden victory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6636.2s	6636.2	 by two electoral votes, the Republicans hold on to the Senate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6640.1s	6640.1	 I think the radical left gets a big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6643.0s	6643.0	 I'd say rebuke or a shock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6645.9s	6645.9	 And we have basically divided government in Washington,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6649.2s	6649.2	 but it takes the whole temperature down because, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6651.9s	6651.9	 Trump gets replaced by Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6653.3s	6653.3	 But you've kind of got, you know, basically Joe and his old pal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6657.0s	6657.0	 Mitch are in a power sharing arrangement in Washington.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6659.6s	6659.6	 It could be a really good situation for the country for the next four years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6663.6s	6663.6	 You know, temperature would go down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6665.0s	6665.0	 That'd be kind of this, you know, healing process, if you will.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6669.2s	6669.2	 But, you know, there wouldn't be a whole lot of new sort of legislation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6673.1s	6673.1	 that we have to worry about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6674.3s	6674.3	 I think we would get what we want, which is the ability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6677.0s	6677.0	 to ignore Washington for four years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6679.5s	6679.5	 Yeah, but we wouldn't get a solution to really what ails us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6682.2s	6682.2	 which is the fact that there's all these people that just feel completely shut out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6686.9s	6686.9	 And that really bothers me at some very basic level, which is like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6691.6s	6691.6	 I just think like, you know, I fought my family, my parents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6696.9s	6696.9	 Just escape some third world fucking shithole to go to Canada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6701.5s	6701.5	 And, you know, Canada gave us a lot, but it still wasn't enough for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6705.4s	6705.4	 I crawled and scratched to get into the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6708.3s	6708.3	 Things work out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6709.6s	6709.6	 But I don't feel like I have a right to all of a sudden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6715.5s	6715.5	 I don't know, just like look down on other people or make people feel like shit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6720.1s	6720.1	 or not allow people to actually think, Shemoff, that Biden is going to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6724.1s	6724.1	 Or do you think Biden's going to know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6725.5s	6725.5	 But Jason, I think the middle ground, no, who who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6728.6s	6728.6	 know, with the Republicans in the Senate and the.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6731.4s	6731.4	 No, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6732.2s	6732.2	 What I'm saying is independent of what happens, we're going to have basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6735.3s	6735.3	 we're going to have a photo finish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6738.4s	6738.4	 And what I think what Brad said is right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6741.3s	6741.3	 The fact that we are in a photo finish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6744.5s	6744.5	 means that there are a lot of people in pain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6747.7s	6747.7	 And I think we have a responsibility to get our heads out of our asses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6753.4s	6753.4	 And stop this sanctimonious, holier than thou bullshit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6756.3s	6756.3	 I agree with Brad when he says that it really hits a nerve with me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6759.9s	6759.9	 because I feel like there are a lot of people we work with them all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6762.9s	6762.9	 It's right within the tech culture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6765.2s	6765.2	 And all these fuck bags think they know what they're talking about all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6768.5s	6768.5	 And we're doing a disservice to so many Americans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6771.9s	6771.9	 And we need to wake up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6772.9s	6772.9	 And that's what bothers me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6774.0s	6774.0	 The idea that there are so many people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6777.1s	6777.1	 who feel like they're just getting so fucked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6781.3s	6781.3	 Really bothers me. That bothers me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6784.0s	6784.0	 So I can ignore Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6786.1s	6786.1	 I'll ignore his bullshit, because honestly, he's done nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6790.1s	6790.1	 He will do nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6791.4s	6791.4	 He is a complete fucking void.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6793.9s	6793.9	 But whether it's Trump or Biden in a 270, 268 election,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6798.2s	6798.2	 the fact that so many people still use this guy as a vessel,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6802.7s	6802.7	 I don't know, that makes that makes me more upset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6805.0s	6805.0	 I think some people I think everyone thinks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6808.4s	6808.4	 has some degree of empathy to the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6811.1s	6811.1	 I think there are different points of view on the solution,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6813.3s	6813.3	 which is where this stuff gets realized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6815.3s	6815.3	 The one point of view is we should have less government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6817.4s	6817.4	 involved in our lives and our businesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6818.9s	6818.9	 And the other point of view is we should have more support and help
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6822.6s	6822.6	 from the government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6823.7s	6823.7	 And that's where things diverge very quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6827.0s	6827.0	 It doesn't feel to me like anyone in politics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6830.9s	6830.9	 is necessarily ignoring what you're highlighting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6833.3s	6833.3	 And I don't think anyone in America does from the rich to the poor,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6835.9s	6835.9	 to the left, to the right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6837.8s	6837.8	 I think the solutions are miscast, because, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6840.5s	6840.5	 what are we supposed to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6842.3s	6842.3	 like with our higher educational institutions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6844.5s	6844.5	 the people that are churning out all these folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6847.0s	6847.0	 that are meant to go and collaborate and find middle ground?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6850.5s	6850.5	 I mean, I clearly like all of this says our educational facilities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6853.8s	6853.8	 are completely failing from grade school all the way through to high school,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6859.6s	6859.6	 community college, college, grad school.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6862.0s	6862.0	 It's all just a contrived piece of shit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6865.3s	6865.3	 Right. We are completely putting out one in two people for failure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6870.3s	6870.3	 OK, so that much is clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6872.2s	6872.2	 So I don't see politicians fixing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6875.7s	6875.7	 On either side of the aisle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6877.3s	6877.3	 What I mean, honestly, what are we supposed to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6879.5s	6879.5	 Well, I mean, might I just might I just suggest that two things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6886.9s	6886.9	 Number one, I think in these results that you see, there's a,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6890.9s	6890.9	 you know, there is extraordinary frustration, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6895.1s	6895.1	 With this with the state of affairs, the fact that Trump in the middle of Covid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6901.4s	6901.4	 After four years of torturous anxiety, inducing tweets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6905.2s	6905.2	 Could even be in a neck to neck race to win this election tells you, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6910.9s	6910.9	 How devastatingly bad people feel about how they're how they're being treated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6916.2s	6916.2	 I think that, you know, I said recently, we have to redraft the social contract.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6921.2s	6921.2	 This idea we've been living under social contract drafted post World War Two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6927.4s	6927.4	 That, you know, it's pre technology revolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6930.1s	6930.1	 We have a concentration of wealth today in the world and in this country,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6933.6s	6933.6	 like we've never seen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6934.7s	6934.7	 And we have Republicans that are set in their ways who say, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6939.9s	6939.9	 no, no, no universal health care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6943.9s	6943.9	 You know, no reform of the education system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6946.1s	6946.1	 You have Democrats who are demanding that you have universal basic income.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6950.0s	6950.0	 I think you have to have pragmatic, smart, younger politics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6956.0s	6956.0	 I mean, the fact that we have two old white men.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6959.4s	6959.4	 I mean, neither of these folks is on top of their game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6964.4s	6964.4	 I mean, neither of these like this is, I mean, you can you compare Biden to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6969.1s	6969.1	 Pete Buttigieg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6971.1s	6971.1	 I mean, Buttigieg is Buttigieg walks into the lion's den of Fox TV and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6978.0s	6978.0	 tames the lion every night, every night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6983.0s	6983.0	
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6983.0s	6983.0	 Let's get Pete Buttigieg solving some of these problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6986.9s	6986.9	 Let's get some younger ideas on the Republican side solving these problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6989.9s	6989.9	 But we're going to have to rearchitect that social contract.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6993.9s	6993.9	 No doubt about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=6995.9s	6995.9	 You know, and I think the second thing is that, you know, to me, this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7001.9s	7001.9	 going to be a wake up call to the nominating processes in both parties.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7006.9s	7006.9	 But let's be clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7007.9s	7007.9	 Mike Pence, right, has his road map.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7011.9s	7011.9	 You know, for, you know, how to win the election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7014.9s	7014.9	 Indiana governor, right, who's going to tap into the same fears that Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7019.9s	7019.9	 tapped into.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7020.9s	7020.9	 I mean, these fears aren't going away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7023.9s	7023.9	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7024.9s	7024.9	 The exact the exacerbation of the wealth disparity is going to increase,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7027.9s	7027.9	 not decrease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7028.9s	7028.9	 We see it every day out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7029.9s	7029.9	 And so I think you're going to have to have, you know, the Democratic Party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7034.9s	7034.9	 who nominates people, puts people in the same position as you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7039.9s	7039.9	 You know, who can, you know, who can tap into this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7042.9s	7042.9	 Brad, who do you like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7043.9s	7043.9	 If it wasn't Biden, who would you like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7045.9s	7045.9	 Buttigieg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7047.9s	7047.9	 Buttigieg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7048.9s	7048.9	 He's a South.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7049.9s	7049.9	 This was the, you know, an openly gay mayor of my hometown in Indiana.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7057.9s	7057.9	 You think he can sell?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7058.9s	7058.9	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7059.9s	7059.9	 Who fought, who fought in Afghanistan and who goes on Fox News every damn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7065.9s	7065.9	 night, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7067.8s	7067.8	 And has a conversation that leaves Republicans saying, oh, that guy's pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7072.8s	7072.8	 smart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7073.8s	7073.8	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7074.8s	7074.8	 Yeah, I agree that he is a tremendous political talent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7077.8s	7077.8	 Do you think that he's pragmatic enough, Brad, or he's he would he would end up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7081.8s	7081.8	 veering more towards a, you know, sort of like politically correct leftist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7087.8s	7087.8	 socialist agenda and then have the same result?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7091.8s	7091.8	 I think that there is a there's been a doctrine in the in the Democratic Party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7096.8s	7096.8	 that to win the primary, you got to veer to the left, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7099.8s	7099.8	 You got to contend with Bernie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7102.8s	7102.8	 You got to contend with Elizabeth Warren.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7104.8s	7104.8	 But ultimately, that's a losing strategy in the election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7108.8s	7108.8	 And so I think you're going to have the emergence of a middle of the country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7112.8s	7112.8	 governor, middle of the country mayor, somebody like Pete, who's going to run,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7118.7s	7118.7	 you know, on a smart, younger, pragmatic, democratic ticket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7123.7s	7123.7	 I think that's a winning formula.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7124.7s	7124.7	 I mean, I think that's the Clinton formula.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7127.7s	7127.7	 You know, Obama was a bit of an anomaly, but the Clinton formula was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7132.7s	7132.7	 conservative, pragmatic form of of Democratic Party leadership.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7136.7s	7136.7	 I mean, I suspect that in the next three or four days, I'm going to get a call
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7140.7s	7140.7	 from the Democratic leadership, figuring out how much they can count on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7143.7s	7143.7	 And my message to them is you guys can go fuck yourselves until you figure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7147.7s	7147.7	 this out, because to your point, Brad, it is absolutely shameful that we're in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7153.7s	7153.7	 No, no, I'm serious that we are in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7155.7s	7155.7	 I know you are. That's what I love.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7157.7s	7157.7	 Well, but that's a mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7158.7s	7158.7	 I mean, what you should tell them to do is go form a DLC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7161.7s	7161.7	 Remember the Democrat leadership committee that Bill Clinton formed?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7164.7s	7164.7	 So remember what Bill Clinton did when he won in 92.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7168.7s	7168.7	 We had three straight Republican presidential terms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7171.7s	7171.7	 Ron Reagan, incredibly successful president, then his successor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7175.7s	7175.7	 Basically, Reagan won a Bush won a third term for Reagan, but he was a weak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7179.7s	7179.7	 candidate and Clinton came in there. What did he do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7182.7s	7182.7	 He triangulated. He tacked toward the center.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7185.7s	7185.7	 And, you know, he he actually passed a lot of bipartisan legislation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7190.7s	7190.7	 David, David, David, let me make this even more blunt. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7194.7s	7194.7	 My million bucks will grow to ten million dollars per election to fifty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7198.7s	7198.7	 million dollars per election as I get older. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7201.7s	7201.7	 So these motherfuckers want a single goddamn dollar for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7204.7s	7204.7	 What I want first is a root cause analysis to understand what is actually going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7208.7s	7208.7	 So to your point, before you fix it, you need to be honest and identify the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7213.7s	7213.7	 Well, I mean, I think that I think it's because the issue that Trump ran against
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7219.7s	7219.7	 was that Joe Biden was a Trojan horse for radical for a radical left that really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7227.7s	7227.7	 owns the Democratic Party right now. That's what he ran against.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7230.7s	7230.7	 Bill Gurley, what do you think the issues are that if we were going to try to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7234.7s	7234.7	 a great reconciliation between these two parties, between Middle America and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7239.7s	7239.7	 coastal elites where you have spent, you know, large swaths of your life, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7244.7s	7244.7	 perhaps you're the only person here who has lived in both places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7247.7s	7247.7	 Middle of America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7248.7s	7248.7	 You said he's from Indiana.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7250.7s	7250.7	 OK, but I trust your judgment on these issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7255.7s	7255.7	 What does the what does the what are the coasts need to understand about the people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7260.7s	7260.7	 who believe when we live between the coasts and what they're trying to express to us?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7266.7s	7266.7	 And how can we as coastal occupants and citizens do to kind of bridge this gap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7272.7s	7272.7	 other than just moving to Austin and getting the hell out of California, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7276.7s	7276.7	 devolving, which is what I feel like doing at this point?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7279.7s	7279.7	 Well, I have two comments on this one, you know, having having listened to, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7284.7s	7284.7	 know, as much as I can on all the voter conversations, including this call on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7291.7s	7291.7	 I'm not 100 percent sure that these people feel unrepresented.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7296.7s	7296.7	 I think a lot of them want to be left alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7298.7s	7298.7	 And so part part of what's being engineered or what they fear is being engineered
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7304.7s	7304.7	 is someone sitting in a city with views that are very different than them, telling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7309.7s	7309.7	 them that this is the world they have to live by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7311.7s	7311.7	 And I think the lockdown fit in with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7313.7s	7313.7	 But a lot of other things, too, that the daily podcast I mentioned, you know, there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7318.7s	7318.7	 was this guy just saying, what is what does Nancy Pelosi know about what I want in my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7323.7s	7323.7	 day to day life?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7324.7s	7324.7	 You know, and so there is a notion of being left alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7327.7s	7327.7	 Brad's story about his mom was like, hey, we're fine here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7331.7s	7331.7	 Like, don't don't bother me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7333.7s	7333.7	 And so there's a there's a difference between trying to solve a problem for them and being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7337.7s	7337.7	 empathetic to their point of view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7340.7s	7340.7	 And and I would say having spent a lot of time in these areas and being a slow talker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7345.7s	7345.7	 and sometimes made fun of for that, there is a there's unquestionably a a type of social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7354.7s	7354.7	 bias against rural Americans in in urban cities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7358.7s	7358.7	 There's just no doubt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7359.7s	7359.7	 It's the only joke you're allowed to tell without getting rebuked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7363.7s	7363.7	 In other words, we can make fun of the rednecks and we can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7367.7s	7367.7	 Oh, absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7368.7s	7368.7	 All day long, all day long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7370.7s	7370.7	 We can do a Bill Gurley impersonation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7373.7s	7373.7	 They're either idiots or they're immoral.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7375.7s	7375.7	 I mean, if we and this is a thing that I don't understand when I grew up and I'm curious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7381.7s	7381.7	 other people's opinions here and I'll let anybody who wants to jump in on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7385.7s	7385.7	 It feels like the lessons I was taught in the 70s and 80s, which were America is strong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7390.7s	7390.7	 because we're a melting pot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7392.7s	7392.7	 We take the best of all the cultures and we try to make our own out of it and that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7397.7s	7397.7	 get to make choices for your life and in your city, town and state that don't have to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7404.7s	7404.7	 the same as the ones we make in New York.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7407.7s	7407.7	 So if you want to have a handgun and you want to put it on your waistband in Texas or wherever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7412.7s	7412.7	 and in New York City, we don't want to have handguns in the city because it's a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7415.7s	7415.7	 bit more crowded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7417.7s	7417.7	 We can we can have that difference and we can coexist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7421.7s	7421.7	 And I don't know when we lost this script that what makes America great is the differences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7427.7s	7427.7	 and that people living in different parts of a very large, diverse country can have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7433.7s	7433.7	 different opinions about, you know, abortion and what month abortion is allowed to occur
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7440.7s	7440.7	 at or the owning of a gun or, you know, how tall a building can be built.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7446.7s	7446.7	 When did that get taken off the table and who took it off the table?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7449.7s	7449.7	 You know, who took it off the table was these hysterical libs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7452.7s	7452.7	 And I think the hysterical as much as this far right Trump, you know, you know, flags
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7460.7s	7460.7	 on pickup trucks surrounding other cars is absolutely horrible to watch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7465.7s	7465.7	 I have equal disdain for hysterical libs trying to tell somebody who lives on a ranch that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7471.7s	7471.7	 they can't have a gun when they've never even been to a goddamn ranch and they've never

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7481.7s	7481.7	 45 minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7483.7s	7483.7	 And that's what America needs to get back to is respecting each other's different lifestyles,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7488.7s	7488.7	 whether you're an atheist or you're devoutly Catholic, Viva la Diference, let people live

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7496.7s	7496.7	 I think it's an astute point, Bill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7498.7s	7498.7	 Hey, J Cal, can we run down California next?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7501.7s	7501.7	 Yeah, I'm very curious how Prop 22 is doing and Prop 22 is ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7506.7s	7506.7	 Bill Gurley.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7512.7s	7512.7	 Bill, can you tell everyone what Prop 22 is and why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7515.7s	7515.7	 Yeah, please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7516.7s	7516.7	 Why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7517.7s	7517.7	 Yeah, and it would transition to a whole bunch of conversations about politics that I feel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7523.7s	7523.7	 more passionate about than who gets elected, which is if, you know, in order to solve the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7530.7s	7530.7	 problems that everyone's upset about with inequality and whatnot, I think you have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7536.7s	7536.7	 have massive innovation and you have to have job growth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7539.7s	7539.7	 And I don't know of any waves in history where you get a whole bunch of improvement in standard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7547.7s	7547.7	 of living for a broad swath of a population without being positively aligned with job

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7553.7s	7553.7	 And where I'm going with this is my biggest concern about Washington, I used to say the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7559.7s	7559.7	 main reasons Silicon Valley works is because it's so fucking far away from D.C.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7564.7s	7564.7	 And it's because regulation is the friend of the incumbent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7569.7s	7569.7	 And it's the opposite of innovation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7571.7s	7571.7	 It locks in things and it's very resistant to change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7575.7s	7575.7	 And Matt Ridley's new book, How Innovation Works, goes through this over a very, very long period
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7582.7s	7582.7	 of time. It's fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7584.7s	7584.7	 And he talks about why Europe's gotten stuck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7586.7s	7586.7	 And like the top 50 market cap companies in Europe, there's no new entrant in 30 years or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7592.7s	7592.7	 something like that because of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7595.7s	7595.7	 Anyway, Prop 22 is a California proposition reaction to a law that was put on the California
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7602.7s	7602.7	 books called AB5.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7604.7s	7604.7	 To the best of my knowledge, and this is consistent with the editorial groups at the LA Times,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7609.7s	7609.7	 the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Diego Tribune, is that it was written entirely by a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7615.7s	7615.7	 union, the SEIU, who has no representation over drivers or gig workers whatsoever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7622.7s	7622.7	 They represent service industry workers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7625.7s	7625.7	 And they would like to represent Uber drivers, but they don't today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7629.7s	7629.7	 And I think about this like a bunch of people living in Nevada trying to pass a law for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7634.7s	7634.7	 citizens of California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7636.7s	7636.7	 Unfortunately, because of regulatory capture, which I think is unfortunate on both sides of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7642.7s	7642.7	 the aisle, the union table through a woman named Lorena Gonzalez is able to get the state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7648.7s	7648.7	 to pass a law that basically targeted gig workers, which was this new job type that has all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7655.7s	7655.7	 these fantastic benefits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7657.7s	7657.7	 Anyway, immediately thereafter, there were several industries that were like, oh, we don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7663.7s	7663.7	 want this for us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7664.7s	7664.7	 So them and their unions and constituents started calling on Sacramento with Lorena
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7669.7s	7669.7	 Gonzalez and carving them out one by one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7673.7s	7673.7	 So by the time AB5 was set to be put in action, there were over 100 industries that had been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7679.7s	7679.7	 carved out because it was a stupid law written just to target a single industry, and it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7685.7s	7685.7	 written with political donor dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7687.7s	7687.7	 Now, in a moment that I would say is completely outside of my realm of what I expected, all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7695.7s	7695.7	 the newspaper, all the editorial boards for all of the major newspapers in California came to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7701.7s	7701.7	 the conclusion that this was a bad law, that this was crony capitalism written with donor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7707.7s	7707.7	 dollars, and they all got behind Prop 22, which is because we have this ballot initiative in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7713.7s	7713.7	 California as a way for the voters to tell Sacramento that they're full of shit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7718.7s	7718.7	 And that looks like what's happening right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7721.7s	7721.7	 Sorry for the long answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7723.7s	7723.7	 No, no, it's a great answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7725.7s	7725.7	 And what's particularly infuriating about this, and listen, you and I are both investors in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7735.7s	7735.7	 companies impacted by this, is that there's a group of people who've been exempted from this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7742.7s	7742.7	 And the list of people exempted all seem to be just slightly more powerful and slightly better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7749.7s	7749.7	 paid salespeople, fishermen, psychologists, surgeons, dentists, engineers, architects, lawyers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7760.7s	7760.7	 et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7761.7s	7761.7	 And if this had passed or if it still does pass because we're only at 15 or 20% of people have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7767.7s	7767.7	 been counted so far, but it's looking like Prop 22 will pass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7771.7s	7771.7	 Well, in one of the businesses I run, Inside.com, we had to tell all of the freelancers we were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7780.7s	7780.7	 hiring who are writers that they would lose their gig work with us because they could only write
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7786.7s	7786.7	 five stories a year or 10 stories a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7789.7s	7789.7	 And Vox, one of the big publishing companies, which is incredibly left-leaning, as left as it gets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7797.7s	7797.7	 they stopped hiring people in California and they fired and laid off all their California freelance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7803.7s	7803.7	 writers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7804.7s	7804.7	 And what this does to people who are doing gig economy, 70% of them are working part-time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7811.7s	7811.7	 Nick, can you go back to, I need to switch topics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7815.7s	7815.7	 Nick, can you go to Georgia, please, for a second?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7817.7s	7817.7	 Little late breaking data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7820.7s	7820.7	 Over 400,000 votes outstanding in Atlanta and the suburbs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7824.7s	7824.7	 How close is Georgia?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7826.7s	7826.7	 Let's see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7828.7s	7828.7	 Oh, my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7830.7s	7830.7	 It's a statistical dead heat if you add back in 400,000 for all Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7834.7s	7834.7	 Now, I'm just saying that's not where it's going to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7837.7s	7837.7	 They won't all be for Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7839.7s	7839.7	 I mean, Atlanta should go 70% Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7843.7s	7843.7	 Oh, sure, it will.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7844.7s	7844.7	 Maybe 75, 80, but I guess he'd have to be 100 or 0 to catch up if I'm reading that right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7852.7s	7852.7	 Anyone here cynical enough to think that there's some operative in these states holding these on purpose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7859.7s	7859.7	 so that they can be the center of importance tomorrow?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7863.7s	7863.7	 No, I just think it's almost midnight on the East Coast and people are tired and they're going to go home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7869.7s	7869.7	 and have a shit shower and a shave and start again tomorrow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7872.7s	7872.7	 The reason Gurley is so successful, he always knows how to diagnose the individual motivation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7879.7s	7879.7	 and he can diagnose the shit out of it by just thinking about what one guy's motive is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7885.7s	7885.7	 and then he's figured the whole thing out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7887.7s	7887.7	 He makes a billion dollars over and over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7889.7s	7889.7	 Master of self-interest, Bill Gurley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7891.7s	7891.7	 Here's what it comes down to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7894.7s	7894.7	 So Trump needs to win two out of four of these states, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin or Michigan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7901.7s	7901.7	 And he's got to win two of those four.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7905.7s	7905.7	 So it's got to be probably Pennsylvania and Michigan or Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7911.7s	7911.7	 But he's got to win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7912.7s	7912.7	 If he loses Nevada, he needs to win two out of those three Rust Belt states or he wins Nevada plus like a Pennsylvania.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7921.7s	7921.7	 This is going to be really Michigan is going to go to Trump is going to come down to Pennsylvania
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7928.7s	7928.7	 and really to the to the Philly suburbs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7932.7s	7932.7	 I was reading on Twitter, election official in Michigan says don't expect results before Friday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7940.7s	7940.7	 That's crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7941.7s	7941.7	 Well, by the way, I mean, so let's just think for a second how extraordinary it is that Trump looks like he might win Michigan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7948.7s	7948.7	 I mean, just to go back to the theory of the case that we were laying out earlier about how China
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7956.7s	7956.7	 about how Trump picked up this this China trade issue four years ago and and this this time he combined it with the lockdown issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7965.7s	7965.7	 I mean, it's really amazing that that state is leaning Trump right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7971.7s	7971.7	 Michigan. Michigan was two issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7973.7s	7973.7	 It was, you know, working class Democrats feeling like Trump standing up for them with respect to China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7982.7s	7982.7	 And it was locked down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7983.7s	7983.7	 Lockdown was an overwhelming issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7987.7s	7987.7	 You know, for my for my friends and my folks in Michigan, for sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7991.7s	7991.7	 Can we go back to Prop 22 for a second, Jason?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=7994.7s	7994.7	 Because I think that this is, you know, this is a an issue of extreme importance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8003.7s	8003.7	 You know, one of the things that Bill didn't say is, you know, we're talking earlier, Chamath brought up, you know, what's the third way?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8011.7s	8011.7	 You know, we we've we've built a social contract on the back of kind of W2 tied employment for the better part of the last 70 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8022.7s	8022.7	 We now have a massive part of the economy that's gig.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8025.7s	8025.7	 And it's not just this is all freelancers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8028.7s	8028.7	 This is all part time workers and post covid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8031.7s	8031.7	 This is just a massive portion of the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8033.7s	8033.7	 The idea that we're going to tie all benefits to W2 is just totally asinine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8038.7s	8038.7	 It's got to be re-architected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8040.7s	8040.7	 And what Prop 22 does is say it's IC plus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8047.7s	8047.7	 It's independent contractor plus benefits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8051.7s	8051.7	 Right. It's this idea that we don't have to tie benefits to W2 employment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8057.7s	8057.7	 Right. So the nonsensical no argument against Prop 22.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8062.7s	8062.7	 This was an abandonment of the employee is just that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8067.7s	8067.7	 It combines flexibility with benefits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8071.7s	8071.7	 And, you know, from my perspective, you're going to see if Prop 22 passes, which I think it will tonight, it's going to be the architecture that New York and many other states follow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8083.7s	8083.7	 They're certainly not going to follow the disastrous AB five example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8088.7s	8088.7	 But we also know that it's not sufficient just to have a bunch of workers with zero health care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8096.7s	8096.7	 And, you know, and so I think this is a, you know, hats off to door dash, Instacart, you know, Uber and Lyft trying to trying to design something that is a middle way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8108.7s	8108.7	 And, you know, Chamath, if we don't have politicians designing a middle way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8112.7s	8112.7	 Right. Then we need leadership out of the business community design in a middle way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8118.7s	8118.7	 Well, that so you just said something so so profound and I was going to I would like to build on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8124.7s	8124.7	 I think what California shows is that if you have a completely democratic up and down ticket and it veers too far to this coastal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8134.7s	8134.7	 naval gazing socialist nanny state, then it requires money and companies to basically level the playing field because the Republicans can't do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8145.7s	8145.7	 And it's possible to fight back. And what's interesting to me is nobody ever talks about or maybe they do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8155.7s	8155.7	 And I just don't hear it about how the equivalent happens on the right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8160.7s	8160.7	 It'd be interesting to know if you guys know of any states where that's just Republican up and down the ticket and they just veer into such a detached laissez faire where the whole state needs to get corrected by for profit organizations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8173.7s	8173.7	 But it seems like we're setting up for Democrats versus companies and people moving to Republican states to have low taxes and to be left alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8182.7s	8182.7	 Well, you know, it's a sensible set of outcomes in California, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8186.7s	8186.7	 I mean, do you guys not agree that the the yes on Prop 22 and sacks it looks like your commercial property tax proposition that Zuck helped fund may not pass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8198.7s	8198.7	 It's a thank us. It's a yes. We don't know. It's a point one percent differential.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8203.7s	8203.7	 Yes, I agree. It's looked at California ballot initiatives are looking really good right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8208.7s	8208.7	 It gives me a lot of hope. It gives me a lot of hope about the state because the most anti economic the most let's put a business on friendly ballot initiatives looks like they're going down starting with the win on Prop 22.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8220.7s	8220.7	 That's huge. But then Prop 15, you know, we talked about that on a former episode of the all in pod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8226.7s	8226.7	 This was chipping away at Prop 13, which is the great shield of the middle class in terms of property taxes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8233.7s	8233.7	 I'm not saying you couldn't get a better tax regime that would tax commercial property fair market value, but you sure wouldn't want to give that card away without demanding some structural reform in exchange for it, which is why I thought it was just so stupid for, you know, tech billionaires to be funding, you know, these these ballot initiatives for higher taxes, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8254.7s	8254.7	 This is definitely looking like a like a sensible kind of middle ground outcome where a lot of folks who were concerned about California swinging all the way left and chasing business and enterprise out of the state, you know, maybe kind of getting reeled in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8267.7s	8267.7	 And I think it gives some hope and give some pause to a lot of folks who are trying to build businesses in California to recognize that, you know, hey, there is a thoughtful populace here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8277.7s	8277.7	 Totally agree. And this is this is a great opportunity to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8281.7s	8281.7	 I agree. If this sticks, it's it is because the big the big issue with California right now is that we've got, you know, people we've got net migration out of the state because it's just so hard for the middle class to live here and to build businesses here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8304.7s	8304.7	 I hope what we hear, you know, if we're fortunate enough for Prop 22 to pass, I hear we I hope we see a coalition among these companies come together and really promote this as a national architecture for a third way for independent contractors, free agents across the country to have a living wage and benefits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8330.7s	8330.7	 It's totally detached from W-2 employment. I really do believe a bunch of people on this call were helpful to an effort I launched around the board challenge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8341.7s	8341.7	 You know, it's high time for the social consciousness of corporate America to take the leadership position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8346.7s	8346.7	 And because it's not coming out of Washington and there's so many issues that the solution lies among us and we got to stop spending our election nights wondering when somebody is going to deliver us from ourselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8359.7s	8359.7	 We got to start delivering ourselves. I think it's a very bad unions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8365.7s	8365.7	 I mean, like, you know, girlies girl, are you still with us? Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8370.7s	8370.7	 How do you resolve things with the unions after this? I mean, if Prop 22 passes, is there a coming to the middle ground with unions and are unions always just kind of directional vector?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8383.7s	8383.7	 You know, they're always like a force on the system. They're not an absolute or objective, right? They're they're just always pushing in one direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8390.7s	8390.7	 I mean, what ends up happening with the resolution with unions or is it just a constant back and forth to try and manage the impact they'll have on policy, politics, tax, free market, etc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8401.7s	8401.7	 So from my point of view, if you think about Citizens United, which a lot of people were upset about, I think rightfully so, because DC is so money oriented, like it's coin operated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8415.7s	8415.7	 And a lot of people have vivid awareness of it being court coin operated on the right through corporations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8423.7s	8423.7	 This is why the most heavily regulated industries are the hardest to break into hardest to innovate against.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8429.7s	8429.7	 What I think they miss is how much of its right is is is regulatory capture on the left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8435.7s	8435.7	 And the difference that a union has versus a company is it's a natural monopoly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8440.7s	8440.7	 And so it actually has more power to write regulation than a company does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8446.7s	8446.7	 And it's going to be around every single election cycle. So if you listen to them, you know, you get what you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8453.7s	8453.7	 And the people have pointed out that the the gentleman or he's not a gentleman, the individual that that it killed George Floyd probably wouldn't have been on the force if it weren't for the union protecting him because of the stuff he had done before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8470.7s	8470.7	 But and this goes back to the red and blue and blindness of just being dogmatic to your party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8475.7s	8475.7	 Most of the people I know that are heavily prescribed to the to the Democratic tribe refuse to acknowledge that one of the big problems in police reform comes from the unions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8488.7s	8488.7	 And you can't see those things unless you take yourself out of that single place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8494.7s	8494.7	 I would tell you the California situation I think is deeper than than maybe what Brad talked about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8499.7s	8499.7	 The rule, the law that's causing more companies to leave from my perspective than AB five is something called Paga, which was passed about 25 years ago, but it's finally reached momentum where it's causing problems for companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8514.7s	8514.7	 And this was a law passed by litigators with donor dollars in Sacramento that lets any lawyer bring a case on behalf of the state against a company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8526.7s	8526.7	 And so they're basically like local sheriffs just running around bringing claims.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8532.7s	8532.7	 And of course, they'll settle every time the the the supposed victims are getting about 10% on average on Paga claims.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8542.7s	8542.7	 And once your company's been shook down on three or four Paga claims by a lawyer who's only going to give 10 cents on the dollar to these people that used to work for you, you finally just throw up your hands and say, you know, I don't need to hire someone here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8556.7s	8556.7	 I'll hire someone somewhere else. Costs twice as much to hire someone here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8560.7s	8560.7	 And so I do worry that if any state or country wants to move forward in our new economy, they can't just be completely anti business, anti tech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8575.7s	8575.7	 I have a strong point of view on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8577.7s	8577.7	 It won't work. You're going to grind to a halt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8580.7s	8580.7	 Hey, Jay, Jason, can we go back to the Senate?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8583.7s	8583.7	 Is anybody prepared to I'm getting a read from my analysts who are live blogging to me that the Senate is almost certain to go Republican at this point, with Iowa, Maine and North Carolina going Republican.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8597.7s	8597.7	 That would do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8598.7s	8598.7	 And Michigan and Montana both in real danger for Democrats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8602.7s	8602.7	 But even if they lost both of those, you're going to have 5149 to Republicans in the Senate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8609.7s	8609.7	 Hey, Brad, why are markets trading down a bit right now from where they were?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8613.7s	8613.7	 I still have it at, you know, Nasdaq 280.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8619.7s	8619.7	 So I'm not I'm not prepared to call that down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8623.7s	8623.7	 I just think that's what the bounce and both and Bovada, I guess, which is the the body just came back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8632.7s	8632.7	 They stopped taking action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8633.7s	8633.7	 Now they've got Trump minus 150.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8636.7s	8636.7	 Is that how you say it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8637.7s	8637.7	 And Joe Biden plus 115.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8639.7s	8639.7	 So to if you put $100 on Joe Biden, you win 15.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8644.7s	8644.7	 Is that right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8646.7s	8646.7	 And if you want to 100, you win 115, 115, 115, 115 is very close, Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8656.7s	8656.7	 And Donald Trump, if you were to put $100 in, you make 150.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8661.7s	8661.7	 Is that right, Phil Hellmeyer?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8663.7s	8663.7	 You'd have to know if you 150 to win 100.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8666.7s	8666.7	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8668.7s	8668.7	 Got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8669.7s	8669.7	 OK, I think the more surprising thing at this point is it's almost, you know, I'm certainly going to live to write this, but it appears at this point that the market's going to be up tomorrow, almost either way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8684.7s	8684.7	 And if you look at what the market was saying last week, you know, just yet another surprise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8690.7s	8690.7	 The market is celebrating the fact that this is a close election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8694.7s	8694.7	 But, you know, if it's a if it's a contested transfer of power and we have, you know, there's there's certainly a lot of room for uncertainty, uncertainty to still be injected into this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8708.7s	8708.7	 But it likes the fact that we whether it's Biden or Trump who pulls out the presidency is certainly liking the fact that it's going to be a close election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8717.7s	8717.7	 Right now, just to give people an indication, Fox News has Joe Biden at 227 electoral votes and Trump at 204.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8726.7s	8726.7	 The New York Times is at 213 and 136 for Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8731.7s	8731.7	 The Senate on the New York Times is 44 Dems, 45 Republicans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8738.7s	8738.7	 And I don't know how we're supposed to who we're supposed to trust here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8744.7s	8744.7	 There's a Senate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8745.7s	8745.7	 The Senate on Fox News is 45 Democrat, 44 Republican.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8751.7s	8751.7	 So this is a dead heat, which I think could lean us towards the great reconciliation, which is if Trump comes out of office, Biden becomes the elder statesman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8762.7s	8762.7	 Biden reaches across the aisle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8764.7s	8764.7	 We have a massive balance of power in the Senate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8768.7s	8768.7	 Everybody's forced to work together in order to get anything done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8771.7s	8771.7	 Am I correct in my reading of this as a nonpolitical expert?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8775.7s	8775.7	 Well, what you're describing is the great gerontocracy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8778.7s	8778.7	 We'll have 78 year old Biden negotiating 79 year old McConnell and Schumer is what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8785.7s	8785.7	 74, 75.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8786.7s	8786.7	 Pelosi is over 80.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8788.7s	8788.7	 Steny Hoyer, her deputy, is over 80.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8790.7s	8790.7	 So who do we have in the death pool?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8792.7s	8792.7	 Because two or three of those are dying in the next four years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8795.7s	8795.7	 Oh, I don't mean to make it dark, but just looking at McConnell and his bruised hands and lips and everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8803.7s	8803.7	 Something's eating him alive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8804.7s	8804.7	 I'm not exactly sure what it is, but that's a bad, bad scene.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8809.7s	8809.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8810.7s	8810.7	 Is that on the betting markets, Phil?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8812.7s	8812.7	 That's not on the betting markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8814.7s	8814.7	 And by the way, the other direction you're talking about Trump, who's 74 negotiating, I mean, you know, it's it's everybody's we've got to get younger in our political leadership across the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8825.7s	8825.7	 It's it's ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8828.7s	8828.7	 Who who had a better chance of beating Trump?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8833.7s	8833.7	 Would Bernie Elizabeth Warren or Buttigieg would one of those three, if you had to pick one of those three and I think it's one of those rates or you could pick your other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8842.7s	8842.7	 Which one would have performed better?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8844.7s	8844.7	 Brad, you said with Brad Brad, I'll make a P for sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8848.7s	8848.7	 I'm with Brad on that one here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8850.7s	8850.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8851.7s	8851.7	 So, Bill, you believe Mayor Pete would have had a better performance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8855.7s	8855.7	 He would have been more inspiring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8857.7s	8857.7	 He would have been more energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8859.7s	8859.7	 I think that there is a lot of people that want what Brad talked about, which is someone who's who's rational and calm and and centered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8869.7s	8869.7	 And I also think that if you look at the history of of presidential campaigns, most Americans favor an outsider.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8876.7s	8876.7	 And I attribute that to personally to them feeling like Washington's on the hook and been bought.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8882.7s	8882.7	 And, you know, Biden would be an outlier for a lifetime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8887.7s	8887.7	 Senator, there was a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8888.7s	8888.7	 There was a lot of excitement around Obama.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8890.7s	8890.7	 There was a lot of excitement about Reagan, who came from Hollywood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8893.7s	8893.7	 There was a lot of excitement about Clinton.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8896.7s	8896.7	 So, you know, a lot of governors, a lot of a lot of first time senators is what you tend to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8902.7s	8902.7	 And so Pete fit that mold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8905.7s	8905.7	 Why some youth and some charisma would be nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8908.7s	8908.7	 And David, the two Davids and Michael, who do you think would have put up the best fight?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8915.7s	8915.7	 Because tonight, if Biden does win and it's feeling maybe like that's going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8922.7s	8922.7	 So it's clearly a jump ball here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8925.7s	8925.7	 It's coming down to the last 30 seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8928.7s	8928.7	 If Biden does lose, who would have been the candidate that would have beaten Trump if there was another one?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8937.7s	8937.7	 Who would have had the next best chance?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8938.7s	8938.7	 David's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8939.7s	8939.7	 Well, Biden's still looking pretty good right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8941.7s	8941.7	 So I don't know that there I don't know that there was somebody better, but I do agree that I always was most impressed with Buttigieg out of the candidates in the sense that I thought he was the most articulate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8954.7s	8954.7	 I thought he was the best debater.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8955.7s	8955.7	 I thought he was the best on TV and he knew how to reach for the center.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8958.7s	8958.7	 And he had the kind of Obama thing of having identity politics politics working for him, but without making a big deal out of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8967.7s	8967.7	 And and so, yeah, he was what you mean by that, Mr.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8972.7s	8972.7	 Well, he's he's gay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8974.7s	8974.7	 He'd be the first gay president, but he's not making that an explicit part of the reason to vote for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8980.7s	8980.7	 And but it would have been a first and his voters would know that, but he doesn't want to, you know, he doesn't want to run on the idea of identity politics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8987.7s	8987.7	 And so he's not leading with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8989.7s	8989.7	 He's not leading with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8990.7s	8990.7	 I think that's a smart way to play it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=8992.7s	8992.7	 It's, you know, Obama was obviously an incredibly important first, but he didn't lead with that as the reason why you should vote for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9000.7s	9000.7	 So to a certain extent, Hillary did lead with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9003.7s	9003.7	 Hillary was going to be the I'm with her, you know, and was the slogan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9008.7s	9008.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9009.7s	9009.7	 And I think a lot of people did want to make that first, but I think you have those votes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9014.7s	9014.7	 You need to make the case to everybody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9016.7s	9016.7	 So, yeah, I think he's a great political athlete and, you know, someone who's got probably a bright future in the Democrat Party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9025.7s	9025.7	 I'm seeing some people on Twitter say that Biden's now become the favorite, but I just checked Betfair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9030.7s	9030.7	 It's basically one point one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9032.7s	9032.7	 It's very close now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9033.7s	9033.7	 Kind of crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9035.7s	9035.7	 This is going to come down to Pennsylvania and Michigan, and it's going to take days to do those counts and we're probably going to end up in the courts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9043.7s	9043.7	 Check Betfair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9044.7s	9044.7	 Friedberg, who would have done a better job here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9048.7s	9048.7	 Look, I mean, the market already voted, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9051.7s	9051.7	 It voted for Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9052.7s	9052.7	 He is the leading candidate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9054.7s	9054.7	 I don't know if anyone else would have outperformed Biden at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9057.7s	9057.7	 I think, you know, the next in line was a very different ideology, and that's Bernie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9061.7s	9061.7	 And, you know, Bernie really is the contrast to, you know, the points that we were making earlier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9068.7s	9068.7	 You either think that the way forward is to have the government leave me alone or to wrap me up in a blanket and give me a hot cocoa and rub my feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9077.7s	9077.7	 And Bernie Sanders is the, you know, the guy in middle school who runs for class president and tells you the vending machines are all going to be free if you elect me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9086.7s	9086.7	 And that's a broadly, you know, like everyone votes for that guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9090.7s	9090.7	 Let me let me ask you a question, Brad, that I build off of David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9095.7s	9095.7	 I just think the Mayor Pete thing, by the way, let me just say I think Mayor Pete is a great, articulate, thoughtful guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9100.7s	9100.7	 And it's certainly appealing to those of us who want to have a thoughtful, well articulated response to the problems we're facing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9107.7s	9107.7	 But I think that there is a guttural kind of, you know, innate drive that folks want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9112.7s	9112.7	 They either want free shit or they want to be left alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9114.7s	9114.7	 And, you know, you're going to need to appeal to one of those two motives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9119.7s	9119.7	 Brad, how would you have voted had your choice been?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9123.7s	9123.7	 And I'm going to go around the horn on this so everybody gets a chance to think about it, except really Brad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9127.7s	9127.7	 Brad, if you had the choice, Elizabeth Warren slash Bernie, hardcore socialist, let's go with Bernie since I think he's even more on the socialist side or Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9140.7s	9140.7	 Could you have conceived of voting for Trump over Bernie or would you have voted actually voted for Bernie Sanders?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9149.7s	9149.7	 Take your time and you can think out loud when you answer that question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9152.7s	9152.7	 I mean, I have to say that, you know, I have a nine and twelve year old boy, boys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9159.7s	9159.7	 And the conversation we had is it's not just about what you stand for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9165.7s	9165.7	 It's about how you stand for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9167.7s	9167.7	 Character.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9168.7s	9168.7	 Character. And I just couldn't tolerate Trump's character, either in my own life, my own level of anxiety or or.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9179.7s	9179.7	 Standing for that, you know, and telling my boys that that's a OK way to lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9184.7s	9184.7	 And so for me, I was willing to vote against my own interests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9189.7s	9189.7	 And taking comfort in the fact that four years under any president is not enough to really change the arc of of the country, but to send a signal that, you know, how you lead matters in this country and a rejection of this form of leadership.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9207.7s	9207.7	 Yeah, but Brad, if you didn't think that Bernie Sanders policies would actually I mean, if you thought they would actually pass everything he wanted to do, you couldn't conceive them of voting for Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9217.7s	9217.7	 Yeah, I mean, you know, again, like I would just say that I would have bet that the system that we have would have been slow enough in moving that that Bernie would not have been, you know, that when weighing those two evils, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9232.7s	9232.7	 That, you know, again, for me, socialism versus Trump, are you're telling me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9236.7s	9236.7	 I can I can tolerate the mean spiritedness, perhaps myself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9241.7s	9241.7	 But, you know, like I'm trying to, you know, I think it is important that we we say that like this is not what we stand for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9248.7s	9248.7	 This is not a an honorable way to lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9251.7s	9251.7	 And and certainly when it comes to sitting around the dinner table every night and talking to them about the way I expect them to behave in their form of leadership, you know, that that mean spiritedness just didn't work for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9263.7s	9263.7	 Would anybody else like to answer that question?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9265.7s	9265.7	 Well, I'm not I'm not going to disagree with any of that, but I would just like to point out I'd like to ask a question, actually, which is if if this president was so bad that he had to be impeached, why wasn't that a campaign issue?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9278.7s	9278.7	 I don't remember being mentioned once by Biden that Trump was impeached.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9284.7s	9284.7	 You would think that impeaching the president would be something you'd want to make a major campaign issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9290.7s	9290.7	 So I just think this idea that Trump is the only one who's dishonest and unethical, you know, that whole Russian insane hoax that they put us through for years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9302.7s	9302.7	 They put this whole country through before the guy even took office.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9306.7s	9306.7	 They were trying to delegitimize his election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9308.7s	9308.7	 I mean, come on. You can't just look at Trump's behavior, which I agree is outrageous and not look at the other side and say they're doing the same thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9317.7s	9317.7	 And this is like a they're they're they're sort of like co equal partners in this chaos that's been created.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9324.7s	9324.7	 David, let's put their co founders in chaos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9327.7s	9327.7	 Let's be candid. All these politicians that we've had to live with in our lifetime are grifters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9331.7s	9331.7	 We know that and their kids are grifters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9333.7s	9333.7	 Putting that aside, do you think there is any chance that the Russians have not bought an inordinate amount of apartments from Donald Trump at extraordinary prices?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9344.7s	9344.7	 Are you just making that up or? I mean, I'm just going with my gut. Right. Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9351.7s	9351.7	 Yeah. QED case in point, because you feel it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9354.7s	9354.7	 You can now make an accusation that the president has received bribes from the Russians.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9359.7s	9359.7	 I mean, come on. Well, we know. And actually, I want to I want to bring up something election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9363.7s	9363.7	 We all know Putin interfere with the election and we all know he interfered on behalf of one candidate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9368.7s	9368.7	 OK, I honestly like unless you don't trust the CIA, unless you don't trust the FBI, unless you don't trust our agents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9375.7s	9375.7	 Really? I mean, you believe in the deep. You're still holding on to the Russians.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9378.7s	9378.7	 The reelection we've ever had, Jason. Jason, this is worse than the New York Post.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9384.7s	9384.7	 We had we had Bob. We had Bob Mueller with a team of like 18 like pit bull Democratic prosecutors and 50 special FBI FBI agents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9394.7s	9394.7	 Who investigated for two years and they couldn't find any collusion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9398.7s	9398.7	 I mean, come on. And you're still hanging on to this this insane fallacy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9404.7s	9404.7	 And you're wondering why the American people are turning against why they're willing to vote for Trump again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9410.7s	9410.7	 Come on. Can't you see the insanity of the other side?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9414.7s	9414.7	 Well, I mean, I did see Manafort go to jail and pay a twenty five, thirty million dollar fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9418.7s	9418.7	 And I did see that Trump's kids took the meeting with the Russians to try to set up a secret back channel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9425.7s	9425.7	 So while they might not have been smart enough or effective enough to actually collude, there certainly was a lot of graph going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9432.7s	9432.7	 This is this is this is on the level, if not worse than the whole Hunter Biden hard drive story, which I thought was a hundred by which I thought was a ridiculous story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9442.7s	9442.7	 An attempt to smear up Biden. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9445.7s	9445.7	 But I for you to lay this integrity issue on Trump alone, which I agree there's some truth there and not laid on his Democratic inquisitors in the Senate who put in the House who put us through this impeachment hoax for two years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9461.7s	9461.7	 Come on. We're starting to sound a little like AM radio. Let's get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9465.7s	9465.7	 We did go there. No sex is a free thinker. I like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9468.7s	9468.7	 He's a free thinker for sure. But this word is this entire campaign is on both sides of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9476.7s	9476.7	 I guess I'm trying to buy you initially say, well, Jason, can you say the word?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9481.7s	9481.7	 I'm with you. Can you say it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9484.7s	9484.7	 Can you say the word impeachment? Impeachment? I just said, OK, there we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9488.7s	9488.7	 I was wondering what happened to that word. You know, normally, normally when you win a president, if you normally when you impeach a president becomes a really big campaign issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9497.7s	9497.7	 Nick, can you please throw Georgia back on the map, please?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9500.7s	9500.7	 Are you guys seeing this that now they're tipping Georgia back to Biden?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9507.7s	9507.7	 Who is. This is insane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9513.7s	9513.7	 Where? Well, they're also saying that Arizona may have been prematurely called for Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9518.7s	9518.7	 So Arizona may be back in play for Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9524.7s	9524.7	 That was really weird that they called Arizona so early, wasn't it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9527.7s	9527.7	 Nick, only Fox, only Fox has done it, I think. Yeah, Nick, where do you have how do you have Georgia reporting right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9533.7s	9533.7	 How much is in right now? Yeah, you can't Georgia just for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9537.7s	9537.7	 We have 81 percent. Yeah, the Times had it flip on at nine 13 p.m.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9543.7s	9543.7	 I have a screenshot which shows Biden plus four and then North Carolina is now just Trump plus one point one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9550.7s	9550.7	 Michael, in Arizona, when they show the reporting, it's precincts reporting, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9555.7s	9555.7	 It doesn't show mail ins are by precinct or mail ins are at the state level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9560.7s	9560.7	 Well, a precinct will have both mail ins and election day votes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9567.7s	9567.7	 And when they and when they say 81 percent of precincts reporting, that doesn't mean that 81 percent of precincts are finished reporting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9576.7s	9576.7	 It's a very misleading number because what it means that 81 percent of precincts have reported what they have, but it doesn't mean they're finished counting necessarily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9588.7s	9588.7	 Right. So, you know, Atlanta is probably the precincts in Atlanta have probably reported some vote.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9593.7s	9593.7	 In fact, we we see that when we click on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9596.7s	9596.7	 But there's obviously a lot of outstanding vote in Georgia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9599.7s	9599.7	 There could be outstanding vote in some precincts in North Carolina as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9603.7s	9603.7	 And at this point, once you get into the 95 percent and above range, they do tend to be urban centers that are that obviously have a lot more vote to count.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9613.7s	9613.7	 It gets late at night. They go home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9617.7s	9617.7	 They finish in the morning or three days later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9619.7s	9619.7	 If you go zoom in on Arizona, please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9621.7s	9621.7	 Seventy six percent of voting reporting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9624.7s	9624.7	 I mean, how is this possible?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9626.7s	9626.7	 Fifty four percent, basically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9628.7s	9628.7	 I don't know, but in all those states, you're going to have the intensity you had around Hanging Chads and Dade County.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9634.7s	9634.7	 You're just going to have like massive tension and drama around counting each of these last.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9642.7s	9642.7	 Yeah, we're going to have five Floridas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9645.7s	9645.7	 You knew 2020 would do this on the way out the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9648.7s	9648.7	 Yeah. So Arizona, they counted all the absentee ballots for the mail in ballots first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9652.7s	9652.7	 But the in-person voting hasn't been counted yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9655.7s	9655.7	 So you can't call that state if they haven't counted all the in-person because Trump's going to do better with election day ballots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9662.7s	9662.7	 I agree. It's premature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9664.7s	9664.7	 Well, it depends on whether they're considering Phoenix as part of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9667.7s	9667.7	 Right. OK. Why is Nevada only reporting one percent?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9674.7s	9674.7	 In local news, there are now groups of people gathering at Oakland City Hall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9680.7s	9680.7	 So they go there when like what night aren't they riding in Oakland?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9688.7s	9688.7	 I mean, come on in Berkeley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9691.7s	9691.7	 They smashed a pizzeria window. They do it every other week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9694.7s	9694.7	 Hey, guys, I want to I want to discuss an idea I have that might be a little bit cheeky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9699.7s	9699.7	 But since Jake and I were getting into it before, I kind of want to I want to talk about a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9704.7s	9704.7	 OK, let's do it. Which is I've called the Trump derangement score, which is if you go to Twitter, the Trump derangement score,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9715.7s	9715.7	 which is if you go to Twitter and search Trump from your username, it'll show you how many tweets you've you've published that you've posted that mentioned the word Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9727.7s	9727.7	 And so I did this before the show to see which bestie had tweeted the most and see what the score was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9734.7s	9734.7	 And my sense is like if your your score is like zero to ten, you haven't really paid a lot of attention to Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9740.7s	9740.7	 It's probably like very healthy. And then if you're in like the 10 to 30 range, you're paying a little more attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9747.7s	9747.7	 This could be a normal interest. Here it comes. Here it comes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9753.7s	9753.7	 For myself, I say, hold on, if you're in like the 30 to 50 range, I think you pretty much are infected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9760.7s	9760.7	 There's two strains. There's kind of the magus strain and then there's the resistance strain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9764.7s	9764.7	 But clearly you've tested positive for Trump derangement syndrome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9770.7s	9770.7	 And then I would say there's kind of like an advanced level where you can't even count how many tweets there are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9776.7s	9776.7	 You've got to like scroll and like you keep scrolling and you can't even get to the bottom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9780.7s	9780.7	 And that's that's like a level of infection where you need to immediately quarantine yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9784.7s	9784.7	 And so anyway, I did this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9788.7s	9788.7	 And anyway, the winner actually was Freeburg. Freeburg only had he had a score of one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9794.7s	9794.7	 He literally only had one tweet mentioning Trump for the last four years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9799.7s	9799.7	 I only had eight. But in fairness, five of them were posted yesterday to advertise this this pod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9805.7s	9805.7	 So I. My one was during this podcast, by the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9811.7s	9811.7	 Yeah. I'm off at 20. I had to tell you about 20, about 20.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9816.7s	9816.7	 Yeah. And then, Jake, you were in scrolling territory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9820.7s	9820.7	 I couldn't even I couldn't even count. I gave up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9828.7s	9828.7	 I feel for you. I really feel for you that you're hurting over this election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9831.7s	9831.7	 I, you know, I don't like I'm not trying to make fun of you or see you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9836.7s	9836.7	 Guys, another just another quick update here that DeKalb County, Fulton County and Cobb County in Georgia are pro Democrat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9845.7s	9845.7	 They're huge. And there are 31 percent, 58 percent and 70 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9852.7s	9852.7	 And if you play these out, there's somewhere between four hundred and five hundred thousand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9861.7s	9861.7	 potential incremental votes for Biden, which would eke out Georgia for Biden potentially, according to just this last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9872.7s	9872.7	 week. Just looking at Fox News, I think that they're trolling the libs because they have Trump at 210 and they have Joe Biden at 237.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9886.7s	9886.7	 The The New York Times has let me just make sure I'm refreshing here and have the latest data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9893.7s	9893.7	 Georgia, 13 to 145. So Fox is aggressively calling electoral votes at a level that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9907.7s	9907.7	 The New York Times is far behind, like behind by 50, at least 100.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9915.7s	9915.7	 What is the explanation of this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9917.7s	9917.7	 Wow. This is I mean, this is nuts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9922.7s	9922.7	 MSNBC 205 electoral votes for Joe Biden, which NBC has been the most conservative overall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9931.7s	9931.7	 And what happens if it's tied? It can tie, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9934.7s	9934.7	 We still have that scenario on the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9936.7s	9936.7	 Two sixty nine, two sixty nine. Yeah, that's probably a way to to get there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9943.7s	9943.7	 Let's see. Well, interestingly, Biden did not get that one district in Omaha, Nebraska that he had targeted that Obama won his first time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9955.7s	9955.7	 That would give you one electoral vote in Nebraska, Nebraska and Maine, both.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9960.7s	9960.7	 You get you get two for winning the state and you get one for each of the congressional districts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9966.7s	9966.7	 So while while Biden was not going to play an overall in Nebraska, he had a shot at Omaha and that two seventy two sixty eight scenario we talked about earlier could have potentially been two sixty nine, two sixty nine if that Omaha district was in play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9980.7s	9980.7	 But the polling really missed Michael just to jump in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9984.7s	9984.7	 BG Gurley Gurley's got to hop off, boys. Say bye to girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9989.7s	9989.7	 Speaking of Bill Gurley, how about Texas?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9992.7s	9992.7	 I mean, I think I think Texas is definitely going to be Republican, right, Michael?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9996.7s	9996.7	 Yeah, that one's trending far away from Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=9999.7s	9999.7	 He looks like he's down about 500,000. How many points is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10002.7s	10002.7	 No one's called that yet, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10004.7s	10004.7	 It's bizarre that Florida and Texas are still listed as right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10008.7s	10008.7	 So that could explain what J.K.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10010.7s	10010.7	 is looking at between the disparity and what I don't blame Fox.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10015.7s	10015.7	 If Fox called Texas, I don't blame them, but I think Arizona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10018.7s	10018.7	 Yeah, that might that might explain your difference, J.K.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10022.7s	10022.7	 Texas and Florida.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10024.7s	10024.7	 Yeah, Fox. Yeah, that's 60, 67 votes right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10028.7s	10028.7	 Yeah, that explains it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10030.7s	10030.7	 So the New York Times has not called Florida or Texas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10033.7s	10033.7	 The New York Times had Florida at 98 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10036.7s	10036.7	 I think it's like ninety nine point nine or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10038.7s	10038.7	 If you add 38 for Texas, 29 for Florida, you're 67, 67
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10043.7s	10043.7	 onto the 145, which you had two hundred twelve and Joe Biden at 213,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10048.7s	10048.7	 which is one point difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10051.7s	10051.7	 Ralph Warnock and Kelly Loeffler in a runoff for the Senate seat in Georgia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10055.7s	10055.7	 That's just incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10056.7s	10056.7	 I mean, hey, guys, a comment and then a question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10059.7s	10059.7	 It looks like the Washington Post has a lot of people who are going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10063.7s	10063.7	 I mean, hey, guys, a comment and then a question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10066.7s	10066.7	 It looks like the Washington Post is projecting that California approved Prop 22.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10071.7s	10071.7	 Yeah. So there is a that's the first one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10075.7s	10075.7	 What does that do to Biden speaking right now, I think, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10078.7s	10078.7	 Do we have Biden is not speaking yet, but he's he's getting ready.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10081.7s	10081.7	 He's about to speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10082.7s	10082.7	 The implied volatility on Uber stock at the close today was 14 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10087.7s	10087.7	 But by the way, every ballot initiative in San Francisco, the city level ballot initiatives passed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10092.7s	10092.7	 One of them, the prop H was good. All the rest were a disaster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10095.7s	10095.7	 So San Francisco, so the state level ballot initiatives were pretty good news for California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10100.7s	10100.7	 But San Francisco. OK, not much. Not so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10103.7s	10103.7	 So, you know, in terms of what we were talking about earlier about creating a more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10107.7s	10107.7	 business friendly environment, unfortunately, what happened in San Francisco?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10111.7s	10111.7	 I think California as a whole is positive with Prop 22, Prop 15 failing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10117.7s	10117.7	 But every single crazy ballot initiative in San Francisco passed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10121.7s	10121.7	 So it's just getting crazier and I don't know if you did this in your household, but with my 10 year old, Brad, I went through my wife and I, Jade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10128.7s	10128.7	 We went through each of the ballot initiatives as many as we could.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10133.7s	10133.7	 We listened to little encapsulations of what they were.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10137.7s	10137.7	 And we talked about the stem cell one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10139.7s	10139.7	 And I just thought, why is California, which is losing all of these businesses,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10147.7s	10147.7	 adding to the tax burden stem cell research?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10152.7s	10152.7	 And why isn't that being done by the private sector?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10155.7s	10155.7	 If there is a huge prize to be had with stem cell, why would we have California send billions of dollars on this when we're losing all the this government?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10164.7s	10164.7	 I'm wondering, you know, how people thought about something like that, like the stem cell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10170.7s	10170.7	 Did you vote for that, David, to continue to have California flip the bill for?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10176.7s	10176.7	 By the way, just before you answered, David, I took the pages of the ballot initiative and I use them to keep my white truffles from developing humidity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10184.7s	10184.7	 I mean, basically, there is a matter, Jason, is that when when I don't understand a ballot initiative, I just vote against it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10191.7s	10191.7	 And I didn't really understand that the stem cell ballot initiative or why the even why the if that was a spending priority, why couldn't just be handled by the state legislature?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10202.7s	10202.7	 I didn't understand why that needed to be a ballot initiative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10205.7s	10205.7	 So, you know, I feel like ballot initiative, like I'll support them when the state legislature does something wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10212.7s	10212.7	 Like it was a perfect example where Lorraine or whatever the had this tremendous amount of power passed this crazy AB five and the people had to overrule that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10222.7s	10222.7	 So I feel like that's where like these ballot initiatives make sense is when you want to overrule the legislature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10227.7s	10227.7	 But, you know, it's kind of crazy for to be passing these laws directly when, you know, we don't know that much about them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10234.7s	10234.7	 Concur. I mean, the founders had this vision of representative democracy, not direct democracy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10242.7s	10242.7	 And that's generally a good idea. So, Jason, I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10246.7s	10246.7	 You have to kind of like what director the results that direct democracy has produced tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10250.7s	10250.7	 The initiatives may be saving us from ourselves since we don't have in this state, unfortunately, a viable Republican Party to represent us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10258.7s	10258.7	 This the initiatives may be our last line of defense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10261.7s	10261.7	 Well, I think I think you're right in terms of overruling things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10264.7s	10264.7	 But like in San Francisco, you know, every single ballot initiative path, I think most of them are there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10270.7s	10270.7	 There's no saving San Francisco. We all knew that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10273.7s	10273.7	 Well, I don't like hearing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10276.7s	10276.7	 Come to L.A., baby. We got a few more years at least.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10281.7s	10281.7	 What is the consensus view seems to be the markets are still up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10285.7s	10285.7	 Nasdaq futures up to 80 still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10288.7s	10288.7	 What what causes us to wake up tomorrow or the next day and have the futures down three, four or five hundred?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10299.7s	10299.7	 There's there's one thing and so far it hasn't happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10302.7s	10302.7	 And if we avoid it, we're going to fade a really big out here, which is Trump declares victory right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10314.7s	10314.7	 I think that is the disaster scenario because I think Biden's going to get up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10319.7s	10319.7	 He's not going to say much of anything. He'll be very kind of down the middle, you know, kind of let's take a wait and see approach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10325.7s	10325.7	 We're waiting until tomorrow. There's a lot to go grind it out, blah, blah, blah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10329.7s	10329.7	 But if Trump comes out and says we won, we're done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10332.7s	10332.7	 Let's move on. It's going to be a panic because look, I mean, he's you can't certify Georgia, apparently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10340.7s	10340.7	 Right. So, you know, there's a there's a path where there's seven or eight states that have to go through a meticulous recount.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10349.7s	10349.7	 I think this thing is back to a coin flip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10352.7s	10352.7	 I mean, Trump now has to win Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania in order to win the presidency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10360.7s	10360.7	 If Biden wins any one of those three states, he wins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10363.7s	10363.7	 He has to be a three for three in Georgia, Pennsylvania and Michigan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10369.7s	10369.7	 Well, we're saying that may that may become ungod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10375.7s	10375.7	 So if he loses Georgia, he loses if he loses Pennsylvania, he loses his Michigan loses, assuming he's already lost Wisconsin and in Arizona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10388.7s	10388.7	 So, hey, guys, Biden's coming out. But my analysts just run this analysis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10393.7s	10393.7	 If Biden wins Ann Arbor and Detroit by the same percentage as 2016, that's four hundred and twenty thousand Biden incremental votes versus the three hundred thousand current Trump lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10406.7s	10406.7	 Just apply the Clinton math and he wins Michigan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10410.7s	10410.7	 We feel good about where we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10414.7s	10414.7	 We really do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10417.7s	10417.7	 I'm here to tell you tonight, we believe we're on track to win this election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10427.7s	10427.7	 We knew because of the unprecedented early vote in the mail in vote, it's going to take a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10434.7s	10434.7	 We're going to have to be patient until we the hard work of tallying the votes is finished.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10440.7s	10440.7	 And it ain't over till every vote is counted. Every ballot is counted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10449.7s	10449.7	 But we're feeling good. We're feeling good about where we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10454.7s	10454.7	 We believe one of the Nets has suggested we've already won Arizona, but we're confident about Arizona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10461.7s	10461.7	 That's a turnaround. We also just called it for Minnesota.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10466.7s	10466.7	 And we're still in the game in Georgia, although that's not what we expected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10473.7s	10473.7	 And we're feeling real good about Wisconsin and Michigan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10479.7s	10479.7	 And by the way, it's going to take time to count the votes. We're going to win Pennsylvania.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10490.7s	10490.7	 We talked to the folks in Philly, Allegheny County, Scranton, and they're really encouraged by the turnout and what they see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10497.7s	10497.7	 Look, you know, we could know the results as early as tomorrow morning, but it may take a little longer, as I've said all along.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10505.7s	10505.7	 It's not my place or Donald Trump's place to declare who's won this election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10510.7s	10510.7	 That's the decision of the American people. But I'm optimistic about this outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10516.7s	10516.7	 I want to thank every one of you who came out and voted in this election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10521.7s	10521.7	 And by the way, Chris Coons and the Democrats, congratulations here in Delaware.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10527.7s	10527.7	 Hey, John, the Gov, yeah, the whole team, man, you've done a great job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10535.7s	10535.7	 I'm grateful to the poll workers, to our volunteers, our canvassers, everyone who participated in this democratic process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10543.7s	10543.7	 And I'm grateful to all my supporters here in Delaware and all across the nation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10548.7s	10548.7	 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And folks, you heard me say it before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10554.7s	10554.7	 Every time I walk out of my grandpa's house up in Scranton, he'd yell, Joey, keep the faith.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10559.7s	10559.7	 And my grandma, when she was live, yelled, no, Joey, spread it. Keep the faith, guys. We're going to win this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10566.7s	10566.7	 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10569.7s	10569.7	 Well, guys, before before before we just I just want to give a big shout out and thank you to Brad Gerstner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10575.7s	10575.7	 Thanks for an incredible investor and person and thinker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10579.7s	10579.7	 Thank you, BG, for being on the call. Thanks for having me. I really appreciate it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10584.7s	10584.7	 And thanks to Bill Gurley, who stepped in and Phil Helmuth. This has been a great first time effort.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10592.7s	10592.7	 We had, I think, about four thousand of you at the peak here and certainly five or six thousand over the night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10599.7s	10599.7	 This was an experiment, I think a successful one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10603.7s	10603.7	 And of course, I'm speaking about this country, America. What a successful experiment it has been to Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10610.7s	10610.7	 Jason, you can unclench your your nether regions because I think we're going to be OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10617.7s	10617.7	 I think we're going to be OK. Yeah, it's very tight. Anyway, see you guys. Good night. Thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10622.7s	10622.7	 Thank you. I'm changing my prediction to scenario three.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10625.7s	10625.7	 Biden president, let's do that as we wrap besties, besties, besties.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10630.7s	10630.7	 I'm still sticking with Biden. I'm still sticking with Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10634.7s	10634.7	 OK, Trump, Trump just tweeted that I will be making a statement tonight, a big win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10638.7s	10638.7	 So we were either in scenarios. Well, I mean, it's two, three and two, three and four are all still on the floor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10645.7s	10645.7	 I don't know if the viewers remember scenario one was a Biden landslide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10648.7s	10648.7	 That's clearly not happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10650.7s	10650.7	 The second scenario was basically what was Trump pulling a big upset that's still on the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10659.7s	10659.7	 I'd say probably 49 percent chance for right now, 40, 45 percent chance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10665.7s	10665.7	 Then you've kind of got the scenario three was the soft landing where Biden wins the presidency,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10670.7s	10670.7	 but the Republicans take the Senate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10673.7s	10673.7	 And I think it's probably like the 51 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10676.7s	10676.7	 And then scenario four was the shit show. That was a totally inconclusive outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10680.7s	10680.7	 Here we are. Here we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10682.7s	10682.7	 So, I mean, the reality is, I think this thing, I mean, I think it's probably at the end of the day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10687.7s	10687.7	 51, 49 in favor of Biden right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10690.7s	10690.7	 But we probably have at least three more days and maybe a bunch of court cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10694.7s	10694.7	 Yeah, this could this could be really bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10696.7s	10696.7	 I mean, we may not know who the winner is till December, and this may require another Supreme Court case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10702.7s	10702.7	 I think we'll know within a week who won.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10705.7s	10705.7	 But it's going to be it's going to be a white knuckle kind of week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10709.7s	10709.7	 We did you know, I think we're going to know tomorrow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10712.7s	10712.7	 I think we're in on tomorrow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10714.7s	10714.7	 I guess, you know, I guess based on the electoral map, I'd say it's 51, 49 in favor of Biden at this moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10722.7s	10722.7	 OK, so Sax wants Biden to win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10726.7s	10726.7	 Friedberg, where are you at the end of this shit show?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10730.7s	10730.7	 I was doing this 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10732.7s	10732.7	 I was looking at which island in Hawaii I want to go to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10737.7s	10737.7	 I'm looking at Austin. And then just to look at our final.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10743.7s	10743.7	 The dogs are getting a little better for Trump. I wonder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10746.7s	10746.7	 Who the hell knows?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10748.7s	10748.7	 This has been an incredible evening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10750.7s	10750.7	 I feel better about the market reaction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10752.7s	10752.7	 I feel like, you know, those of us who operate businesses and try and build businesses and, you know, have employees and all this stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10758.7s	10758.7	 I mean, I'm disappointed in San Francisco.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10760.7s	10760.7	 It's a fucking shit show of the city.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10762.7s	10762.7	 But I feel good about the fact that markets are taking this well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10765.7s	10765.7	 And it means businesses will continue to operate and find funding and shout out Billy in Hawaii.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10772.7s	10772.7	 Newsy, Newsy, what's your pick?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10774.7s	10774.7	 And then J.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10775.7s	10775.7	 Cal, and then we're going to bounce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10777.7s	10777.7	 I have to go with the math.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10778.7s	10778.7	 I think Trump dollar 60 is pretty significant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10781.7s	10781.7	 So I have to pick that direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10783.7s	10783.7	 And I'm going by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7MrXnMPpA&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=132&t=10785.7s	10785.7	 All right, everybody. This has been a special edition of the best.
