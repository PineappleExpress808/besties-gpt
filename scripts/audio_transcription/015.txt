https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=0.0s	0.0	 You gotta rise up before you begin, you gotta dive in before you can swim.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=6.0s	6.0	 You gotta give it all to win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=11.0s	11.0	 We're going all in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=13.0s	13.0	 Hey everybody, welcome back. Besties are back for the All In Podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=18.0s	18.0	 The Queen of Quinoa, Freeberg is here, The Dictator, Chamath, and of course Rain Man, David Sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=26.0s	26.0	 And it's been a big week here in Silicon Valley with Airbnb and Wish both going public for over $100 billion combined.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=33.0s	33.0	 Anybody get their beak wet on that one?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=36.0s	36.0	 Oh, hey guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=38.0s	38.0	 Oh, how are you David?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=44.0s	44.0	 I might have gotten my beak wet on a couple of those.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=48.0s	48.0	 Oh, a little beak wet, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=51.0s	51.0	 Well, you know what? In celebration of your recent victory with Airbnb and Wish, I will, oh no, I can't zoom in on my merch, but I've got my unofficial wet your beak mug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=66.0s	66.0	 So for those of you wondering, we have to get a little bit of housekeeping out of the way at first here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=73.0s	73.0	 The merch has gone crazy. Have you guys been watching merch on Twitter?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=78.0s	78.0	 Of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=80.0s	80.0	 Anybody got a favorite merch or thoughts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=83.0s	83.0	 I got some of those mugs. I think they arrived today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=86.0s	86.0	 They look great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=87.0s	87.0	 It's amazing. And you know, the best decision we made was not to let you sell t-shirts, Jason, because you would have milked this for every nickel you could.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=99.0s	99.0	 And instead, we open sourced it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=105.0s	105.0	 I mean, they're literally...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=106.0s	106.0	 I know that hurt you. I know that hurt you a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=109.0s	109.0	 I mean, the problem I'm having here, no advertising. I'm picking up all the production costs here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=114.0s	114.0	 I'm sending you guys equipment. You maniacs lose the equipment every time you go from one of your estates to another estate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=121.0s	121.0	 I'm sending equipment to four different places. Anyway, we've got a special, very special episode for you today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=129.0s	129.0	 We are doing... drum roll, please. We're going to add some sound effects to this afterwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=135.0s	135.0	 We're going to do the bestie awards today. So we're going to go through the biggest winners in politics and business and cultures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=140.0s	140.0	 And of course, the losers, the flashes in the pan, the best business moves, the stupidest business moves. We've got a lot to get through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=147.0s	147.0	 But just in terms of housekeeping, again, the all-in syndicate is up and running. I think there's 4,000 people have applied in 10 days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=155.0s	155.0	 Let's just talk about the market cap of Airbnb.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=158.0s	158.0	 Or Wish for that matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=161.0s	161.0	 What round did you invest in Airbnb?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=163.0s	163.0	 Seriously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=165.0s	165.0	 Was that the Founders Fund round?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=167.0s	167.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=168.0s	168.0	 Congrats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=169.0s	169.0	 Thanks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=170.0s	170.0	 Oh, that's so yummy. But to be honest, that was already over a billion dollar valuation, correct?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=175.0s	175.0	 Yeah, it was. It was. I mean, it's still like...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=178.0s	178.0	 It's still an 80 or 100X, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=179.0s	179.0	 It's like a 40X, right? 40X?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=180.0s	180.0	 It's like a 40X or something like that. So thank you, Brian Chesky. Thank you, Peter Thiel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=186.0s	186.0	 Peter led that round and Brian was looking to include founders in the round in addition to it being led by Founders Fund.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=194.0s	194.0	 And so Peter introduced me and that's how it happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=197.0s	197.0	 Wow. Fantastic. I did not get my big wet on that, but I did mention Airbnb on my podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=205.0s	205.0	 And I've been trying to get Brian on the podcast for, I don't know, a decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=209.0s	209.0	 And I said, I know you guys want to have him on the pod. I've asked him like literally every year for 10 years, but I don't think he likes me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=215.0s	215.0	 And then he emailed me and said, I listen to the podcast. I like you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=218.0s	218.0	 I was like, oh, okay, great. Will you come on? He's like, I'll come on. So he's going to come on this year, I think, which would be great for this week in startups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=224.0s	224.0	 Well, I think Brian and the whole team really did a masterful job of navigating through the whole COVID crisis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=231.0s	231.0	 I mean, everybody forgets how negative the publicity was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=236.0s	236.0	 People were talking about Airbnb as COVID roadkill back in April.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=242.0s	242.0	 I tweeted a CNBC headline from back in April wondering whether Airbnb was even going to survive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=251.0s	251.0	 And they navigated the crisis. They did have to cut headcount, but they made the company much more profitable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=258.0s	258.0	 But they also did great things for both the renters and the host.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=263.0s	263.0	 At the company's expense, they refunded something like $250 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=267.0s	267.0	 to the users who had canceled reservations, but they gave the money to the host to keep them afloat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=276.0s	276.0	 So they really did a great job navigating this whole crisis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=280.0s	280.0	 It's a pretty great company. He obviously cares deeply.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=283.0s	283.0	 It was very hard, I think, for him to cut all that staff at that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=288.0s	288.0	 It was kind of a tough decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=291.0s	291.0	 But they were very generous in how they did it. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=293.0s	293.0	 So congratulations on getting the Beak Wet Saks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=296.0s	296.0	 And Chamath, I got a bunch of inbound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=299.0s	299.0	 You had filed to sell some shares of Virgin Galactic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=302.0s	302.0	 I saw you tweeted about it and you wanted to be transparent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=304.0s	304.0	 People asked for you to address it upfront on the show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=307.0s	307.0	 So go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=308.0s	308.0	 Yeah, I have a lot of projects that I intend to fund in 2021.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=314.0s	314.0	 I'm probably going to put another, I don't know, I think the forecast was almost $2 billion to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=320.0s	320.0	 And I needed to manage my liquidity for this year and make sure that, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=328.0s	328.0	 I could continue to make all those investments and fund my,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=335.0s	335.0	 fund all of the other things that I need to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=337.0s	337.0	 And that's why I did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=339.0s	339.0	 And you're still a significant shareholder, I assume, and you believe in the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=344.0s	344.0	 Yeah, I mean, I remain completely committed to that business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=348.0s	348.0	 You know, it would have been better if I could have sold something else,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=352.0s	352.0	 but it's not quite possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=353.0s	353.0	 And when we're entering, when you leave the tax year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=356.0s	356.0	 you just have to make these decisions to lock in some gains against other losses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=361.0s	361.0	 And I would have loved to have not had to do it, but I needed to manage my liquidity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=365.0s	365.0	 And so I sold, you know, it's a small portion of what I own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=368.0s	368.0	 So yeah, that was sort of my point. This is a small portion of what you own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=372.0s	372.0	 And I mean, this is something that, you know, in poker and in business,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=377.0s	377.0	 you got to manage your chip stack and you got to manage your bankroll.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=380.0s	380.0	 So today we're going to do the besties.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=382.0s	382.0	 This is our first attempt at talking about our, it's our award show for 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=388.0s	388.0	 Let's leave it at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=389.0s	389.0	 Let's start out with the biggest winner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=392.0s	392.0	 Hold on, hold on a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=394.0s	394.0	 How much weight did you lose?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=395.0s	395.0	 Because it's either that you're still fat and you have a way where it's either you're still fat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=399.0s	399.0	 You have an incredible camera or you've actually lost weight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=403.0s	403.0	 And this reminds me, by the way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=405.0s	405.0	 I would like to tell a story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=407.0s	407.0	 No, no, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=408.0s	408.0	 Four years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=410.0s	410.0	 Oh my God. Here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=412.0s	412.0	 Jason and I make a weight bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=415.0s	415.0	 Okay. Just don't say the dollar amount.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=417.0s	417.0	 It was like, you know, it was like, I think it was like $10,000 a pound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=422.0s	422.0	 Whatever it was. Anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=423.0s	423.0	 And Jason, Jason, he would get 10th. He was about to do, and this is incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=427.0s	427.0	 Jason comes to us five years ago and says, guys, you won't believe it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=431.0s	431.0	 I'm doing a show on NBC, a reality TV show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=436.0s	436.0	 That's true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=437.0s	437.0	 And with.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=463.0s	463.0	 So I said, here's motivation.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=475.0s	475.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=477.0s	477.0	 It was like six months later and we're hosting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=481.0s	481.0	 I'm hosting a poker game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=483.0s	483.0	 And I realized, oh my God, this is the last.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=486.0s	486.0	 This is the last day of the bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=488.0s	488.0	 The day before.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=499.0s	499.0	 So I say, Jason, you got to be under one 90, one 92.5 or one 993 pounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=506.0s	506.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=507.0s	507.0	 He literally goes ash and white.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=510.0s	510.0	 And he says more white than I am now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=512.0s	512.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=513.0s	513.0	 I was maintaining my weight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=516.0s	516.0	 He says, he says, okay, okay, that's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=518.0s	518.0	 He had been eating pizza.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=519.0s	519.0	 You said that to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=522.0s	522.0	 He ate a brick of Brie.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=527.0s	527.0	 And then he says, he says, Freeberg, you won't believe this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=531.0s	531.0	 He goes, guys, I just need five minutes before the weigh in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=534.0s	534.0	 And then he goes to our guest bedroom and cries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=538.0s	538.0	 That's not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=539.0s	539.0	 That's not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=540.0s	540.0	 13 in this story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=543.0s	543.0	 Fabricating now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=544.0s	544.0	 He tried.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=545.0s	545.0	 He tried to get out five pounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=547.0s	547.0	 I took a leak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=548.0s	548.0	 Who could do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=549.0s	549.0	 After eating all that pizza and cheese and nachos and everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=554.0s	554.0	 Anyways, he loses the weight bet and he says, John, this is completely unfair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=559.0s	559.0	 I'm not going to pay you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=560.0s	560.0	 He was like 196 pounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=562.0s	562.0	 I'm not paying you this money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=564.0s	564.0	 One over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=567.0s	567.0	 And he said, this bet is not over until midnight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=571.0s	571.0	 The fall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=572.0s	572.0	 Obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=573.0s	573.0	 Yes, obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=574.0s	574.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=575.0s	575.0	 20 bars in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=576.0s	576.0	 Fair enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=577.0s	577.0	 So I said, all right, fine, Jake, I'll find he goes home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=578.0s	578.0	 He literally takes every diuretic known to man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=583.0s	583.0	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=584.0s	584.0	 And then he loses it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=586.0s	586.0	 He doesn't eat the whole day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=587.0s	587.0	 Two pairs of sweatpants and sweated it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=591.0s	591.0	 I checked in with this guy 10 times this day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=594.0s	594.0	 He walked like 12 miles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=596.0s	596.0	 He took four shits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=598.0s	598.0	 You know, I just went out steam room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=601.0s	601.0	 He lost bath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=602.0s	602.0	 Saxon did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=603.0s	603.0	 He did a colonoscopy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=605.0s	605.0	 He did a colonoscopy to his credit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=608.0s	608.0	 He lost five pounds by midnight and he was driving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=611.0s	611.0	 But then I said, Ben, I said, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=614.0s	614.0	 Because there were two different weigh-ins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=616.0s	616.0	 We were going to go play in a poker tournament.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=619.0s	619.0	 So we went and played in the poker tournament.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=620.0s	620.0	 I said, Jamal, buy me into the poker tournament.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=622.0s	622.0	 Well, whatever we win, we'll chop it up if it happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=625.0s	625.0	 So we just made it into a friendly thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=627.0s	627.0	 And obviously the great now that story is out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=630.0s	630.0	 And now I'm going to everybody's going to be on Twitter with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=634.0s	634.0	 code 30 shirt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=636.0s	636.0	 And I hope somebody in the all in army does the t-shirt that just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=639.0s	639.0	 says one 92.5 and we'll all know what it means, which is the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=643.0s	643.0	 that the one 90 it was one 93, one 93, which is crazy that I'm one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=648.0s	648.0	 It was one 93.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=649.0s	649.0	 Anyway, here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=650.0s	650.0	 Getting into the categories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=652.0s	652.0	 Our first category is the biggest winner in politics, biggest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=657.0s	657.0	 winner in politics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=658.0s	658.0	 I'm going to ask you gentlemen to raise your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=660.0s	660.0	 If you have a strong feeling on this, I'll call on one of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=663.0s	663.0	 Who's got a big winner in politics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=666.0s	666.0	 Go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=667.0s	667.0	 Shamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=668.0s	668.0	 Joe Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=669.0s	669.0	 Joe Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=670.0s	670.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=671.0s	671.0	 Going out in the limb there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=672.0s	672.0	 I mean, let's be honest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=674.0s	674.0	 There's nobody bigger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=675.0s	675.0	 And actually, if you want it to abstract it, what I would say is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=678.0s	678.0	 centrism was the big winner and it kind of feeds the losers, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=682.0s	682.0	 sort of the extreme left and the extreme right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=684.0s	684.0	 But I would say that centrism and Joe Biden were the huge, huge, huge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=688.0s	688.0	 winners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=689.0s	689.0	 Well, I'll give a I'll give a an orthodox pick, which is Xi Jinping,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=694.0s	694.0	 the chairman of the Chinese Communist Party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=697.0s	697.0	 You would have thought he would have had a bad year starting off with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=701.0s	701.0	 COVID starting in his country at the beginning of the year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=705.0s	705.0	 But he was a real bad guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=707.0s	707.0	 He was able that they, you know, that a global plague came from China, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=712.0s	712.0	 they were able to kind of they were able to use a very gullible WHO to launder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=718.0s	718.0	 responsibility for the catastrophe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=721.0s	721.0	 And they took advantage of the crisis to build more client states in Asia and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=725.0s	725.0	 Africa with promises of vaccines and money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=728.0s	728.0	 And finally, his biggest global nemesis, Trump and then Pompeo lost in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=734.0s	734.0	 election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=735.0s	735.0	 So you have to say he came out on top at the end of this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=739.0s	739.0	 Free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=740.0s	740.0	 I I I put I have the exact same answer as sex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=743.0s	743.0	 I put the Chinese Communist Party as a whole, actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=746.0s	746.0	 And I feel like on the world stage, they're they're strengthened in in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=751.0s	751.0	 post-COVID world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=752.0s	752.0	 So I had Kamala.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=755.0s	755.0	 Yeah, because she went from the famous quote in the debates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=759.0s	759.0	 There was a little girl in California who was bus to school.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=762.0s	762.0	 That little girl was me where she took on Joe Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=765.0s	765.0	 And then she winds up getting the VP slot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=768.0s	768.0	 And I think she winds up actually becoming president and will be the first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=774.0s	774.0	 female president of the year of the of the history of the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=778.0s	778.0	 And that could happen in the first term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=780.0s	780.0	 Or if Joe Biden doesn't run for a second term and they do a halfway decent job,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=784.0s	784.0	 Kamala plus Pete Buttigieg is a pretty great ticket as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=788.0s	788.0	 Who's the biggest loser?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=790.0s	790.0	 Who's your biggest loser?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=791.0s	791.0	 Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=794.0s	794.0	 In politics, Donald J.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=795.0s	795.0	 Trump and the obvious answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=798.0s	798.0	 Extreme left, the extreme left and the extreme right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=801.0s	801.0	 Got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=802.0s	802.0	 I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=804.0s	804.0	 But I'd also add Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, her impeachment of Trump at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=810.0s	810.0	 the beginning of the year went absolutely nowhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=812.0s	812.0	 It wasn't even an issue in the election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=814.0s	814.0	 And her majority in the House has almost completely disappeared.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=818.0s	818.0	 She lost a dozen seats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=820.0s	820.0	 I think the the I think she's down to about four or five seats as a razor thin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=825.0s	825.0	 majority in the House.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=826.0s	826.0	 And she's set to lose more in the midterm elections.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=829.0s	829.0	 I predict that she is set to not be speaker anymore in two years and headed for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=835.0s	835.0	 retirement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=837.0s	837.0	 OK, Freeberg, you got one biggest loser.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=839.0s	839.0	 I have I have the institution of American democracy is the biggest loser of 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=845.0s	845.0	 I feel like we're coming out of this year with like no belief that our election was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=850.0s	850.0	 valid for a vast majority for a sizable minority of this country that that the whole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=857.0s	857.0	 some Democrats believe that the election was fraudulent now, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=861.0s	861.0	 I mean, if you say something enough times, everyone believes it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=864.0s	864.0	 So, you know, here we are coming out of this year where with a crippling lack of faith
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=871.0s	871.0	 in our electoral system, and it's scary that American democracy is being fundamentally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=877.0s	877.0	 questioned by its own constituents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=879.0s	879.0	 So so I think that's the biggest loser.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=881.0s	881.0	 I had I had two choices here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=884.0s	884.0	 One of them was already said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=885.0s	885.0	 I said the hysterical left as my runner up, Bernie and Warren just dismissed by Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=891.0s	891.0	 and Kamala.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=892.0s	892.0	 They are not even part of the discussion anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=895.0s	895.0	 And they didn't even get cabinet positions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=897.0s	897.0	 So the hysterical left and the Socialist Communist Party is out of the Democratic Party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=902.0s	902.0	 Thank the Lord.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=903.0s	903.0	 But my biggest loser, I have to say that this is the worst run of any politician I've ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=908.0s	908.0	 seen in a year, which is Rudy Giuliani under investigation for less parnas and eager from

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=921.0s	921.0	 shirt tuck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=922.0s	922.0	 I don't know if we have feelings on if that was a tuck or if he was trying to wake up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=926.0s	926.0	 the genie and then he bleeds hair dye.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=929.0s	929.0	 Then he starts bleeding hair dye.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=932.0s	932.0	 Wake up the genie.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=937.0s	937.0	 Andy's in the hospital with covid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=940.0s	940.0	 I mean, just think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=943.0s	943.0	 If you think you had a shitty year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=946.0s	946.0	 I think there's going to be the fans of the show are now registering domain names of things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=953.0s	953.0	 we say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=954.0s	954.0	 The upside for him is that Donald Trump's campaign is paying him $20,000 a day in legal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=959.0s	959.0	 fees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=960.0s	960.0	 I think it was 200.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=961.0s	961.0	 No, it's 20 grand a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=963.0s	963.0	 It was only 20.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=964.0s	964.0	 That's his going rate for making a fool of himself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=967.0s	967.0	 I have a feeling that rate was adjusted when Rudy couldn't get the case to the Supreme
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=974.0s	974.0	 Court.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=975.0s	975.0	 Well, we all know that Trump pays his bills on time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=977.0s	977.0	 So it shouldn't be a problem, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=980.0s	980.0	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=981.0s	981.0	 Now we're going to have some more fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=984.0s	984.0	 Biggest winner in business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=986.0s	986.0	 Biggest winner in business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=987.0s	987.0	 Freeberg, you want to lead us off?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=988.0s	988.0	 You haven't let us off yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=989.0s	989.0	 I'll take this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=990.0s	990.0	 I think that the biggest winner in business this year is a company that started a few
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=994.0s	994.0	 years ago called Moderna.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=996.0s	996.0	 This company had a IPO in December of 18 at seven and a half billion dollar market cap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1001.0s	1001.0	 It traded between four and five billion throughout 2019.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1004.0s	1004.0	 And all of a sudden, covid hits and this becomes a vaccine candidate driver for Moderna.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1010.0s	1010.0	 And the stock shoots up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1011.0s	1011.0	 It's worth 60 billion today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1013.0s	1013.0	 This company has not had a product that's gone to market prior to covid and they struggled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1017.0s	1017.0	 getting this business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1019.0s	1019.0	 I wouldn't say struggle, but they never really had an application for their MRNA technology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1024.0s	1024.0	 They looked at it for years, iterating and pivoting this business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1028.0s	1028.0	 And covid, like a lot of other businesses, really gave them an unbelievable kick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1033.0s	1033.0	 And as of tonight, a shot on the arm, a shot in the arm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1036.0s	1036.0	 And tonight they got approval from the FDA and they're going to be shipping, starting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1039.0s	1039.0	 to on Monday, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1040.0s	1040.0	 Sax, who you got for the biggest winner in business?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1043.0s	1043.0	 We're moving at a good pace here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1045.0s	1045.0	 Elon Musk, our friend, rose to become the second richest man in the world ahead of Bill Gates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1052.0s	1052.0	 And, you know, right on the heels of Jeff Bezos, his company, Tesla, had something like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1058.0s	1058.0	 a eight or 10 X gains over a five hundred billion dollar company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1062.0s	1062.0	 Of course, the products are awesome.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1077.0s	1077.0	 And it is just magic that you can unbox this little satellite dish, plug it in and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1082.0s	1082.0	 have broadband Internet from space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1084.0s	1084.0	 So I think, you know, Elon seems to be on track to be not only the world's richest man,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1090.0s	1090.0	 but the world's first trillionaire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1092.0s	1092.0	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1093.0s	1093.0	 Big, big, big ups there to E.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1097.0s	1097.0	 Chamath, what do you got for the biggest winner in business of 2020?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1101.0s	1101.0	 Yeah, I have to agree with Saxie Poo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1103.0s	1103.0	 Elon is the Elon basically has had over the last 10 or 15 years an incredible amount of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1111.0s	1111.0	 challenges that he's overcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1113.0s	1113.0	 He's had an incredible amount of haters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1115.0s	1115.0	 He's had probably had to deal with stuff that most of us would have broken under.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1120.0s	1120.0	 And he just fought through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1122.0s	1122.0	 And the guy just basically bended all the haters until he crushed their souls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1127.0s	1127.0	 And I just think that that's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1129.0s	1129.0	 Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1130.0s	1130.0	 So Elon Musk is the hands down the biggest, biggest, most obvious winner of 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1136.0s	1136.0	 That's the obvious winner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1138.0s	1138.0	 I'll give a couple of runner ups here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1140.0s	1140.0	 I thought also on the runner ups after Elon Zoom beating Skype, Slack video, Google Hangouts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1148.0s	1148.0	 and fixing all their China issues and getting to a hundred billion dollar valuation is notable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1153.0s	1153.0	 Obviously, Amazon did a great job because of the pandemic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1157.0s	1157.0	 And then just as an oddball out there, I just thought Adam Silver and the NBA bubble was an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1163.0s	1163.0	 incredibly bold project that was executed so well and was such a delightful business moment and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1170.0s	1170.0	 also a cultural moment that you had the NBA shutting down during the pandemic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1176.0s	1176.0	 Remember that dramatic night on a Thursday night and they canceled the games and then they do the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1181.0s	1181.0	 bubble and it works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1182.0s	1182.0	 And that gave me hope that we could get through the virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1184.0s	1184.0	 So those were some of my other runners up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1187.0s	1187.0	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1188.0s	1188.0	 The biggest loser in business in 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1190.0s	1190.0	 Go ahead, Shamoff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1192.0s	1192.0	 Facebook and Google exiting the year with umpteen antitrust lawsuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1198.0s	1198.0	 I think morale must be pretty brutal over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1202.0s	1202.0	 There's no amount of money at some point that people are willing to get paid to walk in the door every day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1207.0s	1207.0	 and just have to deal with those kinds of accusations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1211.0s	1211.0	 And so for all the good in the world that they do, which so it just must be really tough that they have to deal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1217.0s	1217.0	 with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1218.0s	1218.0	 But those guys are I think are the biggest losers in business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1221.0s	1221.0	 Who do you got, Sax?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1223.0s	1223.0	 The small business person, whether it's restaurants, retail, hospitality, what have you, small business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1229.0s	1229.0	 people really took it on the chin this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1232.0s	1232.0	 I agree with Shamoff about companies like Google and Facebook losing esteem and the eyes of the public for good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1239.0s	1239.0	 reason, censorship, so on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1241.0s	1241.0	 But tech still are, stocks are at all time highs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1244.0s	1244.0	 The politicians got to keep eating at French Laundry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1247.0s	1247.0	 But it was the small business people who got absolutely decimated by these lockdowns, which don't even work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1253.0s	1253.0	 And so they are the big loser of 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1256.0s	1256.0	 Freeberg, what do you got?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1258.0s	1258.0	 I'm a little more vanilla than the rest of you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1260.0s	1260.0	 I went with AMC Entertainment Holdings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1263.0s	1263.0	 Talk about a fucked business in COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1265.0s	1265.0	 Restaurants at least you can do takeout.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1267.0s	1267.0	 You can't take out a movie from AMC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1269.0s	1269.0	 They're shut down all over the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1271.0s	1271.0	 Their creditors are telling them to declare bankruptcy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1273.0s	1273.0	 It's a total shit show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1275.0s	1275.0	 You think people go back to movies?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1277.0s	1277.0	 You don't think they go back?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1278.0s	1278.0	 I don't know what the hell AMC is going to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1280.0s	1280.0	 What do you do with all those theaters?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1282.0s	1282.0	 They're awesome. I love going to the movies, but I'm not going to the movies for at least another year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1286.0s	1286.0	 And it's sad because honestly, movies are a big part of my life, always have been.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1290.0s	1290.0	 And it's sad to see movie theaters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1292.0s	1292.0	 They're going to come back stronger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1294.0s	1294.0	 I think Amazon will buy one chain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1296.0s	1296.0	 I think Netflix buys the other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1298.0s	1298.0	 And then with your membership, you get to go and see all the range of stuff and maybe even see like Queen's Gambit in the theater a week before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1306.0s	1306.0	 It's such a great experience, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1308.0s	1308.0	 Yeah, I would have loved to see Queen's Gambit in the theater.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1310.0s	1310.0	 Totally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1311.0s	1311.0	 There's so much you could do with theaters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1312.0s	1312.0	 And I think there's an opportunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1314.0s	1314.0	 But man, did those guys get screwed this year?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1316.0s	1316.0	 Well, I always thought they should do an extended edition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1318.0s	1318.0	 So imagine if when HBO or one of those did, you know, Game of Thrones, if they had it out the day before in movie theaters or the week before or two days before, and they did an extra 10 minutes, people would love that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1330.0s	1330.0	 My biggest loser was, of course, same as David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1333.0s	1333.0	 Real world businesses, absolutely demolished.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1336.0s	1336.0	 And the government after that first stimulus, which was incredible, Trump did an amazing job of just dropping buckets of money, whether it was that PP loans and PPE loans, whatever the PPP loans, PPP loans, all this stuff was incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1350.0s	1350.0	 And then what complete utter bullshit and incompetence from our government that they couldn't get the second one done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1357.0s	1357.0	 It's absolutely fucking infuriating that the Democrats and the Republicans, these selfish fuckers couldn't get another billion dollars dropped.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1368.0s	1368.0	 And here we are in December.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1370.0s	1370.0	 That shit needed to drop in August or September, not December.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1374.0s	1374.0	 It's just absolutely disgraceful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1376.0s	1376.0	 They're just disgusted that they couldn't even get some more money to people who are suffering unemployment and these restaurants 100,000 restaurant closures by the end of 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1389.0s	1389.0	 It's just unconscionable that the stock market is ripping and we can't get just some money in people's pockets just drop the money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1398.0s	1398.0	 It's infuriating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1399.0s	1399.0	 We're sitting here at the taping of this that it might actually happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1402.0s	1402.0	 Okay, biggest winner in culture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1404.0s	1404.0	 Who's got a big winner in culture?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1406.0s	1406.0	 Everybody got one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1407.0s	1407.0	 I got the Black Lives Matter movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1411.0s	1411.0	 And I think it was such a meaningful and impactful kind of shift in how people were thinking fundamentally about behavior in society.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1424.0s	1424.0	 It's still persisting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1426.0s	1426.0	 There's corporate action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1427.0s	1427.0	 There's state action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1428.0s	1428.0	 There's regulatory action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1430.0s	1430.0	 And I think it's a meaningful movement that's going to persist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1434.0s	1434.0	 I think it came at a time when we all felt like a lot of people felt locked up in their homes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1439.0s	1439.0	 People were angry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1440.0s	1440.0	 People were frustrated with the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1442.0s	1442.0	 And it just was a very poignant moment, especially occurring during COVID, that it really took hold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1449.0s	1449.0	 And I think it's going to last.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1451.0s	1451.0	 And I think that the movement itself is going to spawn a lot of change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1455.0s	1455.0	 Yeah, I think it's well said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1458.0s	1458.0	 David, who do you got in culture?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1460.0s	1460.0	 Baby Yoda.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1462.0s	1462.0	 So you have pop culture on that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1465.0s	1465.0	 Yeah, Star of the Mandalorian show that has his ascent icon status helped Disney get 86 million subscribers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1475.0s	1475.0	 Grogu.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1476.0s	1476.0	 For Disney Plus, which just blew expectations and has established Disney Plus as the main rival to Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1484.0s	1484.0	 Do you think Netflix you think Disney will pass Netflix, correct?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1488.0s	1488.0	 I don't know if they'll pass them, but they're now certainly going to be a major rival to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1493.0s	1493.0	 I think they I think they passed them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1495.0s	1495.0	 Okay, Chamath, what do you got?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1496.0s	1496.0	 I would pick a combination of Fortnite, Roblox and Among Me, which I think has for at least a lot of high school and middle school kids.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1511.0s	1511.0	 But I may be a lot of adults, the only form of social interaction that we've had for an entire year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1518.0s	1518.0	 What a great what a great selection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1520.0s	1520.0	 And and I think it's important to understand how much lonelier we all would have been and how much more mental illness and depression we all would have dealt with if we couldn't have even just talked to our friends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1531.0s	1531.0	 And I think that there is something really beautiful that those games did for people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1534.0s	1534.0	 That's a good one. That's a good one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1536.0s	1536.0	 I went with podcasting, I think on a cultural basis, Joe Rogan and what's happening podcasting is long form discussions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1543.0s	1543.0	 Even this podcast has become just an amazing, amazing movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1548.0s	1548.0	 And people are having better discussions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1550.0s	1550.0	 And I consider it the antidote to what's happening on social media.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1555.0s	1555.0	 When people hear us discussing stuff on this podcast, they feel like they ate something nutritious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1561.0s	1561.0	 They had a great salad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1563.0s	1563.0	 They had some healthy food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1564.0s	1564.0	 And then when they're on social media and they consume the same tweets that we're doing, they feel like it's junk food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1569.0s	1569.0	 Right. And so I think that podcasting long form discussions, listening to each other, maybe, you know, Republicans and Democrats, left, right, everybody listening to each other and podcasting is just such a great medium for discussion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1584.0s	1584.0	 Who is the biggest loser on a cultural basis in 2020, Mr. David Sacks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1590.0s	1590.0	 The media, starting with the New York Times and other sort of elite media, they ripped the Empire Jersey off their backs to go after Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1598.0s	1598.0	 Well, they got him. But at what cost?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1600.0s	1600.0	 Half the country will never trust them again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1603.0s	1603.0	 This makes conspiracy theories more likely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1605.0s	1605.0	 It makes cultural divides deeper.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1607.0s	1607.0	 And they've been revealed to be corporate journalists, journalists who subscribe to and serve an agenda of their corporate masters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1616.0s	1616.0	 They've lost the public's trust.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1618.0s	1618.0	 Friedberg, what do you got on the biggest cultural loser?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1623.0s	1623.0	 Climate change took a backseat this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1628.0s	1628.0	 It you know, it had momentum as a as a cultural meme.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1632.0s	1632.0	 It's it's lost its its luster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1635.0s	1635.0	 And it's been shadowed a little bit this year with BLM and and COVID and lack of faith and institutions and all the other stuff that's been going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1644.0s	1644.0	 Do you think that people now when they see the collective response to COVID and the pen, the vaccines and our ability with science and technology to solve the pandemic, we will have a newfound appreciation for coordinated global action on global warming, David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1661.0s	1661.0	 I think you're asking me I think I think the I think the faith in institutions has eroded tremendously this year, the WHO telling people not to wear masks and then telling them a masks are good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1673.0s	1673.0	 The FDA that hits the I think just warming movement as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1679.0s	1679.0	 Yeah, I think the lack of faith in institutions as well as in the media makes it really difficult for things that require a coordinated effort and a coordinated cultural shift to take hold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1692.0s	1692.0	 You know, are really challenged in this new kind of model where where you don't know what to believe and you don't believe institutions and you don't believe old school and you don't believe states and you don't believe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1701.0s	1701.0	 You know anything structural anymore. So it's a scary it's a scary kind of moment. I don't know. I think climate change is going to have momentum with the new administration at least coming into office in the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1712.0s	1712.0	 But but generally like institutional guidance is lost its luster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1717.0s	1717.0	 What do you got?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1719.0s	1719.0	 Wokeness. Wokeness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1722.0s	1722.0	 I think when you now look at the realization of what we've gone through, people have realized that you know you can you can be extremely anti racist and think Latin X is just a stupid label.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1739.0s	1739.0	 You know you can be an entirely complete 100,000 million percent supporter of LGBTQ, but think that you know all these complicated pronouns aren't really necessary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1750.0s	1750.0	 And I think that people are coming to a point where you can have nuance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1757.0s	1757.0	 And I think that that's really important. I think that this whole cancel culture and wokeness was incredibly corrosive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1765.0s	1765.0	 And I think that that they lost.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1768.0s	1768.0	 I think it's actually a great. I think it's I think it's a great point you're making, Chamath, because on the last episode, I fumbled the word MX, which none of us have ever seen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1780.0s	1780.0	 We all laughed about it. And then I just had this little thing. I was like, Okay, I guess this is when I get canceled because I laughed at the fact that or I mispronounced it right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1790.0s	1790.0	 And the fact that I thought even for a second that mispronouncing this term MX, which I then did research on and I said, Does anybody know how to pronounce word Mx on Twitter?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1799.0s	1799.0	 So I figured I would preempt the dropping of the podcast by bringing it up on my Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1806.0s	1806.0	 And people are like, Are you trolling? I'm like, No, I'm asking. And I found videos and it turns out there is an actual controversy in the trans community where MX some people believe means mixed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1819.0s	1819.0	 Am I XED? Other people think it's MX as X the variable as in the variable X. And so they're having their own debate. They're figuring it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1829.0s	1829.0	 That's great. Everybody loves them. Everybody supports them. But the fact that I mispronounce it, you know, should I be canceling with that? Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1837.0s	1837.0	 Well, Jason, can I tell you, can I tell those people that are struggling with whether X equals anything or X equals mixed?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1845.0s	1845.0	 Just to touch upon Friedberg's point, the human race has caused 8% of all the species in the world to go extinct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1854.0s	1854.0	 And we have put another 22% of every single other species at the brink of extinction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1861.0s	1861.0	 At the same time, we have now expanded our footprint to touch 75% of the Earth's land surface.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1867.0s	1867.0	 So until somebody fixes those problems, I don't actually want to know what the X stands for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1874.0s	1874.0	 Yeah. I mean, we were this idea that we're going to cancel each other until we put stimulus checks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1880.0s	1880.0	 Put the fucking stimulus checks into people's hands. Get these small businesses back to work. Then you can tell me what the X stands for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1887.0s	1887.0	 Yeah. OK. My biggest loser on culture was the same exact as you, David. We're thinking similar. I have taken the red pill you gave me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1895.0s	1895.0	 I crushed it up. I've been snorting these the red pill like crazy. People think I'm turning into a Republican.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1900.0s	1900.0	 But I thought mainstream media and late stage journalism sacrificed objectivity specifically to get subscriptions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1907.0s	1907.0	 And they use the anti-Trump feelings and they worked them and got the ratings from them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1912.0s	1912.0	 And they literally use that. New York Times is the best example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1918.0s	1918.0	 I think the work you guys use for best example is canonical of like using the anti-Trump feelings to get people to take out their wallets and subscribe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1927.0s	1927.0	 Everybody realizes it. They drove out Barry Weiss. They drove out their editor of the page for making people feel unsafe with their words.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1935.0s	1935.0	 And then New York magazine drove out Andrew Sullivan and then Glenn Greenwald gets leaves his publication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1942.0s	1942.0	 I mean, anybody who descends inside of one of these publications, they cancel them inside of a publication for an opinion on an opinion page.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1949.0s	1949.0	 It's crazy. OK, let's keep everything moving here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1952.0s	1952.0	 Biggest turnaround in I guess this is biggest turnaround.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1956.0s	1956.0	 Anything but I did business. I'll lead off with mine. My best turn around was Airbnb.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1962.0s	1962.0	 They laid off 25 percent of the company in July.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1964.0s	1964.0	 Nineteen hundred of seventy five hundred employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1967.0s	1967.0	 They cut their marketing budget by eight hundred million and then they IPO five months later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1973.0s	1973.0	 And they had raised a billion dollars and eighteen billion dollar valuation according to Pitch Book and now worth eighty eight billion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1981.0s	1981.0	 Eighty eight billion a week after the IPO. That is a turnaround of all turnarounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1985.0s	1985.0	 David, who did you have?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1988.0s	1988.0	 This is where I had Joe Biden. He finished fourth in Iowa, fifth in New Hampshire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1993.0s	1993.0	 No candidate has ever bombed that badly in the first two contests and gone on to win the nomination.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=1998.0s	1998.0	 Biden roared back in South Carolina and then won big on Super Tuesday and wrapped up the party nomination by March.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2005.0s	2005.0	 Biggest political comeback ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2008.0s	2008.0	 Who do you got?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2010.0s	2010.0	 Freeburg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2012.0s	2012.0	 I got Airbnb as well. I mean from. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2015.0s	2015.0	 And here's the here's one of the craziest stats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2017.0s	2017.0	 They're sitting there in Q1 with a great business. Revenue drops 67 percent in Q2.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2022.0s	2022.0	 Can you just imagine the experience of 67 percent of your revenue going away in one quarter?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2028.0s	2028.0	 Cash burn skyrockets and just having to respond quickly and still maintain integrity with your customers and your employees as a leadership team.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2037.0s	2037.0	 I mean, it was an incredible leadership demonstration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2040.0s	2040.0	 It's a five along fire, right? I mean, it's literally you got to get everybody out of the building.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2044.0s	2044.0	 Here we go. I agree with that. I agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2048.0s	2048.0	 I agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2053.0s	2053.0	 Who do you got? Chamath. I'm curious. Who is your biggest?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2056.0s	2056.0	 Censorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2058.0s	2058.0	 Censorship. Censorship. Censorship existed in in draconian and the dark ages of our of our journey as a country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2066.0s	2066.0	 and in the world. And it came roaring back this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2069.0s	2069.0	 The amount of people that have been muzzled, stifled, the amount of fact and science that literally just gets judged willy nilly by our distribution points like Facebook and Twitter and Medium.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2081.0s	2081.0	 It's really scary. So censorship made a roaring comeback in 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2087.0s	2087.0	 I like it. I like it a lot. OK, now we go on to the biggest flash in the pan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2093.0s	2093.0	 You can interpret this any way you like. What do you got?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2096.0s	2096.0	 Saxy Poo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2099.0s	2099.0	 The WHO, the WHO. Nobody knew who the World Health Organization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2107.0s	2107.0	 Nobody knew what the WHO was before this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2111.0s	2111.0	 Then they have become, you know, somehow this global authority on covid despite getting everything wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2117.0s	2117.0	 They initially said that we didn't need to wear masks. They didn't update that until June 5th.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2121.0s	2121.0	 This was about 10 weeks after my blog saying that, you know, masks were a good idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2125.0s	2125.0	 They got the method of transmission wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2127.0s	2127.0	 They were saying that transmission mainly occurred through fomites, which is contagious surfaces instead of respiratory particles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2134.0s	2134.0	 They initially said that lockdowns work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2137.0s	2137.0	 Then they modified their policy on that because of its impact to marginal groups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2142.0s	2142.0	 And so the WHO has just gotten everything wrong this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2146.0s	2146.0	 And despite that fact, you now have to Chamos Point, Google, YouTube and even sites like LinkedIn or Nextdoor are now censoring people's statements if they contradict the WHO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2158.0s	2158.0	 Apparently without irony, because nobody has contradicted the WHO more than the WHO itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2164.0s	2164.0	 I look forward to next year when nobody cares about the WHO anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2170.0s	2170.0	 Great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2172.0s	2172.0	 Friedberg, what do you got? Flash in the pan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2174.0s	2174.0	 Flash in the pan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2177.0s	2177.0	 I put hydroxychloroquine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2179.0s	2179.0	 You guys remember?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2182.0s	2182.0	 It was going to save the world for a minute or two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2185.0s	2185.0	 And then, you know, here we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2188.0s	2188.0	 And so I'm just going to leave it at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2190.0s	2190.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2191.0s	2191.0	 Here we. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2192.0s	2192.0	 Everybody knows you may have heard of hydrochloroquine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2196.0s	2196.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2197.0s	2197.0	 Miracle. Some people say it's a miracle. I took it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2199.0s	2199.0	 Scrap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2200.0s	2200.0	 Chamath, what do you got?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2202.0s	2202.0	 It's actually quite related to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2205.0s	2205.0	 And I thought that she was marvelous, but I do think she will disappear off the scene, which is Sarah Cooper, which, you know, basically in the last month of the campaign, kind of just disappeared.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2217.0s	2217.0	 And now is I don't think anybody knows who Sarah Cooper is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2222.0s	2222.0	 And probably in a year from now won't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2224.0s	2224.0	 But for the period, for those dark months of the pandemic, her mockery of Trump was some of the funniest stuff on Twitter that I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2233.0s	2233.0	 Oh, Sarah Cooper is amazing. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2235.0s	2235.0	 She got a Netflix and I don't think she'll be a flash in the pan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2238.0s	2238.0	 I think she'll come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2239.0s	2239.0	 I would have loved to pick who was the press secretary for with the southern accent for Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2249.0s	2249.0	 Sarah Huckabee Sanders?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2251.0s	2251.0	 Yeah, Huckabee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2252.0s	2252.0	 She was, but I think she was gone in 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2256.0s	2256.0	 So I can't pick her, but she was amazing at defending Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2261.0s	2261.0	 She's like, you all are dumb and Trump is smart and he has 150 IQ and he owns Mar-a-Lago and he has a jet and his jet is bigger than your jet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2272.0s	2272.0	 And you are the fake news media.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2275.0s	2275.0	 And I don't care what you say, American public, don't know what you say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2279.0s	2279.0	 And Trump is amazing in bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2281.0s	2281.0	 He was banging porn stars when y'all were jerking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2284.0s	2284.0	 I mean, he's just, she would defend him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2286.0s	2286.0	 That's what I want as my PR person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2289.0s	2289.0	 She defended him for all time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2291.0s	2291.0	 My biggest flash in the plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2292.0s	2292.0	 I don't need a PR person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2295.0s	2295.0	 I don't need a PR person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2296.0s	2296.0	
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2296.0s	2296.0	 We got this podcast now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2297.0s	2297.0	 We don't need the press or PR.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2299.0s	2299.0	 We just go right to the audience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2302.0s	2302.0	 Nicola trading at $34 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2306.0s	2306.0	 They took your precious SPACs Chamath and they perverted it with a dipshit Milton who was on my podcast and couldn't answer basic questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2317.0s	2317.0	 It's now worth six billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2319.0s	2319.0	 I predict it will be worth 60 cents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2321.0s	2321.0	 I kid you not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2322.0s	2322.0	 This company will go to zero is my prediction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2325.0s	2325.0	 If you are buying companies and I made Jason's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2328.0s	2328.0	 You're going to scare all founder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2330.0s	2330.0	 All founder CEOs are going to avoid coming on your podcast now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2333.0s	2333.0	 No, no, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2335.0s	2335.0	 I'm delightful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2336.0s	2336.0	 But for this kid, he's under investigation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2341.0s	2341.0	 Is worth nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2342.0s	2342.0	 Yeah, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2343.0s	2343.0	 You're weak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2344.0s	2344.0	 No, he's under investigation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2347.0s	2347.0	 The things that disaster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2348.0s	2348.0	 They were obviously riding on Elon's coattails.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2350.0s	2350.0	 He couldn't make a decision if it was hydrogen powered cars or electric trucks or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2355.0s	2355.0	 And the company's in chaos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2358.0s	2358.0	 And I made a rule, which is if a company has not released their product and it's worth over a billion dollars, be careful because it could be a fraud or it could be a disaster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2369.0s	2369.0	 That's my biggest flash in the pan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2371.0s	2371.0	 Nicola biggest breakthrough freeburg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2373.0s	2373.0	 You want to start us off on this one?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2375.0s	2375.0	 I have an idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2376.0s	2376.0	 I think I know what you're going to say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2378.0s	2378.0	 I'm going to say Alpha Fold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2379.0s	2379.0	 You know that we talked about in the last podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2381.0s	2381.0	 I think Alpha Fold feels to me like what ARPANET was, which was the origins of the Internet, you know, back when it was first installed and no one really kind of grab grappled with the ramifications of what would emerge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2393.0s	2393.0	 And I think, you know, once we have the ability to design proteins to do things, a lot's going to change in the world of medicine and human health and longevity and the kind of environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2404.0s	2404.0	 And it's going to be pretty powerful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2405.0s	2405.0	 So I'm excited about Alpha Fold creating a foundation for humanity's ability to do those things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2410.0s	2410.0	 Jamoth, what do you got?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2412.0s	2412.0	 100% Alpha Fold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2413.0s	2413.0	 There's not a close second, to be honest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2417.0s	2417.0	 Okay, Sax?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2420.0s	2420.0	 Well, as a close second, I guess I would mention the mRNA vaccines, which we talked about on the show, the ability to basically print a vaccine in two days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2432.0s	2432.0	 And hopefully they will follow our advice about challenge vaccines the next time we have one of these pandemics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2437.0s	2437.0	 Challenge trials.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2438.0s	2438.0	 Challenge trials.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2439.0s	2439.0	 We can respond much more quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2441.0s	2441.0	 And then just quickly in politics, I thought the biggest breakthrough was Pete Buttigieg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2447.0s	2447.0	 He made the unlikely leap from mayor of South Bend, Indiana to being the first credible openly gay candidate for president.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2455.0s	2455.0	 He won Iowa sort of along with Bernie Sanders and was a very close second in New Hampshire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2462.0s	2462.0	 He's going to be the he's going to be the director of the transportation department in the Biden administration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2469.0s	2469.0	 By the way, Sax, I want to just point something out on your sorry, Jake, but you know, the mRNA vaccine technology has been around for like 15 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2479.0s	2479.0	 And regulatory barriers and regulatory constraints have largely kept this stuff from coming to market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2485.0s	2485.0	 And it's interesting how, you know, in a year where we have this pandemic emergency, we can take this technology that has been around and has been available to us for so long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2493.0s	2493.0	 And suddenly, you know, all the regulatory barriers get dropped and things come to market to change the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2497.0s	2497.0	 I think it's a great highlight of like what's possible when some regulatory constraints are diminished a little bit and technology is really allowed to flourish and see the light of day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2507.0s	2507.0	 And, you know, we all act so surprised that this technology works, but it's been here for a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2512.0s	2512.0	 It's pretty, pretty astounding that it hasn't worked or hasn't been allowed to work in the past.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2517.0s	2517.0	 In a previous, I think it's worth it. Yeah, I think it's a really valid one because it wasn't a breakthrough that occurred this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2523.0s	2523.0	 The breakthrough was they broke through the regulations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2526.0s	2526.0	 You said you wanted to wait and see some people get the vaccines first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2531.0s	2531.0	 And then that led to some accounts on the Twitter saying, are you still anti vaccination?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2538.0s	2538.0	 And I had to correct them that you've never said you were anti vaccination to be clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2542.0s	2542.0	 I'm not anti-vaccine, not at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2544.0s	2544.0	 No, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2546.0s	2546.0	 You said you wanted to wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2548.0s	2548.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2549.0s	2549.0	 No, no. I think my point is I think a lot of people are going to latch on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2553.0s	2553.0	 Sorry, let me just be really clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2554.0s	2554.0	 I think a lot of people are going to latch on to the small number of cases that are going to be amplified of people having adverse reactions to this new technology vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2564.0s	2564.0	 In Alaska the other day, like two days ago, there was a nurse who got the vaccine and she had a really bad anaphylactic reaction to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2570.0s	2570.0	 She had to be given epinephrine twice to survive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2572.0s	2572.0	 And she came out and she was fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2574.0s	2574.0	 But it's that storytelling that's like, you know, they assume it should be some small percentage of people will have some reaction to this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2582.0s	2582.0	 But that is the storytelling that will keep people from doing this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2584.0s	2584.0	 And I think that is the biggest kind of concern.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2587.0s	2587.0	 And that's why you've got guys like Mike Pence doing the vaccine tomorrow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2590.0s	2590.0	 You know, he's going to do it on live TV and celebrities like Ian McKellen doing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2595.0s	2595.0	 They're trying to kind of create a little bit of faith.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2597.0s	2597.0	 Wait, are we going to see Mike Pence's naked shoulder and bicep on television?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2601.0s	2601.0	 They're going to blur it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2603.0s	2603.0	 They're going to pixelate it because mom doesn't want to see that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2606.0s	2606.0	 Is mother going to be beside him?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2609.0s	2609.0	 That's his wife.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2610.0s	2610.0	 He calls his wife.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2611.0s	2611.0	 Actually, mother's going to give it to him because if a woman doctor gave it to him, it would be kind of like cheating because she stuck something in him, you know, and it's just not right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2620.0s	2620.0	 OK, I can't wait to take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2626.0s	2626.0	 If anybody doesn't want their vaccine, I will take it because I'm losing my mind in quarantine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2629.0s	2629.0	 I mean, for the love of God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2631.0s	2631.0	 Smartest business move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2633.0s	2633.0	 Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2637.0s	2637.0	 I think 2020 was the year of the SPAC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2642.0s	2642.0	 I think that it is an incredibly it's done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2648.0s	2648.0	 It's done something really, really, really important in the capital market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2652.0s	2652.0	 So that can you give Chamath his bestie award now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2656.0s	2656.0	 J.K.L. Yes, accepting his bestie award given to him by himself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2661.0s	2661.0	 Would you like an acceptance speech?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2663.0s	2663.0	 I would like to thank me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2668.0s	2668.0	 The smartest business move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2669.0s	2669.0	 Me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2671.0s	2671.0	 Sax, what was your smartest business move or the smartest business move in business?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2676.0s	2676.0	 Well, I'd like to thank Chamath for the SPAC thing, too, because I was in Open Door and I was in Porch and both of them are SPACing this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2683.0s	2683.0	 So I'm in desktop metal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2685.0s	2685.0	 I'm going to go with we have to agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2687.0s	2687.0	 Chamath is the best in business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2689.0s	2689.0	 You've you've what you've what all of our beaks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2691.0s	2691.0	 So, yeah, I mean, I mean, actually, if you think about it, I've done six deals this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2698.0s	2698.0	 Are we still talking about me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2700.0s	2700.0	 We have to play the music, you know, the walk on music on the Oscars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2709.0s	2709.0	 Oh, my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2710.0s	2710.0	 I think his second bestie is Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2713.0s	2713.0	 I wish I had been nominated three times, but this is the only bestie he's won.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2717.0s	2717.0	 I really wanted to be in that reality show with you and.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2724.0s	2724.0	 I mean, talk about dodging a bullet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2726.0s	2726.0	 We went with this trailer to the top five studios.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2732.0s	2732.0	 They all wanted it in the room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2735.0s	2735.0	 NBC says, we'll take it in the room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2738.0s	2738.0	 The head of NBC says, we'll take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2740.0s	2740.0	 We taped the pilot and then beeps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2743.0s	2743.0	 Whole career life blows up and thank the Lord that show didn't get on TV because.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2749.0s	2749.0	 I would have been executive produced by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2752.0s	2752.0	 And yeah, that would have been bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2755.0s	2755.0	 So no reality TV for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2757.0s	2757.0	 I had I had another smart business move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2759.0s	2759.0	 I just wanted to point out which was Salesforce buying Slack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2762.0s	2762.0	 I think it's brilliant for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2764.0s	2764.0	 I think they're going to look back on the 10 percent they paid of their capital for Slack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2768.0s	2768.0	 I think Slack will be more important than Salesforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2771.0s	2771.0	 Ultimately in business, it's a huge, the most important brand there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2775.0s	2775.0	 What a crown jewel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2776.0s	2776.0	 What a great, what a great move by Benioff and Brett Taylor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2779.0s	2779.0	 And I just think what a great asset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2782.0s	2782.0	 Totally be better for them than YouTube is for Google or Instagram is for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2786.0s	2786.0	 I think I think it's on that level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2788.0s	2788.0	 Actually, I think it's of that order of magnitude where the importance of those assets to those companies Slack will be to Salesforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2795.0s	2795.0	 Cost cost 20 times, 30 times as much, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2797.0s	2797.0	 So less upside, but less upside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2800.0s	2800.0	 But but in terms of like lock in and value and, you know, the prevention of churn over time, I think it's going to be huge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2807.0s	2807.0	 I mean, it could be at some point the company is Slack Salesforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2812.0s	2812.0	 Like Slack will be the preeminent brand there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2815.0s	2815.0	 David, did you go for this for Smartest Business Move?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2818.0s	2818.0	 I agree. I agree with both the ones you've already done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2821.0s	2821.0	 OK, I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to rattle one off real quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2825.0s	2825.0	 I think people miss this, but at the bottom of the market, Silver Lake did this massive debt deal into Airbnb, which if you'll remember is reminiscent to me of Warren Buffett, you know, giving five billion dollars to Swiss Re and Goldman Sachs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2837.0s	2837.0	 And he earned a 12 percent coupon and got warrants in both those companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2840.0s	2840.0	 And it just paid a tremendous return for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2843.0s	2843.0	 Silver Lake swooped into Airbnb in April, gave him a 12 percent debt deal for a billion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2848.0s	2848.0	 And they got warrants that the warrants today are worth about one billion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2853.0s	2853.0	 And this debt is probably worth three times what they put in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2856.0s	2856.0	 So in like five months, six months, these guys have basically turned a billion dollars of debt into four billion dollars of value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2863.0s	2863.0	 It was an incredible deal, incredibly gutsy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2866.0s	2866.0	 If you think about what we were all feeling in early April about the market and where the world was headed, we had no fucking clue for these guys to swoop in and do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2872.0s	2872.0	 I thought it was super impressive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2874.0s	2874.0	 The other one I had a couple on this because I just I want to rattle these off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2879.0s	2879.0	 Bill Ackman bought a fucking S&P put sorry, bought an S&P put for twenty seven million dollars that he sold for two point six dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2888.0s	2888.0	 He bought he bought credit default insurance on a whole strip of credit default insurance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2892.0s	2892.0	 Yeah. Yeah. But he turned a twenty seven million dollar insurance instrument into two point six billion of returns for his fund.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2899.0s	2899.0	 And he still didn't sell his portfolio. In fact, he bought at the bottom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2903.0s	2903.0	 And I mean, the the the foresight this guy had going into the down market ahead of March, he saw that the market was going to tank because of covid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2911.0s	2911.0	 He made a bet on it. It was a tiny bet for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2914.0s	2914.0	 But man, to turn twenty seven million and two point six billion in like 60 days or 90 days, unbelievable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2920.0s	2920.0	 And then he bought stock in his companies at the bottom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2923.0s	2923.0	 What a gutsy investor. And then I was anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2926.0s	2926.0	 Was there anything Fugazi on that with where he had gone on CNBC and talked and he did this whole big, you know, no, no, no, no longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2934.0s	2934.0	 Yeah, he did it afterwards. But I think he's I think he's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2938.0s	2938.0	 I think he's great. Yeah, I think it was it was incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2940.0s	2940.0	 And my third one, which we don't talk about a lot, is Larry Ellison bought a billion dollars of Tesla stock less than two years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2946.0s	2946.0	 That is now worth over 10 billion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2949.0s	2949.0	 And he did have me join the board. And, you know, you put your money where your mouth is and you take ownership.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2955.0s	2955.0	 And, you know, I don't know much about Larry, but there was a lot of naysayers about Tesla saying they were bubbly and overvalued at that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2963.0s	2963.0	 And it was really he did it in the middle of the Tesla Q shorting movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2968.0s	2968.0	 And now he can buy not just Lenai, but he could probably get Kawhi to go with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2973.0s	2973.0	 You can buy another island. Anyway, those were three gutsy bets that I thought were worth highlighting that that just really impressed me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2978.0s	2978.0	 And, you know, it's when the markets are down, when you're facing the abyss, when everyone else is telling you you're wrong and you make a big bet like that and it pays off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2986.0s	2986.0	 That's the kind of stuff that I think returns are made from and characters built.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2990.0s	2990.0	 And those are those are just really impressive moves for me that there's a lot of impressive moves this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=2995.0s	2995.0	 The tide went out and came back in real quick. So there were some dumb business moves as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3002.0s	3002.0	 Sacks, you got a dumb business move that was a highlight for 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3006.0s	3006.0	 The city of San Francisco biting the hand that feeds it for years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3012.0s	3012.0	 These politicians have been shitting on the tech community, acting like the tech community was somehow a parasite on San Francisco.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3020.0s	3020.0	 Well, you know, now because of covid, the tech community has the option to leave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3027.0s	3027.0	 You have a lot of people leaving and there are gigantic budget deficits for the city.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3031.0s	3031.0	 The schools have giant budget deficits. It's not clear how they're going to close these things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3036.0s	3036.0	 And it's looking more and more like it wasn't tech that was a parasite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3041.0s	3041.0	 It was the politicians who are the parasites and nobody knows how to fix the city of San Francisco anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3050.0s	3050.0	 Yeah. OK, dumbest business move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3054.0s	3054.0	 Chamath. I think it was one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3059.0s	3059.0	 I think it was probably for me the governor of California's handling of covid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3068.0s	3068.0	 Well, I guess that's more political than business, but well, no, I mean, it did impact businesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3073.0s	3073.0	 So I think you're I think I'll allow it. I'll allow it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3076.0s	3076.0	 I think that I think that what he showed was how naked partisanship was in decision making that had that should have been based on science, in fact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3086.0s	3086.0	 And the quality of the decision making just eroded every single decision that he made.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3092.0s	3092.0	 And then now, you know, as David said, it's kind of like you have this just just, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3099.0s	3099.0	 You have this moment where it's like, you know, the justy kick moment where he's eating at French Laundry the day after is basically shutting the whole world down again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3107.0s	3107.0	 It's it's very frustrating. So so I think that also is shutting down beaches.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3111.0s	3111.0	 Right. And then, you know, the stay at home orders and not letting people leave their house and go to a beach or eat outdoors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3119.0s	3119.0	 All that is is send them inside. They're going to have a party inside their house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3123.0s	3123.0	 Well, there is a great tweet. There's a great tweet that said, you know, I'm not allowed to go to the store.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3129.0s	3129.0	 I'm not allowed to go to the shopping center, but I'm going to take my child on a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3133.0s	3133.0	 And if anybody stops me, I'm just going to tell them I'm taking her to the nail salon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3137.0s	3137.0	 And the reason is because you couldn't walk to the park, but you could you could go to the nail salon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3143.0s	3143.0	 And so, you know, this tweet was just reminiscent of just how arbitrary and random this stuff was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3147.0s	3147.0	 And it had just so many downstream inkpacks. So I think that was a huge fail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3151.0s	3151.0	 And nobody loves hypocrisy. I picked my smartest business move with Salesforce buying slack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3155.0s	3155.0	 Conversely, I'm picking my dumbest business move with Slack's board selling slack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3159.0s	3159.0	 This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I understand they felt like maybe it was a great deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3165.0s	3165.0	 But I would have much rather them see seeing them do what I have to be honest with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3171.0s	3171.0	 To be honest with you, I mean, I left the board and I just don't know why.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3174.0s	3174.0	 I wish I could have gotten the call because I would have bought it. Yeah, I agree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3179.0s	3179.0	 I think network effects are incredibly unique assets. They're very, very rare.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3184.0s	3184.0	 I think we've all been around them. We've worked in them. David has David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3187.0s	3187.0	 The other David has I have Jason, you have it is the single most incredible momentum, momentum driver and, you know, sort of tailwind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3196.0s	3196.0	 And when it exists, you just never give it up. And so I agree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3199.0s	3199.0	 I would have bought slack if I could have if they would have given me a shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3202.0s	3202.0	 We write our winners and you appreciate network effects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3206.0s	3206.0	 If you look at what Jeff Lawson did at Twilio, he started with much less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3212.0s	3212.0	 I think he started with nothing. Start of nothing with Twilio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3216.0s	3216.0	 Jeff Lawson is a Sengrid and segment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3219.0s	3219.0	 Their market cap has gone 12. It was it's 12 X market cap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3225.0s	3225.0	 They went from twenty nine dollars a share to three hundred sixty five dollars a year in three years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3229.0s	3229.0	 They're at sixty billion. Slack should have been buying other companies with their equity and they and they should have built and rolled up all of the other hub spots or whatever else is out there that they could afford by Zendesk, whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3244.0s	3244.0	 I'm not sure that the M&A strategy was the hard part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3248.0s	3248.0	 I just think that it's when you're in the bowels of these companies, as we all know, it's super hard. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3253.0s	3253.0	 So, I mean, I don't think you can fail Stewart and the team.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3256.0s	3256.0	 But I think that somewhere along the way, just the realization of how special and unique that network effect was didn't happen because it would have given a different team a level of energy or comfort to kind of really go for the brass ring, as you said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3275.0s	3275.0	 And but, you know, hopefully they'll be able to execute it at Salesforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3278.0s	3278.0	 OK, did I get everybody's dumbest business move?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3281.0s	3281.0	 My dumbest business move was myself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3284.0s	3284.0	 So I will take I will take the award for being a schmuck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3290.0s	3290.0	 I think for me, me and anyone else that fucking hedged or shorted the market or sold during the dip in March, I learned the most valuable lesson I've learned in my investing career to date.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3304.0s	3304.0	 You just want to invest in whole shares in great businesses and not try and time markets because that's always a loser's game and a fool's errand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3311.0s	3311.0	 And I think, you know, worrying about the market going down or up, as long as you hold shares in great businesses, it doesn't matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3317.0s	3317.0	 Trading is not for me. It was stupid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3320.0s	3320.0	 And I just feel like a lot of people learned that lesson this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3323.0s	3323.0	 I've heard a lot of people that kind of freaked out and got out of the market and then they regretted it and tried to get back in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3328.0s	3328.0	 It was too late and yada yada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3330.0s	3330.0	 I read a document that someone wrote for me and she wrote this incredible quote that I had never heard from Buffett.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3340.0s	3340.0	 And I'll give it to you, Friedberg, because it's very apropos of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3344.0s	3344.0	 Buffett had this statement, which is that, you know, it's not about timing the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3350.0s	3350.0	 It is about time in market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3353.0s	3353.0	 And I just think that's so that's so beautiful because it's so simple, but it's basically summarizes exactly what you said, which is get in, close your eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3362.0s	3362.0	 And if you if again, unless for liquidity, you just don't ever sell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3368.0s	3368.0	 Yeah, it's a fool's errand to try to time the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3372.0s	3372.0	 Sit on your hands, ride your winners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3374.0s	3374.0	 And he always said, listen, if a business is on, if I own this business and I love it and it's at a discount, I should want to own more of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3382.0s	3382.0	 I believe that was another Buffett. I don't know the exact quote.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3385.0s	3385.0	 Let's go to Smartest Political Move and we'll go to our token Republican David Sacks for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3391.0s	3391.0	 Well, well, it's it's it's yeah, it's funny you identify me that way because my my smart the smartest political move goes to Congressman Jim Clyburn,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3401.0s	3401.0	 Democrat of South Carolina, for endorsing Joe Biden just before the South Carolina primary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3407.0s	3407.0	 A number of people on the Biden campaign were panicking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3410.0s	3410.0	 They wanted him to do it early because Biden had bombed in Iowa and New Hampshire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3415.0s	3415.0	 And Clyburn kept his powder dry and endorsed Biden at the absolute perfect time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3421.0s	3421.0	 It caused Biden to win South Carolina, and that led him to sweep on Super Tuesday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3426.0s	3426.0	 Jim Clyburn was the kingmaker of 2020 without him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3430.0s	3430.0	 Joe Biden would not be president. Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3432.0s	3432.0	 OK, who you got?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3434.0s	3434.0	 Freeburg. Smartest political move of 2020 was Joe Biden staying quiet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3439.0s	3439.0	 hanging out in his bunker and letting Trump do his own damage and do story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3444.0s	3444.0	 I feel like I feel like if you know that Biden knew that it wasn't his election to win,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3448.0s	3448.0	 it was Trump's election to lose. And I think he let him go out and lose it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3451.0s	3451.0	 And and that to me was smart advice and smart action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3455.0s	3455.0	 You know, sometimes he just he just he just slow played aces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3459.0s	3459.0	 He hit a set. He just checked and he watched him fire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3463.0s	3463.0	 Who do you got, Chamath? Smartest political move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3466.0s	3466.0	 Smartest political move, which you will not see until 2022 or 23,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3472.0s	3472.0	 but laid the groundwork this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3474.0s	3474.0	 And I thought it was brilliantly done was Nikki Haley,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3477.0s	3477.0	 who I think will be the Republican nominee for president in 2024.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3482.0s	3482.0	 And she did an unbelievable job of tricking Trump to believe that he was her supporter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3489.0s	3489.0	 then getting distribution and then basically subtly telling everybody that she thought that he was an idiot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3495.0s	3495.0	 And I thought that she was brilliant in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3499.0s	3499.0	 So she didn't look like a rat leaving the ship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3501.0s	3501.0	 She looked like, you know, a rebel or something getting off the.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3505.0s	3505.0	 I think I think if you want to find somebody to consolidate center right politics in 2024,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3513.0s	3513.0	 my money would be on Nikki Haley. All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3516.0s	3516.0	 I went with the smartest political move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3517.0s	3517.0	 I also went for the long game. Pete Buttigieg going on Fox recently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3522.0s	3522.0	 I think he did obviously a masterful job. You had that sex earlier,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3525.0s	3525.0	 but he started going on Fox and basically being really spicy with them and supporting the hell out of Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3535.0s	3535.0	 And then he gets himself this secretary of transportation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3538.0s	3538.0	 And I think he's set up to either be the VP or the presidential candidate in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3545.0s	3545.0	 And he's I think he's going to be one of the bright stars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3547.0s	3547.0	 I also would I think Andrew Yang did nothing happen for him this year, really.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3552.0s	3552.0	 I don't know. But I felt like he also is my understanding is he's going to run for mayor of New York.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3558.0s	3558.0	 That was another amazing political winner in all of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3562.0s	3562.0	 I don't know if anybody has feelings on either of those.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3565.0s	3565.0	 I love I love Andrew Yang. I think he's fabulous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3569.0s	3569.0	 He's coming on the pot. I pragmatic, pragmatic, centrist, smart, capable, competent listener.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3578.0s	3578.0	 He attracts it. He attracts a plurality of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3581.0s	3581.0	 Yeah. And I and I think he's spoken out against cancel culture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3586.0s	3586.0	 And so, you know, whenever I see somebody in the left speaking out against cancel culture and censorship like the way Chamath has that definitely to me elevates them in my book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3598.0s	3598.0	 Are you saying Chamath is someone from the left?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3600.0s	3600.0	 Well, it's amazing how much we agree on, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3603.0s	3603.0	 Well, I mean, I think that there's you have this left and right definitions which have become very hard to understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3608.0s	3608.0	 And I think what we have to get back to is the American principled idea of freedoms and opportunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3614.0s	3614.0	 Right. And I don't think either of the parties actually were representing that problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3619.0s	3619.0	 Dumbest political move of the year. I think I know where everybody's going to go with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3623.0s	3623.0	 Rudy Giuliani, Rudy Giuliani's press conference at the sex shop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3628.0s	3628.0	 I mean, just I mean, how amateurish is that group of people?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3634.0s	3634.0	 The Four Seasons gardening. We're going to be at the fourth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3638.0s	3638.0	 Were they were they trolling us and trying to get press for it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3640.0s	3640.0	 I don't understand that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3641.0s	3641.0	 Unbelievable. So you go with Rudy Giuliani for the dumbest political move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3644.0s	3644.0	 Sax, what do you got? I have a feeling I know what Sax got.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3647.0s	3647.0	 Well, I got I got a tie here between one was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3652.0s	3652.0	 Defund the police, you know, as a political slogan, the whole country, you know, the BLM movement had the whole country on its side after the the George Floyd video came out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3664.0s	3664.0	 Everybody was in favor of sensible reforms to control the use of force by the police.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3670.0s	3670.0	 And then they they introduced the slogan of defund the police.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3673.0s	3673.0	 And it scared voters across the country into voting for Republicans in Congress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3679.0s	3679.0	 And it probably cost Joe Biden, not the presidency, but Congress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3684.0s	3684.0	 And my tie, the other half of that was Donald Trump refusing to wear a mask or to endorse mass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3694.0s	3694.0	 He finally did it, but it was two or three months too late.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3697.0s	3697.0	 If he had just gotten on board with mass, it would have been a very easy thing to do politically, personally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3703.0s	3703.0	 That could have made the margin of difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3705.0s	3705.0	 He might still be president if he had gotten on board with mass about three months earlier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3711.0s	3711.0	 Freeburg, what was your dumbest?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3713.0s	3713.0	 I actually yeah, I put making masks political more broadly, both the left and the right pointing fingers about masks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3720.0s	3720.0	 I mean, this is like a human life issue and, you know, kind of shaming the Republicans for not wearing masks and making it about we're the right guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3730.0s	3730.0	 You're the wrong guys. Everyone should have avoided pointing fingers and avoided not doing it because the other side was doing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3737.0s	3737.0	 And it should have never, ever been allowed to become political.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3740.0s	3740.0	 It was pure science. It was about saving lives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3743.0s	3743.0	 And I think both sides are to blame for, you know, the Democrats tried to make the Republicans look bad because they were advocating for masks and they shouldn't have done that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3752.0s	3752.0	 And the Republicans should not have tried to avoid wearing masks because the Democrats were telling them to wear masks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3756.0s	3756.0	 And it was just a total cluster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3759.0s	3759.0	 Really sad and, you know, could have made a big difference for thousands of lives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3763.0s	3763.0	 I too put Trump not advocating for masks as my dumbest political move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3768.0s	3768.0	 I believe he nailed the stimulus that first stimulus where he just dropped the $1,200 checks and the PPP and everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3775.0s	3775.0	 He obviously nailed, you know, the Operation Lightspeed and the vaccines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3779.0s	3779.0	 He didn't get credit for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3781.0s	3781.0	 I don't know if that was political or not that they dropped them the week the weeks after the election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3786.0s	3786.0	 I think it was. I'm a little bit cynical about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3789.0s	3789.0	 But my God, is there nobody that this man would listen to?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3793.0s	3793.0	 And they must have all been telling him in unison, hey, dipshit, put the mask on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3799.0s	3799.0	 We'll win the election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3801.0s	3801.0	 The in July and August, the numbers started to go down precipitously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3805.0s	3805.0	 And everybody, Fauci, everybody with half a brain was saying, second wave is coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3810.0s	3810.0	 Wear masks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3812.0s	3812.0	 And he refused to take that stance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3814.0s	3814.0	 And not only did that, he doubled down like the moron he is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3818.0s	3818.0	 And started doing rallies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3820.0s	3820.0	 This person is such a complete idiot, grifter and just imbecile that he couldn't see the clear path to victory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3829.0s	3829.0	 And he was tempting fate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3831.0s	3831.0	 And of course, he winds up getting covid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3835.0s	3835.0	 I mean, the idiocracy of the moment is just so profound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3840.0s	3840.0	 He absolutely would have sailed into that second term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3843.0s	3843.0	 We were sitting here on this very podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3845.0s	3845.0	 And we all believed he was going to sail into the second term when the market started ripping back and the covid numbers went down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3851.0s	3851.0	 And because of the stupidity of not wearing masks, thank God we got him out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3856.0s	3856.0	 But to the families who lost loved ones, he's a murderer, period.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3861.0s	3861.0	 We're moving on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3870.0s	3870.0	 And then taking the polyclonal antibodies to heal himself and show the American population that it's just not that bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3876.0s	3876.0	 It was the best stunt, the best theater I've seen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3881.0s	3881.0	 And I don't know what the hell else could have beaten it this year.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3897.0s	3897.0	 He had the antibodies rushing through his body.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3901.0s	3901.0	 He was on speed, man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3902.0s	3902.0	 I thought the best.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3904.0s	3904.0	 I thought the best political theater was when the Democratic leadership did like the Colin Kaepernick one knee in Kinte Klotz at the in the rotunda of Congress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3917.0s	3917.0	 Can somebody, Nick, you just throw the picture up there.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3936.0s	3936.0	 I've never gone off in the same room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3942.0s	3942.0	 But the Kinte Klotz were just so over the top.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3981.0s	3981.0	 She basically does math and people are just I mean she's done this now two or three times where she just takes people down and she did it to Mnuchin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3991.0s	3991.0	 Like she was like, is today Tuesday?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3993.0s	3993.0	 He's like, you know, today's Tuesday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3995.0s	3995.0	 She's like, can you tell me if today's to head?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=3998.0s	3998.0	 She just destroys people like I just never seen anything like it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4010.0s	4010.0	 Well, yeah, I mean, so I thought the French Laundry photos, you know, all these politicians violating their own lockdown policies was some was some pretty good theater.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4024.0s	4024.0	 The Atcher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4026.0s	4026.0	 Yeah, you had Gavin Newsom and London Brie dining at French Laundry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4033.0s	4033.0	 You had Nancy Pelosi go into that hair salon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4036.0s	4036.0	 Any Republicans do something like that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4039.0s	4039.0	 Well, I would I would tell you if I knew of any of the Republicans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4044.0s	4044.0	 The Republicans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4045.0s	4045.0	 But yeah, but the Republicans haven't been supporting lockdowns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4047.0s	4047.0	 So, you know, look, if there was a Republican who was supporting Rose Garden Supreme Court where they had a super spreader event at the White House, but they weren't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4056.0s	4056.0	 But but that wasn't political theater because they weren't violating their own policies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4060.0s	4060.0	 They were saying that people could take the risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4062.0s	4062.0	 Got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4063.0s	4063.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4064.0s	4064.0	 I'm picking these politicians because because they're hip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4067.0s	4067.0	 Yeah, it's the it's the hypocrisy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4070.0s	4070.0	 The one I love the best out of all the hypocritical politicians was the one who was like, please say it was the governor of some place, Colorado or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4078.0s	4078.0	 He's like, please stay home with your family.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4081.0s	4081.0	 Do not travel for Thanksgiving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4083.0s	4083.0	 It's going to be too dangerous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4084.0s	4084.0	 And then they find out he did that tweet while at a Southwest gate going with his family to Thanksgiving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4092.0s	4092.0	 And they literally have pictures of him on his phone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4095.0s	4095.0	 And the picture was timed at the timestamp of the tweet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4099.0s	4099.0	 If I have my understanding correct, I forgot the guy's name, but there were so many of us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4104.0s	4104.0	 Well, let me give you another one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4105.0s	4105.0	 There was like the L.A. County Supervisor, Sheila Cool, cast the deciding vote to shut down outdoor dining in Los Angeles only to be photographed eating at a for Nio and Santa Monica two hours later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4118.0s	4118.0	 So it's just completely hypocritical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4120.0s	4120.0	 And, you know, this is why there could be a big recall next year in California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4125.0s	4125.0	 I think we have to put political theater as one category of just loathsome political theater because we're going on to worse political theater.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4133.0s	4133.0	 And the stuff we've seen has been pretty horrific.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4136.0s	4136.0	 I'm going to lead us off with my worst political theater, which was the banning of Tick Tock was absolutely the right thing to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4144.0s	4144.0	 And then they just handed it off as like a gift to Oracle to make money and maybe be their server farm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4150.0s	4150.0	 I don't understand. We were supposed to ban it and get it the fuck out of the app store.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4154.0s	4154.0	 And that was just terrible political theater.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4156.0s	4156.0	 Anybody else got more political theater that will put in our loathsome political theater?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4160.0s	4160.0	 Well, you, Jason, just so you understand that I'm being politically even handed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4166.0s	4166.0	 This is where I had Rudy Giuliani and his tour of self emulation from the press conference in front of the crematorium to the hair dye meltdown to the video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4188.0s	4188.0	 We need to hold on. I'm going to make I'm going to call an audible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4191.0s	4191.0	 I'm calling an audible here. We're going to have a new category to get it covered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4195.0s	4195.0	 Worst Rudy Giuliani moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4199.0s	4199.0	 Can we have a Giuliani award? Can we have the Giuliani award next year?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4203.0s	4203.0	 Yeah, Giuliani award for self emulation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4205.0s	4205.0	 What is the worst thing, the worst Giuliani moment?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4211.0s	4211.0	 Oh, I think I think the saddest moment was the in the Borat thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4216.0s	4216.0	 That was sad because you just felt you just felt like this is an old broken man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4221.0s	4221.0	 It was creepy and it was just sad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4224.0s	4224.0	 He was desperate and he was creepy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4226.0s	4226.0	 And it was Giuliani lifetime award.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4229.0s	4229.0	 The worst though was was actually if you listen to the testimony when he farted, it was really terrible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4236.0s	4236.0	 It was really terrible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4237.0s	4237.0	 Actually, if you listen to the testimony, you're just like, what is this guy saying?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4240.0s	4240.0	 It's out of control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4242.0s	4242.0	 Well, they also I think we have to cut into here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4245.0s	4245.0	 The poor woman sitting next to him, clearly in range.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4249.0s	4249.0	 She's in the blast zone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4253.0s	4253.0	 He rips it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4256.0s	4256.0	 He rips it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4258.0s	4258.0	 And she looks him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4261.0s	4261.0	 She gives him side eye.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4263.0s	4263.0	 But she is so like scared to react to such an obvious carpet bombing that she just keeps a straight face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4273.0s	4273.0	 But her eyes go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4275.0s	4275.0	 That was it must be a stinker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4280.0s	4280.0	 I mean, it was loud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4282.0s	4282.0	 It had resonance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4284.0s	4284.0	 It was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4285.0s	4285.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4286.0s	4286.0	 Can I give one?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4288.0s	4288.0	 Can I give one other example?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4289.0s	4289.0	 And I don't know whether this is best or worst theater, but but the the the congressional hearings with the tech CEOs where the senators grilled all the tech CEOs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4303.0s	4303.0	 And it was definitely it was definitely political theater.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4305.0s	4305.0	 But on the other hand, they all deserved it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4307.0s	4307.0	 And there's going to be more of it next year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4309.0s	4309.0	 OK, let's do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4311.0s	4311.0	 I put that I put that one as my as my worth political theater because I thought what was so depressing about it was how little the congressional the congresspeople actually understood of these businesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4323.0s	4323.0	 And they went off on rants and tirades about, you know, you're blocking Republican voice on Twitter and you're doing this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4331.0s	4331.0	 And none of it actually focused on, you know, the monopolistic practices that was the intention of the hearing in the first place when they actually got into those points, when they tried to talk about how the ad networks work and how targeting works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4340.0s	4340.0	 They didn't have any clue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4342.0s	4342.0	 I mean, the people inside these companies don't even know how it worked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4345.0s	4345.0	 And they built it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4346.0s	4346.0	 I mean, these I know I'll tell you, like, I just I just think it's really sad that that folks in Congress honestly are so disconnected from understanding technology and understanding, you know, modern business practices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4358.0s	4358.0	 And they can't actually, you know, tackle the real issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4361.0s	4361.0	 And it neither does the squat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4364.0s	4364.0	 I mean, AOC didn't understand what a tax break was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4367.0s	4367.0	 I mean, so even the young ones don't understand stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4369.0s	4369.0	 I mean, we just we're getting the worst possible representation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4372.0s	4372.0	 OK, now we're going to go to lightning round with our final two categories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4375.0s	4375.0	 Best meme for me, it was the funeral dancers, followed up by Michael Jordan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4380.0s	4380.0	 I took that personally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4382.0s	4382.0	 And I, of course, loved Chumot's mix up that one of you made.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4385.0s	4385.0	 Who do you got for who got best memes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4387.0s	4387.0	 And you got a best meme.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4389.0s	4389.0	 To been.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4391.0s	4391.0	 Oh, to been to been.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4393.0s	4393.0	 That's it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4395.0s	4395.0	 Forever a cautionary tale about what not to do on a Zoom call.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4398.0s	4398.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4400.0s	4400.0	 Yes, that would be arguably in political theater.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4404.0s	4404.0	 Let's say no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4406.0s	4406.0	 Anybody else got a meme?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4408.0s	4408.0	 Best or worst.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4409.0s	4409.0	 I mean, I think it's the best meme ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4412.0s	4412.0	 Anybody else got a meme?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4414.0s	4414.0	 Best or worst.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4416.0s	4416.0	 I like the funeral dancers, but the funeral dancers are pretty great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4419.0s	4419.0	 David, anything for you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4423.0s	4423.0	 I just want to say to everybody that's listening, I really hope that you guys have an incredible holiday and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4432.0s	4432.0	 we can put this year behind us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4433.0s	4433.0	 And I hope for all of you guys that have gone through hard times, just know that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4438.0s	4438.0	 you know, hopefully you got some friends to talk to and family to see and talk to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4442.0s	4442.0	 And we love you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4444.0s	4444.0	 And we really appreciate that you take the time to listen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4446.0s	4446.0	 And guys, I just want to say to you guys, I love you guys with all my heart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4449.0s	4449.0	 Thank you for helping me get through a very difficult year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4453.0s	4453.0	 Back at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4454.0s	4454.0	 And I was very touched by the birthday present you sent me last week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4458.0s	4458.0	 I was just.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4459.0s	4459.0	 Oh, you want to tell them what you got?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4460.0s	4460.0	 You want to tell them what you got, big boy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4462.0s	4462.0	 I mean, listen, I don't want to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4465.0s	4465.0	 I mean, I got a big crate at the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4468.0s	4468.0	 It was I was born in 1970 and he got some of the best wines from 1970 and put them in a box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4475.0s	4475.0	 And, you know, I literally had to put them on a shelf and say, do not drink these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4480.0s	4480.0	 These things cost as much as the test is in the driveways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4484.0s	4484.0	 I mean, some of these bottles are ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4486.0s	4486.0	 And I hope to crack them all open with you guys at the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4489.0s	4489.0	 And happy, honestly, happy, happy 50th birthday, big boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4493.0s	4493.0	 It's a big, big milestone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4495.0s	4495.0	 Well, you know, I was it was a little bittersweet, obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4498.0s	4498.0	 You know, I was going to have some kind of party or anything like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4500.0s	4500.0	 And then what made it particularly hard and challenging was the birthday was on Saturday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4504.0s	4504.0	 And my friend, Tony Shade, died on Friday on that day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4508.0s	4508.0	 And I had been dealing with Tony Shade being in a coma for the fives for the no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4514.0s	4514.0	 For 10 days before that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4515.0s	4515.0	 And then I found out that that afternoon that they tragically had to pull the plug or I assume that's what happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4522.0s	4522.0	 I shouldn't say that. I don't speak out of turn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4524.0s	4524.0	 But this has been a shitty year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4527.0s	4527.0	 And I really hope that anybody out there who is suffering from mental illness or struggling in any way, call a friend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4537.0s	4537.0	 And I think the reason this podcast has resonated with so many people and I hear this from people when they listen to the pod is our friendship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4544.0s	4544.0	 And they they they hear us talk and they hear us laugh and they hear us joke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4549.0s	4549.0	 And the value of friendship and the love and the joy and people just can't believe when Tramont says and men say to each other, they love each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4558.0s	4558.0	 And they can't believe that Saks almost is able to say it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4562.0s	4562.0	 And they think by episode 25, Saks will be able to say back to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4568.0s	4568.0	 But we'll try right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4570.0s	4570.0	 We'll see if we can close 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4572.0s	4572.0	 We're all going to say I love you, David Saks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4575.0s	4575.0	 And then let's just see if this can work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4578.0s	4578.0	 I love you, David Saks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4580.0s	4580.0	 I love you, David Saks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4582.0s	4582.0	 Back at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4584.0s	4584.0	 We'll take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4586.0s	4586.0	 We'll take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4588.0s	4588.0	 We'll take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4589.0s	4589.0	 I love you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4590.0s	4590.0	 Happy holidays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4591.0s	4591.0	 See you guys in the new year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4593.0s	4593.0	 See you in the new year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8Cub88m2U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=128&t=4594.0s	4594.0	 Bye bye, besties.
