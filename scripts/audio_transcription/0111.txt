https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=52.2s	52.2	 Slate the podcast that shall not be mentioned by the press apparently what do you mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=56.1s	56.1	 They just did a profile on us. Well, they did this is the conundrum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=61.0s	61.0	 It's so much of a phenomenon that we're the number one business and the number one tech podcast in the world hands down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=67.8s	67.8	 that the press
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=69.4s	69.4	 has a hard time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=71.4s	71.4	 giving us any oxygen because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=74.6s	74.6	 They want to hate us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=76.7s	76.7	 They want to cover it. You're saying they take the ideas but not the they don't want to cite it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=81.5s	81.5	 They don't want to cite it. They don't want to cite it. But anyway, shout out to slate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=85.0s	85.0	 Yeah, what I thought was interesting was the guy pointed out that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=88.0s	88.0	 We don't want to subject ourselves to independent journalists asking us independent questions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=93.0s	93.0	 therefore we go direct and that that's kind of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=96.1s	96.1	 The thing nowadays when everyone says they want to go direct it's because they don't want to be subject to independent journalists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=101.0s	101.0	 One might ask themselves why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=103.5s	103.5	 Subjects don't want to go direct. Yeah, exactly. You mean don't want to go to journalists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=107.4s	107.4	 Yeah, because it there's a there's a specific reason why principles the subject of stories do not want to have the press
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=114.7s	114.7	 Interpret what they're saying is because they don't feel they're getting a fair shake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=117.5s	117.5	 They feel like the challenge is that then we avoid independent scrutiny
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=122.2s	122.2	 Of our points of view and our decision. They're constantly writing hit pieces about us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=126.4s	126.4	 The the question is when we want to present our side of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=130.6s	130.6	 Do we need to go through their filter or not? Why would you go through their filter when it's always going to be a hit piece?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=136.9s	136.9	 Right. Well, they have a class
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=139.7s	139.7	 hatred of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=141.8s	141.8	 Basically of technology entrepreneurs and investors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=147.9s	147.9	 You're right jacob they don't hate you because you genuflect to their political biases you see if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=154.8s	154.8	 If you do what spf did which is basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=158.7s	158.7	 Agree with all of their biases then yes, they'll treat you better. That's the deal. That's how it works
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=164.5s	164.5	 And when you say they do specific large media outlets, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=169.3s	169.3	 He's not referring to fox chucker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=171.4s	171.4	 That nobody okay, you can name one i'll trade you i'll tell you what i'll trade you fox for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=176.8s	176.8	 msnbc and cnn and the new york times the washington post and the atlantic magazine and on and on and on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=182.1s	182.1	 You get a lot of mileage out of being able to name fox. The fact of the matter is maginne. Callie. Mm-hmm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=187.4s	187.4	 That's a podcaster. She's independent now. That's true. You can name one. I mean literally one outlet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=193.9s	193.9	 That is not part of this, you know mainstream media and they all think the same way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=199.4s	199.4	 There are very small differences in the way they think it's all about clicks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=202.9s	202.9	 It's all about clicks at this point and it's all about just about journalism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=207.1s	207.1	 And advocacy it's that combination what you're calling advocacy is bias
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=211.7s	211.7	 And activism it's activism. It's that's what i'm talking about activism journalism. Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=216.1s	216.1	 I think the draymond also highlights a really important point, which is you know, he started his podcast. It's become one of the most popular
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=223.3s	223.3	 forms of sports media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=225.3s	225.3	 And he can speak directly without the filtering and you know classification that's done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=230.5s	230.5	 By the you know journalist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=232.8s	232.8	 And it seems to be a really powerful trend the audience really wants to hear direct and they want to hear unfiltered raw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=239.7s	239.7	 Points of view and maybe there's still a role for I think the journalism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=244.7s	244.7	 Separate from that which is to then scrutinize and analyze and question and it's not journalism. This is activism. They're just activists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=251.6s	251.6	 Look, why does anybody there are also journalists out there sex, right? So actually well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=256.8s	256.8	 It depends what the topic is and what the outlet is, but fair enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=260.5s	260.5	 Actually, I would argue that most of these journalists are doing what they're doing for the same reason that we're doing what we're doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=266.1s	266.1	 Which is they want to have some kind of influence because they don't get paid very much, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=271.2s	271.2	 But the way they have influence is to push a specific political agenda. I mean they're activists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=276.1s	276.1	 They're basically it has become advocacy journalism. Yes. That's the term I coined for it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=280.1s	280.1	 It's advocacy. Did you guys see this brouhaha?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=283.2s	283.2	 Where matt eglisius wrote this article about the fed and about the debt ceiling?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=289.2s	289.2	 And through this whole multi hundred word thousand word
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=294.5s	294.5	 Home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=295.7s	295.7	 He didn't understand the difference between a percentage point and a basis point and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=302.1s	302.1	 Yeah, I did see that. Oh wow. So wait a second. You're saying the fed's raising 25 percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=310.2s	310.2	 That's a huge difference between a mortgage is going up 25 percent between a principal and an outside analyst, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=315.7s	315.7	 Like a principal has a better grasp typically of the topics and the material but you know the argument from a journalist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=322.1s	322.1	 The argument is something that within the journalist circle. He's considered the conventional wisdom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=327.3s	327.3	 I get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=327.6s	327.6	 But the argument from a journalist is that by having that direct access that person is also biased
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=333.4s	333.4	 Because they're an agent because they're a player on the field
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=336.1s	336.1	 They do have a point of view and they do have a direction they want to take things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=339.1s	339.1	 So it is a fair commentary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=341.2s	341.2	 That journalists can theoretically play a role, which is they're an off-field analyst and that don't necessarily bring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=347.2s	347.2	 I would argue they're less educated and more biased than we are that may or may not be true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=351.7s	351.7	 What the two of you guys are debating which is a very subjective take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=355.0s	355.0	 but the thing that is categorical and you can't deny is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=358.2s	358.2	 There is zero checks and balances when something as simple as the basis point percentage point difference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=365.6s	365.6	 Isn't caught in proofreading isn't caught by any editor isn't caught by the people that you know help them review this and so what that says is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=374.0s	374.0	 All kinds of trash must get through because there's no way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=377.4s	377.4	 For the average person on twitter to police all of this nonsensical content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=382.1s	382.1	 This one was easy because it was so numerically illiterate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=385.3s	385.3	 That it just stood out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=386.9s	386.9	 But can you imagine the the number of unforced errors?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=391.3s	391.3	 Journalists make today in their search for clicks that don't get caught out that may actually tip somebody to think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=397.8s	397.8	 A versus b that's I think the thing that's kind of undeniable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=402.1s	402.1	 Right. Yeah, you only need to an article. There's a very simple test for this if you read
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=408.1s	408.1	 Uh the journalists writing about a topic you are an expert on whatever the topic happens to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=414.0s	414.0	 You start to understand. Okay. Well on that story i'm reading
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=417.4s	417.4	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=418.5s	418.5	 That they understand about 10 or 20 or 30 percent of what's going on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=423.5s	423.5	 But then when you read stories that you're not involved in, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=426.0s	426.0	 You read a story about hollywood or I don't know pick an industry or or a region. You're not super aware of you're like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=431.3s	431.3	 Okay. Well, that must be 100 correct. And the truth is journalists have access to five to 20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=437.0s	437.0	 There is a name for it. Yeah, it's called the gel man amnesia effect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=439.6s	439.6	 You just plagiarized michael crighton who came up with that. Yeah, so you yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=444.5s	444.5	 But no, he's exactly right, but I think it's worse than that it's because now the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=449.1s	449.1	 Now the mistakes aren't being driven just by sloppiness or laziness or just a lack of expertise. I think it's being driven by an agenda
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=457.0s	457.0	 So just to give you an example on the slate thing the slate article actually wasn't bad. It kind of made us seem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=462.0s	462.0	 You know cool
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=463.2s	463.2	 The sub headline was a close listen to all in the infuriating fascinating safe space for silicon valley's money men. Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=470.4s	470.4	 But the headline changed so I don't know if you guys noticed this the headline now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=475.6s	475.6	 Is elon musk inner circle is telling us exactly what it thinks first of all like they're trying for clicks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=481.3s	481.3	 Yeah, it's so they're trying way too hard to like describe us in terms of elon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=486.2s	486.2	 Which you know is maybe two episodes out of 110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=489.3s	489.3	 But before inner circle the word they used was cronies and then somebody edited it because I saw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=495.6s	495.6	 cronies in like one of those tweet, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=499.4s	499.4	 Summaries. Mm-hmm. You know where like it does a capsule or whatever. Yeah, yeah, and those get frozen in time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=506.5s	506.5	 So, you know, they were trying to bash this even harder and then somebody took another look at it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=510.2s	510.2	 Well, here's what happened the i'll tell you what happens in the editorial process
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=513.9s	513.9	 Whoever writes the article the article gets submitted. Maybe it gets edited proofread whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=518.8s	518.8	 Maybe it doesn't even in some publications. They don't have the time for it because they're in a race
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=523.2s	523.2	 Then they pick there's somebody who's really good at social media. They picked six or seven headlines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=527.5s	527.5	 They ab test them and they even have software for this where they will run a test
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=532.3s	532.3	 Sometimes they'll do a paid test. They put five dollars in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=535.7s	535.7	 Ads on social media, whichever one performs the best. That's the one they go with so it's even more cynical and because people who read the headlines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=545.0s	545.0	 Sometimes they don't read the story, right? Obviously most people just see the headline they interpret that as a story
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=549.1s	549.1	 That's why I told you when they did that new republic piece on you with that horrific monstrous monstrosity of an illustration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=557.5s	557.5	 Don't worry about it. People just read the headline. They know you're important. Nobody reads the story anyway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=562.6s	562.6	 But it wasn't a bad article actually it was well written actually. I was in shock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=566.4s	566.4	 I was like who was this writer that actually took the time to write some prose that was actually decent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=571.2s	571.2	 Yeah, he had listened to a lot of episodes clearly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=573.5s	573.5	 That was a really good moment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=574.5s	574.5	 actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=574.8s	574.8	 That was great advice because you gave it to him and you gave it to me because both of us had these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=578.9s	578.9	 And jason said the same thing just look at the picture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=582.0s	582.0	 And if you're okay with the picture just move on and I thought this can't be true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=586.0s	586.0	 And it turned out to mostly be true. Yeah, but my picture was terrible. Yeah, but it's close to reality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=599.7s	599.7	 Was peter teal more poor, but that just shows how ridiculously biased it is, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=608.0s	608.0	 Hugh grant elon, let's pull that up one more time here. Elon looks like Hugh grant. I just kind of he does he's kind of not bad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=614.8s	614.8	 Kind of looks like Hugh grant and like nodding hill. I knew that article was going to be fine when the first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=621.3s	621.3	 You know item they presented as evidence of me doing something wrong was basically helping to oust chase the buddine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=627.7s	627.7	 Which was something that was supported by like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=630.4s	630.4	 70 of san francisco, which is a 90 democratic city. So not exactly evidence of some, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=638.7s	638.7	 Look at the headline
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=640.4s	640.4	 The quiet political rise of david sacks so convicts profit of urban doom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=644.7s	644.7	 I'm just letting you know people don't get past the six word in the image. Yeah, it's 99 percent of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=649.5s	649.5	 We're like, oh my god. Congrats on the you know, republic article. It could have literally been laurel. What do they call them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=655.0s	655.0	 Uh laurel ipsum, you know, like it could have just been filler words from their second graph down and nobody would know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=660.9s	660.9	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=661.8s	661.8	 But now apparently if you notice that san francisco streets look like, you know walking dead that apparently you're a profit of urban doom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=670.8s	670.8	 I mean people are so out of touch. I mean they can't even acknowledge what people can see with their own eyes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=676.0s	676.0	 That's the bias that's gotten crazy. And I don't know if you guys saw this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=680.4s	680.4	 really horrible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=682.0s	682.0	 dystopian video of an art gallery owner who's been dealing with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=686.1s	686.1	 Owning a storefront in san francisco, which is challenging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=689.3s	689.3	 And having to clean up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=691.3s	691.3	 feces and you know trash and whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=694.6s	694.6	 every day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=696.0s	696.0	 And I guess the guy snapped and he's hosing down a homeless person who refuses to leave the front of his store
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=703.6s	703.6	 Oh, I saw that I saw that just like the humanity in this is just insane like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=709.5s	709.5	 Really like you're hosing a human being down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=712.9s	712.9	 It's terrible who is obviously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=715.8s	715.8	 Not living a great life and is you know, I can feel for both of them jaycal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=719.6s	719.6	 I can feel for both of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=720.9s	720.9	 I agree that it's not good to hose a human being down on the other hand think about the sense of frustration that store owner has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=726.7s	726.7	 because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=727.7s	727.7	 He's watching his business go in the toilet because he's got homeless people living in front of him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=732.6s	732.6	 So they're both like being mistreated the homeless person's being mistreated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=736.9s	736.9	 Same more about the store owner say more the the homeless person's being mistreated the store owner's being mistreated by the city of san francisco
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=743.6s	743.6	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=744.7s	744.7	 Say more about the person's not in a privileged position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=747.6s	747.6	 That person probably the store owner the store owner he's probably fighting to stay in business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=752.9s	752.9	 I'm just saying i'm not saying that's right, but no, no i'm just i'm laying the rope
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=762.3s	762.3	 What you're trying to do is oh my god, look at this this homeless person being horribly oppressed no that store owner is a victim too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=769.4s	769.4	 Yeah, there's no doubt. It's horrible to run a business. What is that person supposed to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=774.0s	774.0	 No, wait, this is this is symbolic of the breaking down of basic society like these both of these people are obviously like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=782.9s	782.9	 It's just a horrible moment to even witness. It's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=786.1s	786.1	 Oh, it's like it's something jason. Do you have equal empathy for the store owner and the homeless person or no?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=793.8s	793.8	 Under no circumstances should you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=796.1s	796.1	 Hose a person down in the face who is homeless like it's just horrific to watch it's just inhumane
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=800.8s	800.8	 This is a human being now, but as a person who owns a store
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=804.0s	804.0	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=804.2s	804.2	 My dad grew up in the local business if people were abusing the store you're trying to make a living and you got to clean up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=809.8s	809.8	 You know, whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=811.4s	811.4	 Excrement every day which is horrific. Yes, and this is dystopian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=816.3s	816.3	 In that moment, the empathy is not equal. I think you have more empathy obviously for the person on the receiving end of that host
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=823.1s	823.1	 Okay, but in general
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=825.7s	825.7	 Our society has tons of empathy for homeless people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=828.8s	828.8	 We spend billions of dollars trying to solve that problem. You never hear a thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=833.2s	833.2	 About the store owners who are going out of business. So on a societal level
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=838.0s	838.0	 You know not in that moment, but in general the lack of empathy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=842.1s	842.1	 Is for these middle class store owners who may not be middle class working class who are struggling to stay afloat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=849.0s	849.0	 And you look at something like what is it like a quarter or a third of the storefronts in san francisco are now vacant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=855.2s	855.2	 I'm just shocked this person is running
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=857.7s	857.7	 The shocking thing is like this person is running an art gallery storefront in san francisco
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=862.2s	862.2	 Like why would you even bother? Why would you bother to have a storefront in san francisco? I mean everybody's left
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=867.1s	867.1	 It's just what do you mean? Why do you bother if you've opened a store?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=870.1s	870.1	 So what are you supposed to start to code all of a sudden?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=872.9s	872.9	 Well, no, I mean you would shut it down at some point and find an exit and do what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=876.4s	876.4	 Yeah, but the store has large fixed costs, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=879.0s	879.0	 So that may be an investment he made 10 years ago exactly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=882.8s	882.8	 At some point you have to shut down your store in san francisco the second you can get out the solution to everything jake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=887.4s	887.4	 L isn't go to coding school online and then you know, I didn't say it was i'm just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=891.7s	891.7	 But moving to another city is a possibility true a lot of folks in silicon valley
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=896.1s	896.1	 I think in this weirdly fucked up way do believe the solution to everything is learn to code
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=900.8s	900.8	 Or become an uber driver or learn to code get a gig job get a gig job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=907.5s	907.5	 The guy spent years building his retail business. I mean the thing is he's the most person camps in front
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=912.5s	912.5	 And the homeless and he calls the police the police don't come and move the homeless person the homeless person stays there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=916.6s	916.6	 He asks nicely to move customers are uncomfortable going in the store as a result
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=919.9s	919.9	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=920.2s	920.2	 I stopped going to certain stores in my neighborhood because of homeless tents being literally fixated in front of the store and I go to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=925.7s	925.7	 The store down the road to get my groceries or whatever. Like I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=928.9s	928.9	 It's not a kind of uncommon situation for a lot of these small business owners. They don't own the real estate. They're paying rent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=934.8s	934.8	 Uh, they've got high labor costs, you know, everything's inflating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=938.1s	938.1	 Generally city population is declining. It's a brutal situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=942.5s	942.5	 All around I think if everybody learns to code or drives an uber
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=946.8s	946.8	 The problem is that in the absence of things like local stores and small businesses you hollow out communities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=953.9s	953.9	 You have these random detached places where you kind of live and then you sit in your house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=958.5s	958.5	 Which becomes a prison while you order food from an app every day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=962.2s	962.2	 I don't think that is the society that people want so I don't know. I kind of want small businesses to exist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=968.1s	968.1	 And I think that the homeless person should be taken care of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=970.9s	970.9	 But the small business person should have the best chance of trying to be successful because it's hard enough as it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=975.6s	975.6	 The the mortality rate of the of the small business owner is already 90
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=982.0s	982.0	 It's impossible in san francisco. Let's just be honest. Like to run a storefront
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=985.6s	985.6	 Jaycow, stop trying to push people to listen. Yeah, you are because here here. Well, how am I general?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=990.7s	990.7	 I'm saying the guy i'm just shocked that the guy even has a storefront. I would have left a long time ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=994.4s	994.4	 You're showing a tweet that's a moment in time and you're not showing the 10 steps that led up to it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=999.5s	999.5	 Oh a thousand steps the five times he called the police to do something about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1004.2s	1004.2	 The lost customers the stuff that freeberg and jamoth were just talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1007.8s	1007.8	 Maybe there was physical conflict that we didn't see in that, you know, and he's resolving it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1011.8s	1011.8	 It's not who knows man. It's really hard to look at these videos and know what's going on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1015.1s	1015.1	 It's awful to see but man, we don't know it's awful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1018.3s	1018.3	 Actually, you want to know another reason why we can't solve this problem?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1021.2s	1021.2	 Is this the language we use around it the fundamental problem here is not homeless. Okay, it's addiction. It's addiction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1026.7s	1026.7	 You say you know this and it's mental illness schellenberger's done the work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1029.9s	1029.9	 It's like he said 99 of the people he talks to it's either mental illness or addiction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1034.5s	1034.5	 But we keep using this word homeless to describe the problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1038.1s	1038.1	 But the issue here is not the lack of of housing. Although that's a separate problem in california, but it's basically the lack of of treatment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1045.8s	1045.8	 Totally, so we should be calling them treatmentless and mandates around this because well and enforcement you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1050.5s	1050.5	 Yeah, not have you you can't have a super drug be available for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1055.5s	1055.5	 a nominal price and give people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1058.3s	1058.3	 You know a bunch of money to come here and take it and not enforce it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1061.1s	1061.1	 You have to draw the line. That's at fentanyl. I'm sorry fentanyl is a super drug. There's three alternatives is mandated rehab
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1068.9s	1068.9	 mandated mental health, uh or jail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1072.1s	1072.1	 or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1073.0s	1073.0	 You know housing services if you're not breaking the law
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1076.0s	1076.0	 You don't have mental illness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1076.9s	1076.9	 You don't have drug addiction and then provide those are the four paths of outcome here of success
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1080.9s	1080.9	 And if all four of those paths were both mandated and available in abundance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1085.7s	1085.7	 This could be a tentable problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1088.6s	1088.6	 Unfortunately the man the mandate I mean you guys remember that kevin bacon movie where kevin bacon was locked up in a mental institution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1096.2s	1096.2	 But he wasn't like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1098.1s	1098.1	 He wasn't mentally ill. It's a famous story. It's a famous. It's what's that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1102.3s	1102.3	 But no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1103.9s	1103.9	 famous story, I think you guys someone's probably gonna call me an idiot for for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1108.5s	1108.5	 for messing this whole thing up, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1110.8s	1110.8	 I think um, there's a there's a story where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1114.2s	1114.2	 mandated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1116.5s	1116.5	 Mental health services like locking people up to take care of them when they have mental uh mental health issues like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1123.3s	1123.3	 Became kind of inhumane
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1125.7s	1125.7	 And a lot of the institutions were shut down and a lot of the laws were overturned and there are many of these cases that happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1131.7s	1131.7	 Where they came across as like torturous to what happened to people that weren't mentally ill and so the idea was like let's just abandon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1138.5s	1138.5	 Nest you think about one thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1141.1s	1141.1	 Yeah, well, that's another one right and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1143.0s	1143.0	 It's unfortunate, but I think that there's some you know, we talk a lot about nuance in gray areas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1146.9s	1146.9	 But there's certainly some solution here that isn't black or white
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1150.1s	1150.1	 It's not about not having mandated mental health services and it's not about locking everyone up that has some slight problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1156.5s	1156.5	 But there's some solution here that needs to be crafted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1159.3s	1159.3	 Uh where you know, you don't let people suffer and you don't let people suffer both as the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1164.3s	1164.3	 The victim on the street, but also talking about a 51 50. I think like when people are held
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1170.2s	1170.2	 Because they're a danger to themselves or others kind of thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1173.0s	1173.0	 Right, but jake i'm just think about the power of language here if we refer to these people as untreated persons instead of homeless persons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1180.9s	1180.9	 And that was the coverage 24 7 in the media is this is an untreated person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1185.4s	1185.4	 The whole policy prescription would be completely different we'd realize there's a shortage of treatment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1189.9s	1189.9	 We'd realize there's a shortage of remedies related to getting people in treatment as opposed to building housing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1196.8s	1196.8	 But why why and laws that mandate it that don't enable it because if you don't mandate it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1202.4s	1202.4	 Then you enable the free reign and the free living on the street and the open drug markets and all this sort of stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1208.1s	1208.1	 There's a really easy test for this if it was if it was yourself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1212.0s	1212.0	 And you were addicted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1214.1s	1214.1	 Or if it was a loved one one of your immediate family members
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1216.9s	1216.9	 Would you want yourself or somebody else to be picked up off the street and held with a 51 50 or whatever?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1223.3s	1223.3	 Code involuntarily against their will because they were a danger. Would you want them to be allowed to remain on the street?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1229.7s	1229.7	 Would you want yourself if you were in that dire straits and the answer of course is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1234.2s	1234.2	 You would want somebody to intervene policy perspective on this jay cal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1238.1s	1238.1	 So let me ask you as our uh our diehard liberal on this show. No, i'm not a diehard liberal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1242.1s	1242.1	 No, no, he's an independent only votes for democrats, please get it right 75 percent of the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1246.7s	1246.7	 I voted democrat 25 25 right independent votes for democrats. Okay, it's 25 Republicans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1252.0s	1252.0	 Is it not that your individual liberties are infringed upon if you were to be quote picked up and put away?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1257.1s	1257.1	 You know my position on it is if you're not thinking straight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1260.1s	1260.1	 Uh, you're and you're high on fentanyl. You're not thinking for yourself and you you could lose the liberty for a small period of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1266.8s	1266.8	 72 hours a week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1268.9s	1268.9	 You know, especially if you're a danger to somebody, you know yourself or other people and in this case if you're on fentanyl if you're on meth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1275.6s	1275.6	 You're you're you're a danger to society
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1277.6s	1277.6	 I mean, I think if more I think if more people had that if more people had that point of view and had that debate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1281.7s	1281.7	 As sax is saying in a more open way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1284.1s	1284.1	 You could get to some path to resolution on just not in san francisco. It's not how it happened. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1289.9s	1289.9	 You guys know this we won't say who it is, but someone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1293.1s	1293.1	 In my family has some pretty severe mental health issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1296.7s	1296.7	 and the problem is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1298.9s	1298.9	 that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1300.1s	1300.1	 Because they're an adult you can't get them to get any form of treatment whatsoever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1305.6s	1305.6	 right, right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1307.6s	1307.6	 You only have the nuclear option and the nuclear option is you basically take that person to court and try to seize their power of attorney
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1314.4s	1314.4	 Which is essentially saying that you know individual liberties are gone. Yeah, and by the way, it is so unbelievably restrictive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1320.9s	1320.9	 What happens if you lose that power of attorney?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1323.8s	1323.8	 And somebody else has it over you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1326.8s	1326.8	 it's just a huge burden that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1329.7s	1329.7	 The legal system makes extremely difficult and the problem is a backstop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1334.3s	1334.3	 You know if the person's committing something illegal like camping out or doing fentanyl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1339.5s	1339.5	 Meth, whatever you can use the law as the backstop, you know against personal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1343.9s	1343.9	 All that person can do is really get arrested even that is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1346.9s	1346.9	 A high enough bar to actually get power of attorney over somebody the other thing that I just wanted you guys to know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1351.7s	1351.7	 I think you know this but just a little historical context is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1355.8s	1355.8	 A lot of this crisis in mental health started because reagan defunded all the psychiatric hospitals. He emptied them in california
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1363.5s	1363.5	 and that compounded because for whatever reason his ideology was that these things should be treated in a different way and when he got to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1372.2s	1372.2	 The presidency one of the things that he did was he repealed the mental health. I think it's called the mental health systems act
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1378.3s	1378.3	 mhsa
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1380.4s	1380.4	 Which completely broke down some pretty landmark legislation on mental health and it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1384.8s	1384.8	 And I don't think we've ever really recovered and that we're now 42 years onward from 1980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1389.6s	1389.6	 But or 43 years onward but just something for you guys to know that that's that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1394.2s	1394.2	 Well, that's breaking had a lot of positives. Yeah, but that's one definitely negative check in my book
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1399.6s	1399.6	 Against his legacy is his stance on mental health in general and what he did to defund mental health
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1404.6s	1404.6	 Well, let me make two points there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1406.7s	1406.7	 So i'm i'm i'm not defending that specific decision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1409.4s	1409.4	 There were a bunch of scandals in the 1970s and epitomized by the movie one flew over the cuckoo's nest with jack nickleson
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1415.8s	1415.8	 About the conditions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1417.8s	1417.8	 In these mental health homes and that did create a groundswell to change laws around that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1423.7s	1423.7	 But I think this idea that like somehow reagan is to blame when he hasn't been in office for 50 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1430.0s	1430.0	 As opposed to the politicians who've been in office for the last 20 years. I just think it's letting them off the hook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1435.2s	1435.2	 I mean gavin newson
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1436.8s	1436.8	 10 15 years ago when he was mayor of san francisco declared that he would end homelessness within 10 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1443.1s	1443.1	 He just made another declaration like that as governor. So I just feel like i'm not saying it's reagan's fault
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1449.3s	1449.3	 I'm just saying it's an interesting historical moment. I think it's letting I think it's letting the politics society needs to start thinking about changing priorities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1457.2s	1457.2	 We didn't have this problem of massive numbers of people living on the streets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1461.9s	1461.9	 10 15 years ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1463.0s	1463.0	 It was a much smaller problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1465.0s	1465.0	 And I think a lot of it has to do with fentanyl the power of these drugs has increased. Yes massively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1469.6s	1469.6	 there's other things going on here, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1472.8s	1472.8	 In any event, I mean you can question what reagan did in light of current conditions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1477.0s	1477.0	 But I think this problem really started in the last 10 15 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1481.0s	1481.0	 Like in in an order of magnitude bigger way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1483.6s	1483.6	 These are super drugs until people realize like these are a different class of drugs and they start treating them as such
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1489.6s	1489.6	 It's going to just get worse. There's no path
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1492.4s	1492.4	 Oh as far as I know reagan didn't hand out to these addicts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1497.1s	1497.1	 800 a week to feed their addictions. They can live on the streets of san francisco. No, no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1501.2s	1501.2	 That is the current policy of the city. I hear you all policy. All I just wanted to just provide was just that color that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1508.2s	1508.2	 We had a system of funding for the mental health infrastructure, particularly local mental health infrastructure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1514.1s	1514.1	 And we took that back and then we never came forward and all I was saying is i'm just telling you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1520.8s	1520.8	 We're that decision. I think that's part of the solution here is yeah, we're gonna have to basically build up shelters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1526.2s	1526.2	 We're gonna have to build up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1527.7s	1527.7	 And to support your point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1529.7s	1529.7	 The problem now for example is gavin newson says a lot of these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1534.0s	1534.0	 And now he's gone from a massive surplus to a 25 billion dollar deficit overnight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1540.0s	1540.0	 Which we talked about even a year ago because that was just the the law of numbers catching up with the state of california
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1546.9s	1546.9	 And he's not in a position now to do any of this stuff so this problem may get worse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1551.4s	1551.4	 Well, they did they did appropriate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1553.6s	1553.6	 I forget the number it's like 10 billion or something out of that, you know huge budget
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1556.9s	1556.9	 They had to solve the problem of homelessness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1558.4s	1558.4	 I would just argue they're not tackling it in the right way because what happened is there's a giant special interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1564.1s	1564.1	 that formed around this problem, which is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1567.7s	1567.7	 the building industry who gets these contracts to build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1572.1s	1572.1	 The quote, you know affordable housing or the industrial complex
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1579.1s	1579.1	 Ten units at a time on venice beach like the most expensive land you could possibly build because you get these contracts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1586.1s	1586.1	 From the government so there's now a giant special interest in lobby that's formed around this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1590.9s	1590.9	 If you really want to solve the problem, you wouldn't be building housing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1595.5s	1595.5	 On venice beach, you'd be going to cheap land
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1599.0s	1599.0	 Just outside the city and you'd be building scale shelters. I mean shelters that can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1604.9s	1604.9	 house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1605.8s	1605.8	 10 000 people not 10 and you'd be having
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1609.8s	1609.8	 Yes, yeah, but when treatment built into them right you'd be solving this problem at scale and that's not what they're doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1616.7s	1616.7	 By the way, do you guys want to hear this week in grift?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1619.9s	1619.9	 Uh, sure we're all in that's a great example of grift. I um, I read something today in bloomberg. That was unbelievable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1627.2s	1627.2	 There's about two trillion dollars of debt owned by the developing world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1632.9s	1632.9	 That has been classified
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1634.8s	1634.8	 By a non-profit the nature conservancy in this case as eligible for what they called nature swaps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1640.9s	1640.9	 So this is two trillion of the umpteen trillions of debt. That's about to get defaulted on by countries like belize ecuador
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1648.8s	1648.8	 sri lanka seychelles you name it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1651.9s	1651.9	 And what happens now are the big bulge bracket wall street banks and the nature conservancy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1658.8s	1658.8	 Goes to these countries and says listen, you know, you have a billion dollar tranche of debt. That's about to go upside down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1666.5s	1666.5	 And you're going to be in default with the imf. We'll let you off the hook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1670.9s	1670.9	 And you know, we will negotiate with those bondholders to give them 50 cents on the dollar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1676.9s	1676.9	 but in return
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1678.5s	1678.5	 You have to promise to take some of that savings and you know protect the rainforest or protect a coral reef or protect some mangrove trees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1687.2s	1687.2	 All sounds good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1688.8s	1688.8	 Except then what these folks do is they take that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1692.0s	1692.0	 repackaged debt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1693.4s	1693.4	 They call it esg. They mark it back up and then they sell it to folks like blackrock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1698.9s	1698.9	 Who have decided that they must own this in the portfolio?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1701.9s	1701.9	 So it literally just goes from one sleeve of blackrock, which is now marked toxic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1707.4s	1707.4	 Emerging market debt and then it gets into someone's 401k as esg debt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1713.4s	1713.4	 Isn't that unbelievable? So you convert your signal and buy some esg to make yourself feel good. Yeah, two trillion dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1719.7s	1719.7	 Here's all you know about esg is that exxon is like the number seven
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1724.7s	1724.7	 Like top rank company according to esg and tesla is even on the list disastrous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1729.9s	1729.9	 How crazy is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1731.3s	1731.3	 it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1732.7s	1732.7	 It's a complete game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1735.3s	1735.3	 All of those that we said this many times but each of those letters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1738.0s	1738.0	 Individually means so much and should be worth a lot to a lot of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1742.1s	1742.1	 But when you stick them together, it creates this toxic soup where you can just hide the cheese
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1747.3s	1747.3	 Yeah, I mean governance is important in companies. Of course the environment is important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1752.6s	1752.6	 Social change is important. I mean, but why are these things grouped together in this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1757.4s	1757.4	 It just perverts an industry jake l it's an industry of it's all done. Absolutely. All right speaking of griff's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1763.8s	1763.8	 Microsoft is going to put 10 billion dollars or something into chat gpt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1768.6s	1768.6	 Degenerate ai as i'm calling it now is the hottest thing in silica valley
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1774.4s	1774.4	 The technology is incredible. I mean you you can question the business model maybe but the technology is pretty well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1779.9s	1779.9	 I mean, yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1780.4s	1780.4	 So what i'd say is 29 billion dollars for a company that's losing a billion dollars and azure credits a year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1785.7s	1785.7	 That's one way to look at it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1787.3s	1787.3	 That's also a naive way to look at a lot of other businesses that ended up being worth a lot down the road
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1792.3s	1792.3	 I mean sure you can model out the future of a business like this and create a lot of really compelling big outcomes, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1800.4s	1800.4	 potentially, yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1801.9s	1801.9	 So microsoft is close to investing 10 million in open ai in a very convoluted transaction that people are trying to understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1808.9s	1808.9	 It turns out that they might wind up owning 59 percent of open ai but get 75 percent of the cash and profits back over time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1818.1s	1818.1	 49 49 percent. Yeah of open ai, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1821.9s	1821.9	 They would get paid back the 10 million dollars over some amount of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1826.1s	1826.1	 and this obviously includes azure credits, uh and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1831.3s	1831.3	 Chat gpt as everybody knows this um, just incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1836.1s	1836.1	 Demonstration of what ai can do in terms of text based creation of content and answering queries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1843.8s	1843.8	 Is taking the net by storm people are really inspired by it. Sax do you think that this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1849.5s	1849.5	 A defensible real technology do you think this is like a crazy hype cycle?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1855.5s	1855.5	 Well, it's definitely the next vc hype cycle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1857.7s	1857.7	 Everyone's kind of glomming on to this because vc really right now needs a savior just look at the public markets everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1863.4s	1863.4	 We're investing in this in the toilets. So we all really want to believe that this is going to be the next wave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1870.1s	1870.1	 And just because something is a vc hype cycle doesn't mean that it's not true. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1876.0s	1876.0	 As I think one of our friends pointed out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1878.9s	1878.9	 You know mobile turned out to be very real. I think cloud turned out to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1884.0s	1884.0	 I'd say very real social was sort of real in the sense that did lead to a few big winners
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1890.4s	1890.4	 On the other hand web 3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1892.7s	1892.7	 And crypto was a hype cycle. It's turned into a big bust vr falls into the hype cycle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1897.5s	1897.5	 I think we are probably a hype cycle so far. No one can even explain what web 3 is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1902.8s	1902.8	 in terms of ai
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1905.0s	1905.0	 I think that if I had to guess I would say the hype is real in terms of its
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1911.4s	1911.4	 Technological potential
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1913.1s	1913.1	 However, i'm not sure about how much potential there is yet for vcs to participate because right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1920.2s	1920.2	 It seems like this is something that's going to be done by really big companies. So open ai is basically a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1927.0s	1927.0	 It looks like kind of a microsoft proxy. You've got google. I'm sure we'll develop it through their deep mind asset
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1932.9s	1932.9	 That you know, i'm sure facebook is going to do something huge in ai
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1938.1s	1938.1	 So what I don't know is is this really a platform?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1941.5s	1941.5	 that starts to be able to benefit from I will say that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1945.4s	1945.4	 some of the companies we've invested in are starting to use these tools, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1950.3s	1950.3	 I guess I guess where I am is I think the technology is actually exciting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1955.7s	1955.7	 I wouldn't go overboard on the valuations. So I wouldn't buy into that level of the hype
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1960.9s	1960.9	 But you think there could be hundreds of companies built around an api for something like chat gbt dolly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1968.1s	1968.1	 Maybe yeah, I don't I don't think startups are going to be able to create the ai themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1973.5s	1973.5	 But they might be able to benefit from the apis maybe that's that's the thing. Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1978.2s	1978.2	 That's the thing that has to be proven out free. There's a lot of really fantastic machine learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1984.0s	1984.0	 Services available through cloud vendors today, right? So azure has been one of these kind of vendors and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1991.2s	1991.2	 Obviously open ai is building tools a little bit further down on the the stack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1996.4s	1996.4	 But there's a lot of tooling that can be used for specific vertical applications
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=1999.7s	1999.7	 Obviously the acquisition of insta deep by bio and tech is a really solid example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2004.1s	2004.1	 And most of the big dollars that are flowing in biotech right now are flowing into machine learning applications where there's some vertical application of machine learning tooling and techniques
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2013.6s	2013.6	 around some specific problem set and the problem set of mimicking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2018.9s	2018.9	 Human communication and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2021.7s	2021.7	 Doing generative media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2023.9s	2023.9	 Is a consumer application set that has a whole bunch of really interesting product opportunities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2028.6s	2028.6	 But let's not kind of be blind to the fact that nearly every other industry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2033.3s	2033.3	 And nearly every other vertical is being transformed today and there's active progress being made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2038.5s	2038.5	 in funding and getting liquidity on companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2042.2s	2042.2	 And progress with actual products being driven by machine learning systems and there's a lot of great examples of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2047.4s	2047.4	 so, you know the fundamental capabilities of large data sets and then using these kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2054.1s	2054.1	 Learning techniques in software and statistical models to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2058.0s	2058.0	 Kind of predictions and drive businesses forward in a way that they're not able to with just human knowledge and human capability alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2065.8s	2065.8	 Is really uh real and it's here today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2069.3s	2069.3	 And so I think let's not get caught up in the fact that there's this really interesting consumer market hype cycle going on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2074.9s	2074.9	 Where these tools are not being kind of you know, validated and generating real value across many other verticals and segments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2081.2s	2081.2	 Chamath when you look at this microsoft open AI deal and you see something that's this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2086.5s	2086.5	 Convoluted hard to understand. What does that signal to you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2090.7s	2090.7	 As a capital allocator and company builder, I would put deals into two categories
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2095.2s	2095.2	 One is easy and straightforward and then two is, you know cube by half or you know the two hard bucket
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2102.2s	2102.2	 This is clearly in that second category
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2105.0s	2105.0	 But it doesn't mean why is it in that category? Well, it doesn't mean that it won't work in our group chat with the rest of the guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2111.6s	2111.6	 One person said there's a lot of complex law
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2114.9s	2114.9	 when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2116.6s	2116.6	 Go from a non-profit to a for-profit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2119.3s	2119.3	 There's lots of complexity in deal construction. The original investors have certain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2124.3s	2124.3	 Things that they want to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2126.5s	2126.5	 There may or may not be you know legal issues at play here that you encapsulated well in the last episode
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2132.7s	2132.7	 I think there's a lot of stuff. We don't know so I think it's important to just like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2137.4s	2137.4	 Give those folks the benefit of the doubt. But yeah, if you're asking me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2141.2s	2141.2	 It's in the two hard bucket for me to really take seriously now that being said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2145.3s	2145.3	 It's not like I got shown the deal. So I can't I can't comment. Here's what I will say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2150.9s	2150.9	 The first part of what sac said I think is really important for entrepreneurs to internalize which is where can we make money?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2159.3s	2159.3	 The reality is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2161.7s	2161.7	 Well, let me just take a prediction. I think that google will open source their models because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2168.3s	2168.3	 the most important thing that google can do is reinforce the value of search
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2174.4s	2174.4	 And the best way to do that is to scorch the earth with these models
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2178.1s	2178.1	 Which is to make them widely available and as free as possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2183.0s	2183.0	 That will cause microsoft to have to catch up and that will cause facebook to have to really look in the mirror and decide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2190.1s	2190.1	 Whether they're going to cap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2192.4s	2192.4	 The betting that they've made on arvr
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2195.7s	2195.7	 And reallocate very aggressively to ai I mentioned this in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2199.7s	2199.7	 I did this lex friedman podcast, but that should be what facebook does and and the reason is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2205.1s	2205.1	 If facebook and google and microsoft have roughly the same capability in the same model
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2210.5s	2210.5	 There's an element
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2212.1s	2212.1	 Of machine learning that I think is very important which is called reinforcement learning and specifically it's reinforcement learning from human feedback
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2219.9s	2219.9	 Right. So these rlhf pipelines. These are the things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2223.8s	2223.8	 That will make your stuff unique. So if you're a startup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2227.3s	2227.3	 You can build a reinforcement learning pipeline how you build a product that captures a bunch of usage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2233.3s	2233.3	 We talked about this before that data set is unique to you as a company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2237.7s	2237.7	 You can feed that into these models get back better answers. You can make money from it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2242.4s	2242.4	 Facebook has an enormous amount of reinforcement learning inside of facebook every click
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2248.5s	2248.5	 Every comment every like every share
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2252.0s	2252.0	 Twitter has that data set google inside of gmail and search
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2257.6s	2257.6	 Microsoft inside of minecraft and hotmail. So my point is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2261.9s	2261.9	 David's right the huge companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2264.9s	2264.9	 I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2266.3s	2266.3	 Will create the substrates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2268.7s	2268.7	 And I think there'll be forced to scorch the earth and give it away for free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2274.2s	2274.2	 And then on top of that is where you can make money and I would just encourage entrepreneurs to think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2279.3s	2279.3	 Where is my edge in creating a data set that I can use for reinforcement learning that I think is interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2285.5s	2285.5	 That's kind of saying I buy the ingredients from the supermarket
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2289.7s	2289.7	 But then I can still construct a dish that's unique and you know, the salt is there the pepper is there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2295.6s	2295.6	 But how I use that will determine whether you like the thing or not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2299.1s	2299.1	 And I think that you know, that is the way that I think we need to start thinking about it interestingly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2304.6s	2304.6	 As we've all pointed out here open ai was started as a non-profit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2308.8s	2308.8	 The stated philosophy was this technology is too powerful for any company to own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2313.7s	2313.7	 Therefore we're going to make it open source and then somewhere in the last couple years they said well, you know what actually?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2318.8s	2318.8	 It's too powerful for it to be out there in the public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2322.0s	2322.0	 We need to make this a private company and we need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2326.1s	2326.1	 Get 10 billion dollars from microsoft. That is the the disconnect. I am trying to understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2331.6s	2331.6	 That's the most interesting part of the story jason. I think if you go back to 2014 is when google bought deep mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2338.1s	2338.1	 Yeah, and immediately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2340.1s	2340.1	 Everyone started reacting to a company as powerful as google having a toolkit and a team as powerful as deep mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2346.9s	2346.9	 Within them and that that sort of power should not sit in anyone's hands
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2350.5s	2350.5	 I heard people that i'm close with that are close to the organization and the company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2354.7s	2354.7	 Comment that they thought this is the most kind of scary threatening biggest threat to humanity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2360.2s	2360.2	 Is google's control of deep mind and that was a naive kind of point of view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2364.5s	2364.5	 But it was one that was close that was deeply held by a lot of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2367.3s	2367.3	 So reed hoffman peter teal elon musk a lot of these guys funded the original kind of open ai
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2373.3s	2373.3	 Business in 2015 and here's the link so i'm putting it out here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2376.8s	2376.8	 Um, you guys can pull up the original blog post do all those don't people who donated get stock in so what happened was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2383.7s	2383.7	 It was all in a non-profit and then the non-profit owned stock in a commercial business now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2388.1s	2388.1	 But your point is interesting because at the beginning the idea was instead of having google own all of this will make it all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2393.5s	2393.5	 Available and here's the the the statement from the original blog post in 2015 open ai is a non-profit ai research company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2401.1s	2401.1	 Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2406.3s	2406.3	 Unconstrained by a need to generate financial return
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2410.1s	2410.1	 Since our research is free from financial obligations. We can better focus on a positive human impact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2415.9s	2415.9	 And they you know kind of went on and the whole thing about sam
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2418.8s	2418.8	 Greg elon reed jessica peter teal aws
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2422.6s	2422.6	 Yc are all donating to support open ai including donations and commitments of over a billion dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2428.2s	2428.2	 Although we expect that to only be a tiny fraction of what we will spend in the next few years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2435.0s	2435.0	 Which is a really interesting kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2437.2s	2437.2	 If you look back historical perspective on how this thing all started seven years ago and how quickly it's evolved as you point out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2444.0s	2444.0	 Into the necessity to have a real commercial alignment to drive this thing forward without seeing any of these models open-sourced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2450.6s	2450.6	 And during that same same period of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2453.3s	2453.3	 We've seen google share alpha fold and share a number of other predictive models and and tool kits and make them publicly available
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2461.4s	2461.4	 and put them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2462.9s	2462.9	 In google's cloud and so there's both kind of tooling and models and outputs of those models that google has open-sourced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2469.8s	2469.8	 And made freely available and meanwhile open ai has kind of diverged into this deeply profitable profit-seeking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2476.8s	2476.8	 Kind of enterprise model and when you invest in open ai
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2480.9s	2480.9	 In the round that they did before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2482.9s	2482.9	 You could generate a financial return capped at 100x which is still a pretty amazing financial return
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2487.9s	2487.9	 You put a billion dollars in you can make a hundred billion dollars. That's that's funding a real commercial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2493.3s	2493.3	 Endeavor at that point well and then to it is the most striking question about this whole thing about what's going on in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2499.2s	2499.2	 ai and it's one that elon's talked about publicly and others have kind of sat on one side or the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2505.0s	2505.0	 Which is that ai?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2507.8s	2507.8	 Offers a glimpse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2509.3s	2509.3	 into one of the biggest and most kind of existential threats to humanity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2513.4s	2513.4	 And the question we're all going to be tackling and the battle that's going to be happening politically and regulatory wise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2520.0s	2520.0	 And perhaps even between nations in the years to come is who owns the ai who owns the models?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2525.3s	2525.3	 What can they do with it and what are we legally going to be allowed to do with it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2528.4s	2528.4	 And this is a really important part of that story. Yeah to build on what you're saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2531.9s	2531.9	 I just put in pie torch people don't know that's another framework
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2535.8s	2535.8	 pytorch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2538.2s	2538.2	 This was you know largely built inside of facebook and then facebook said hey we want to democratize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2543.7s	2543.7	 Machine learning and they made and I think they put a bunch of executives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2547.4s	2547.4	 They may have even funded those executives to go work on this open source project
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2551.9s	2551.9	 So they have a huge stake in this and they went
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2555.8s	2555.8	 Very open source with it and then tensorflow which you have an investment in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2560.9s	2560.9	 tramath
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2562.1s	2562.1	 tensorflow was inside of I don't I don't have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2565.7s	2565.7	 Investment in tensorflow we build tensorflow the public source came out of google and then you invested in another company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2570.9s	2570.9	 But we we're building silicon for machine learning. That's different right, but it's based on tensorflow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2576.8s	2576.8	 No, no, no, no, it's the the the founder of this company was the founder of tensorflow. Oh got it. Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2582.6s	2582.6	 I'm sorry not of tensorflow part of me of the of tpu which was google's internal silicon that they built
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2589.4s	2589.4	 To accelerate tensorflow, right if that makes sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2593.4s	2593.4	 And so that's the you know, I don't mean to be cynical about the whole project or not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2598.7s	2598.7	 It's just the confounding part of this of what's happening here. It reminds me. I don't know if you remember this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2604.3s	2604.3	 The biggest opportunity here the biggest opportunity here is for facebook. I mean they need to get in this conversation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2610.4s	2610.4	 Asap I mean to think that like look pytorch was like a pretty seminal piece of technology that a lot of folks in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2618.5s	2618.5	 In ai and machine learning were using for a long time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2622.7s	2622.7	 Tensorflow before that and what's so funny about like google and facebook is they're a little bit kind of like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2629.0s	2629.0	 They're not really making that much progress. I mean facebook released this kind of like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2634.2s	2634.2	 rando version of alpha fold recently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2637.2s	2637.2	 It's not that good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2640.7s	2640.7	 I think these companies really need to get these products in the wild as soon as possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2645.5s	2645.5	 It cannot be the case that you have to email people and get on some lists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2649.5s	2649.5	 I mean, this is google and facebook guys. Come on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2651.9s	2651.9	 Get going. This is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2653.9s	2653.9	 I think the big innovation of open ai sax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2657.9s	2657.9	 To bring you in the conversation. They actually made an interface and let the public play with it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2663.1s	2663.1	 To the tune of three million dollars a day in cloud credits or costs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2667.6s	2667.6	 Which by the way just on that my my son was telling me he's like hey dad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2671.5s	2671.5	 Do you want me to tell you when the best time to use chat gbt is i'm like, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2675.1s	2675.1	 He's like, yeah, my friends and I've tried we've been using it so much. We know now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2679.7s	2679.7	 When we can actually get resources? Oh, wow, and it's such an interesting thing where like a 13 year old kid knows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2686.3s	2686.3	 You know when it's mostly compute intensive that it's unusable and when to come back and use it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2691.1s	2691.1	 And when to come back and use it when the last time sax the technology became this mainstream and captured people's imagination
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2698.3s	2698.3	 this broadly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2700.4s	2700.4	 Let's check. It's been a while. I don't know maybe the iphone or something. Yeah. Yeah. Look, it's it's powerful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2705.5s	2705.5	 There's there's no question. It's powerful. I mean i'm of two minds about it because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2709.7s	2709.7	 Whenever something is the hype cycle. I just reflexively want to be skeptical of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2713.9s	2713.9	 But on the other hand we have made a few investments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2716.6s	2716.6	 in this area
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2718.1s	2718.1	 And I mean, I think it is powerful and it's it's going to be an enabler of some really cool things to come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2723.1s	2723.1	 There's no question about it. I have two pieces of more insider information
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2727.9s	2727.9	 One I have a chat gpt ios app on my phone one of the nice folks at open ai included me in the test flight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2735.5s	2735.5	 And it's the simplest interface you've ever seen but basically you type in your question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2739.5s	2739.5	 But it keeps your history and then you can search your history. So it looks sax like your ni message
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2745.3s	2745.3	 Basically and it has your threads and so I asked them. Hey, what are the best restaurants in yawnville?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2751.1s	2751.1	 In a town near nappa and then I said which one has the best duck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2755.5s	2755.5	 And it literally like gave me a great answer and then I thought wait a second
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2758.7s	2758.7	 Why is this not using a siri or alexa like interface?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2762.8s	2762.8	 And then why isn't it? Oh, here's a video of it. I gave the video to nick by the way jason this what you're doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2767.9s	2767.9	 Right now is you're creating a human feedback
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2771.1s	2771.1	 Reinforcement learning pipeline for chat gpt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2773.7s	2773.7	 So just the fact that you asked that question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2776.6s	2776.6	 And you know over time if chad gpt has access to your gps information
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2781.2s	2781.2	 And then knows that you went to restaurant a versus b
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2784.4s	2784.4	 You can intuit and it may actually prompt you to ask. Hey jason. We noticed you were in the area
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2790.3s	2790.3	 Did you go to botega if you did? How would you rate it one through five?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2793.9s	2793.9	 That reinforcement learning now allows the next person that asks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2797.1s	2797.1	 What are the top five restaurants to say? Well, you know over a thousand people that have asked this question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2801.8s	2801.8	 Here's actually the best answer versus a generic rank of the open web, which is what the first data set is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2808.3s	2808.3	 That's what's so interesting about this. So this is why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2811.6s	2811.6	 If you're a company that already owns the eyeballs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2814.6s	2814.6	 You have to be running to get this stuff out there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2817.6s	2817.6	 Well, and then this answer, uh, and you know cited yelp. Well, this is the first time i've actually seen chat gpt site
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2824.6s	2824.6	 And this is I think a major legal breakthrough. It didn't put a link in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2828.5s	2828.5	 But if it's going to use yelp's data, I don't know if they have permission from yelp, but it's quoting yelp here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2833.5s	2833.5	 It should link to french laundry botega and bouchon bouchon actually has the best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2838.9s	2838.9	 For the record and I did have that duck so I asked this afterwards to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2843.0s	2843.0	 You know in a scenario like this, but it could also if I was talking to it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2847.0s	2847.0	 I could say hey, which one has availability this afternoon or tomorrow for dinner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2851.8s	2851.8	 And make the phone call for me like google assistant does or any number of I was thinking about next tasks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2857.9s	2857.9	 This was an incredibly powerful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2860.2s	2860.2	 Display in a 1.0 product. I was thinking about what you said last week and I thought back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2865.7s	2865.7	 to the music industry in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2868.4s	2868.4	 in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2869.4s	2869.4	 world of napster
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2871.8s	2871.8	 And what happened was there was a lot of musicians. I think metallica being the most famous one famously suing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2879.4s	2879.4	 Napster because it was like hey listen like you're allowing people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2883.0s	2883.0	 To take my content which they would otherwise pay for there's economic damage that I can measure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2888.1s	2888.1	 That legal argument was meaningful enough that ultimately napster was shut down now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2892.0s	2892.0	 There are other versions of that that folks created including us at winamp. We created a headless version of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2898.6s	2898.6	 But if you translate that problem set here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2901.8s	2901.8	 Is there a claim that yelp can make in this example?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2905.6s	2905.6	 That they're losing money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2907.8s	2907.8	 That you know if you were going through google
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2911.4s	2911.4	 Or if you are going through their app
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2913.6s	2913.6	 There's the sponsored link revenue and the advertising revenue that they would have got that they wouldn't get from here now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2919.2s	2919.2	 That doesn't mean that chat gpt can't figure that out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2922.2s	2922.2	 But it's those kinds of problems that are going to be a little thorny in these next few years that have to really get figured out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2929.4s	2929.4	 This is a very if you are if you are a human reading every review on yelp about duck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2936.3s	2936.3	 Then you could write a blog post in which you say many reviewers on yelp say that busan is the best duck. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2943.4s	2943.4	 The question is like is gpt held to that standard or exactly or something different?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2949.6s	2949.6	 And and it's linking to it is linking to it enough. This is the question that i'm asking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2953.4s	2953.4	 I don't I don't know it should be because i'll argue it should be because if you look at the four-part test for fair use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2959.4s	2959.4	 Which I had to go through because blogging had the same issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2961.6s	2961.6	 We would write a blog post
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2963.7s	2963.7	 And we would mention walt mosberg's review of a product and somebody else's and then people would say oh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2967.8s	2967.8	 I don't need to read walt mosberg's in need of wall street journal subscription and we say well we're doing an original work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2972.2s	2972.2	 We're comparing two or three different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2975.7s	2975.7	 You know human is comparing two or three different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2978.6s	2978.6	 Reviews and we're adding something to it. It's a you know, it's it's not a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2983.0s	2983.0	 It's not interfering with walt mosberg's ability to get subscribers in the wall street journal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2987.4s	2987.4	 But the effect on the potential market is one of the four tests and just reading from stanford's quote on fair use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=2994.3s	2994.3	 Another important fair use factor is whether you're used to deprives the copyright owner of income or undermines a new or potential market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3001.4s	3001.4	 For the copyrighted work depriving a copyright owner of income is very likely to trigger a lawsuit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3007.2s	3007.2	 This is true. Even if you are not competing directly with the original work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3011.3s	3011.3	 And we'll put the link to stanford here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3013.2s	3013.2	 This is the key issue and I would not use yelp in this example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3017.1s	3017.1	 I would not open the yelp app yelp would get no commerce and yelp would lose this so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3021.5s	3021.5	 Chat gpt and all these services must use citations of where they got the original work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3027.4s	3027.4	 They must link to them and they must get permission. That's where this is all going to shake out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3031.0s	3031.0	 And I believe that's but forget about permission. I mean you can't get a big enough data set if you have to get permission in advance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3037.8s	3037.8	 Right, you just go out and negotiate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3039.8s	3039.8	 It's it's going to be the large data sets quora yelp
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3043.9s	3043.9	 The app store reviews amazon's reviews
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3046.5s	3046.5	 So there are large corpuses of data that you would need like craigslist has famously never allowed anybody to scrape craigslist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3053.1s	3053.1	 The amount of data inside craigslist as but one example of a data set would be extraordinary to build chat gpt on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3059.8s	3059.8	 Chat gpt is not allowed to because as you brought up robots.txt last week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3066.0s	3066.0	 There's going to need to be an ai.txt are you allowed to use my data set in ai and under and how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3071.8s	3071.8	 Will I be compensated for it? I'll allow you to use craigslist, but you have to link to the original post
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3078.5s	3078.5	 And you have to note that the other gray area that isn't there today but may
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3083.8s	3083.8	 Emerge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3084.9s	3084.9	 Is when section 230 gets rewritten?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3087.6s	3087.6	 Because if they take the protections away for the facebook and the googles of the world for the basically for being an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3093.3s	3093.3	 Algorithmic publisher and saying an algorithm is equivalent to a publisher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3098.4s	3098.4	 What it essentially saying is that an algorithm is kind of like doing the work of a human in a certain context
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3103.5s	3103.5	 And I wonder whether that's also an angle here, which now this algorithm which today david you use you said the example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3109.8s	3109.8	 I read all these blog posts. I write something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3112.4s	3112.4	 But if an algorithm does it maybe can you then say no actually there was intent there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3116.8s	3116.8	 That's different than if a human were to do it. I don't know my point is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3121.4s	3121.4	 Very complicated issues that are going to get sorted out and I think the problem with the hype cycle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3128.1s	3128.1	 Is that you're going to have to marry it with an economic model for vcs to really make money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3132.9s	3132.9	 And right now there's just too much betting on the cum. So to the extent you're going to invest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3137.1s	3137.1	 It makes sense that you put money into open ai because that's safe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3140.5s	3140.5	 Because the economic model of how you make money for everybody else is so unclear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3144.3s	3144.3	 Right. It's clear. Actually, I have it for business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3147.4s	3147.4	 I just signed up for chat gpt premium
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3149.8s	3149.8	 They had a survey that they shared on their discord server and I filled out the survey and they did a price discovery survey freeburg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3157.4s	3157.4	 What's the least you would pay the most you would pay what would be too cheap of a price for chat gpt pro?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3163.1s	3163.1	 And what would be too high of a price? I put in like 50 bucks a month was would be what I would pay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3167.2s	3167.2	 But I was just thinking imagine chat gpt allowed you freeburg to have a slack channel called research
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3175.0s	3175.0	 And you could go in there or anytime you're in slack you do slash chat or slash chat gpt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3180.5s	3180.5	 And you say slash chat gpt. Tell me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3182.9s	3182.9	 You know, what are the venues available in which we did this actually for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3188.2s	3188.2	 I did this for venues for all in summer. I could say what are the venues that seat over 3 000 people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3193.0s	3193.0	 in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3194.0s	3194.0	 Vegas and it just gave us the answer. Okay. Well, that was the job of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3198.2s	3198.2	 of the local
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3200.0s	3200.0	 Event planner they had that list now you can pull that list from a bunch of different sources. I mean, what would you pay for that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3206.9s	3206.9	 a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3209.0s	3209.0	 Well, I think one of the big things that's happening is all the old business models
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3214.2s	3214.2	 Don't make sense anymore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3216.3s	3216.3	 In a world where the software is no longer just doing what it's done for the last 60 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3222.3s	3222.3	 Which is what is historically defined as information retrieval? So you have this kind of hierarchical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3228.6s	3228.6	 storage of data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3230.3s	3230.3	 that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3231.4s	3231.4	 You have some index against and then you go and you search and you pull data out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3235.4s	3235.4	 And then you present that data back to the customer or the user of the software and that's effectively been how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3241.8s	3241.8	 all kind of data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3244.4s	3244.4	 Has been utilized in all systems for the past
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3247.8s	3247.8	 60 years in computing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3249.8s	3249.8	 Largely what we've really done is kind of built an evolution of application layers or software tools
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3255.4s	3255.4	 To interface with the fetching of that data the retrieval of that data and the display of that data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3260.3s	3260.3	 But what these systems are now doing what ai type systems or machine learning systems now do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3265.8s	3265.8	 Is the synthesis of that data and the representation of some synthesis of that data to you the user
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3273.0s	3273.0	 In a way that doesn't necessarily look anything like the original data that was used to make that synthesis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3279.3s	3279.3	 And that's where business models like a yelp for example or like a web crawler that crawls the web and then presents web page
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3286.2s	3286.2	 directories to you those sorts of models no longer makes sense in a world where the software the signal to noise is now greater
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3292.7s	3292.7	 The signal is greater than the noise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3294.6s	3294.6	 And being able to present to you a synthesis of that data and basically resolve what your objective is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3301.1s	3301.1	 With your own consumption and interpretation of that data, which is how you've historically used these systems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3306.6s	3306.6	 And I think that's where there's you know going back to the question of the hype cycle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3310.6s	3310.6	 I don't think it's about being a hype cycle. I think it's about the the investment opportunity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3315.2s	3315.2	 Against fundamentally rewriting all compute tools because if all compute tools ultimately can use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3321.4s	3321.4	 This capability in their interface and in their modeling then it very much changes everything and one of the advantages that I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3328.2s	3328.2	 businesses are going to latch onto which we talked about historically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3331.6s	3331.6	 Is novelty in their data in being able to build new systems and new models?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3336.7s	3336.7	 That aren't generally available example in biotech and pharma for example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3342.9s	3342.9	 having

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3347.8s	3347.8	 Experiments and running lots of experiments and having a lot of data against those experiments gives a company an advantage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3355.1s	3355.1	 In being able to do things like drug discovering we're going to talk about that in a minute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3359.1s	3359.1	 Versus everyone using publicly known screening libraries or publicly available protein modeling libraries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3365.5s	3365.5	 And then screening against those and then everyone's got the same candidates and the same targets and the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3369.8s	3369.8	 You know kind of clinical objectives that they're going to try and resolve from from that output. So, um, so I think novelty and data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3377.2s	3377.2	 Is is one way that advantage kind of arises but really, you know, that's just kind of you know, where's there an edge?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3383.5s	3383.5	 but fundamentally every business model can and will need to be rewritten that's

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3402.4s	3402.4	 What impact would it be if chat gpt took every court case?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3406.5s	3406.5	 every argument every document and somebody took all of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3411.8s	3411.8	 Legal cases on the legal profession and then the filing of a lawsuit the defending of a lawsuit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3419.1s	3419.1	 Public defenders prosecutors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3422.1s	3422.1	 What data could you figure out like if and like just to think in recent history look at chesa buddhine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3427.8s	3427.8	 You could literally take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3429.3s	3429.3	 every case every argument he did put it through it and say, you know versus an outcome in another state and you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3436.1s	3436.1	 Uh figure out what's actually going on with this technology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3439.7s	3439.7	 What impact did this have on the legal field that you are a non-practicing attorney? You have a legal degree? I I never practiced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3447.1s	3447.1	 Other than one summer at a law firm, but no, I think you passed the bar. What's that? I did pass the bar. Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3452.5s	3452.5	 Yes, I did. I yes, of course of course. Yeah, come on. You gotta be kind of dumb
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3462.3s	3462.3	 I may not have passed the bar, but I know a little shit enough to know that you can't look I I would be curious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3468.1s	3468.1	 in terms of a very common question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3472.1s	3472.1	 that a an associate at a law firm would get asked would be something like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3476.5s	3476.5	 You know summarize the legal precedents in favor of x right and that you can imagine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3483.6s	3483.6	 GPT doing that like instantly now. I think that the question about that. I think there's two questions one is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3490.5s	3490.5	 Can you prompt gpt in the right way to get the answer you want and I think you know tremoth you shared a really interesting video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3496.8s	3496.8	 Showing that people are developing some skills around knowing how to ask
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3501.2s	3501.2	 gpt questions in the right way exact prompt engineering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3505.5s	3505.5	 Why because gpt is a command line interface? So if you ask gpt a simple question about what's the best restaurant in?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3511.9s	3511.9	 You know napa it knows how to answer that but there are much more complicated questions that you kind of need to know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3517.8s	3517.8	 How to prompt it in the right way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3519.1s	3519.1	 So it's not clear to me that a command line interface is the best way of doing that. I could imagine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3523.8s	3523.8	 Apps developing that create more of like a gooey. So we're an investor for example on copy ai
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3528.2s	3528.2	 Which has been doing this for copywriters and marketers helping them write blog posts and emails and so, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3534.9s	3534.9	 Imagine putting that like, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3537.8s	3537.8	 Gooey on top of chad gpt. They've already been kind of doing this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3541.9s	3541.9	 So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3542.9s	3542.9	 I think that's part of it. I think the other part of it is on the answer side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3547.4s	3547.4	 You know, how accurate is it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3549.8s	3549.8	 Because in some professions having 90 or 95 or 99 accuracy is okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3556.6s	3556.6	 But in other professions you need six nines accuracy meaning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3560.2s	3560.2	 99.9999 accuracy, okay, so I think for a lawyer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3567.2s	3567.2	 Going into court, you know, you probably need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3570.4s	3570.4	 I don't know. I mean depends on on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3573.0s	3573.0	 Question versus a murder trial is two very different things. Yeah, exactly. So is 99 accuracy good enough is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3580.5s	3580.5	 95 accuracy good enough. I would say probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3583.6s	3583.6	 For a court case 95 is probably not good enough. I'm not sure gpt is at even 95 yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3590.2s	3590.2	 But could it be helpful like could could could the associates start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3594.2s	3594.2	 With chat gpt get an answer and then validate it probably. Yeah, if you had a bunch of associates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3601.0s	3601.0	 bang on some law model for a year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3604.2s	3604.2	 Again, that's that reinforcement learning we just talked about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3607.2s	3607.2	 I think you'd get precision recall off the charts and it would be perfect by the way, just a cute thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3613.0s	3613.0	 I don't know if you guys got this email
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3615.0s	3615.0	 It came about an hour ago from reid hoffman and reid said to me h-mouth. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3619.5s	3619.5	 I created fireside chat bots a special podcast mini series
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3625.0s	3625.0	 Where I will be having a set of conversations with chat gpt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3628.6s	3628.6	 So you can go to youtube by the way and and see reid having and he's a very smart guy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3633.3s	3633.3	 So this should be kind of cool
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3635.6s	3635.6	 And by the way chat gpt will have an ai generated voice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3639.1s	3639.1	 powered by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3640.6s	3640.6	 the text-to-speech platform play dot ht
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3644.9s	3644.9	 go to youtube if you want to see reid have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3647.5s	3647.5	 Have a conversation with chat gpt. I mean chmoth. We have a conversation with the two davids every week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3653.9s	3653.9	 What's the difference? We know how this is going to turn out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3657.6s	3657.6	 Hey, but actually so synthesizing. Um chmoth's point about reinforcement learning with something you said jcal in our chat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3664.3s	3664.3	 Which I actually thought was pretty smart. Well, that's first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3667.8s	3667.8	 Yeah, so i'm gonna give you credit here because I don't think you've said it on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3671.6s	3671.6	 This episode which as you said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3674.2s	3674.2	 That these open ai capabilities are eventually going to become commoditized or certainly much more widely available
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3681.0s	3681.0	 I don't know if that means that they'll be totally commoditized or there'll be four players
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3684.3s	3684.3	 but there'll be multiple players that offer them and you said the real advantage will come from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3690.3s	3690.3	 Applications that are able to get a hold of proprietary data sets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3694.2s	3694.2	 And then use those proprietary data sets to generate insights and then layering on what chmoth said about reinforcement learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3700.7s	3700.7	 If you can be the first out there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3702.7s	3702.7	 In a given vertical with a proprietary data set and then you get the advantage the moat of reinforcement learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3709.4s	3709.4	 That would be the way to create. I think a sustainable business just to build on what you said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3713.5s	3713.5	 This week is the jp morgan conference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3716.7s	3716.7	 Friberg mentioned it last week. I had dinner on wednesday with this really interesting company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3721.8s	3721.8	 based in zurich and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3724.2s	3724.2	 What they have is basically a library of ligands, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3727.7s	3727.7	 And so these ligands are used as a substrate to deliver all kinds of molecules inside the body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3733.2s	3733.2	 And what's interesting is that they have a portfolio of like a thousand of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3737.5s	3737.5	 But really what they have is they have all the nuclear medicine about whether it works
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3743.0s	3743.0	 So, you know, they're they target glioblastoma glioblastoma
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3746.7s	3746.7	 And so all of a sudden they can they can say well this ligand can actually cross the blood vein barrier and get to the brain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3752.4s	3752.4	 They have an entire data set of that a whole bunch of nuclear imagery around that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3756.1s	3756.1	 They have something for soft cell carcinoma. So then they have that data set so to your point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3761.6s	3761.6	 That's really valuable because that's real work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3764.8s	3764.8	 That google or microsoft or open ai?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3769.4s	3769.4	 Won't do right and if you have that and you bring it to the problem you can probably make money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3775.4s	3775.4	 You know, there's a business there to be built
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3777.8s	3777.8	 Just building on this conversation. I just realized like a great prompt engineer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3782.8s	3782.8	 Is going to become a title and an actual skill the ability to interface with these here you go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3787.5s	3787.5	 ai coding school 2.0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3790.1s	3790.1	 Well, no a prompt engineer somebody who is very good at talking to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3794.7s	3794.7	 These you know instances and and maximizing the result for them and refining the results for them just like a detective who asks great questions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3803.1s	3803.1	 The that person is going to be 10 or 20 times more valuable. They could be the proverbial 10x engineer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3810.2s	3810.2	 In the future of as a as in a company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3813.2s	3813.2	 And as we talk about austerity and doing more with less and the 80 less people running twitter now or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3819.8s	3819.8	 Amazon laying off 18 000 people salesforce laying off 8 000 facebook laying off 10 and probably another 10 000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3826.6s	3826.6	 What catalytic effect like could this have we could be sitting here in three or four or five years and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3832.6s	3832.6	 Instead of running a company like twitter with 80 less people. Maybe you could run it with 98 less people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3837.5s	3837.5	 Look, I think directionally. It's the the right statement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3840.6s	3840.6	 I mean, you know, i've i've made the statement a number of times that I think we move from this idea of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3846.6s	3846.6	 Creator economy to narrator economy where historically it was kind of labor economy where humans use their physical labor to do things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3853.7s	3853.7	 Then we were knowledge workers. We used our our brains to to make things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3859.3s	3859.3	 And then ultimately we kind of I think resolve to this narrator economy where the the way that you kind of can state intention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3866.2s	3866.2	 And better manipulate the tools to drive your intentional outcome the more successful you're going to be and you can kind of think about this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3872.2s	3872.2	 As being the artist of the past
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3874.2s	3874.2	 Da Vinci was um, so what made him so good was he was technically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3879.7s	3879.7	 incredible at trying to reproduce a photographic like imagery using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3885.3s	3885.3	 Using paint and there's these really great kind of museum exhibits on how he did it using these really interesting kind of like split mirror
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3893.8s	3893.8	 systems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3895.0s	3895.0	 And then the the better the artist of the 21st century the 20th century was the best user of adobe photoshop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3901.0s	3901.0	 And that person is not necessarily the best painter and the artist of the 22nd century isn't going to look like the photoshop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3909.1s	3909.1	 Expert and it's not going to look like the the painter. It's going to look like something entirely different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3913.9s	3913.9	 It could be who's who's got the most creative imagination in driving the software to drive new outcomes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3919.0s	3919.0	 And I think that the same analogy can be used across every market in every industry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3923.0s	3923.0	 However, one thing to note jcal it's it's not about austerity because the the the luddite argument is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3930.0s	3930.0	 When you have new tools and you get more leverage from those tools
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3933.3s	3933.3	 You have less work for people to do and therefore everyone suffers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3936.6s	3936.6	 The reality is new work emerges and new opportunities emerge and we level up as a species
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3942.2s	3942.2	 And when we level up we all kind of fill the gaps and expand our productivity and our capability set
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3947.2s	3947.2	 I thought what jcal was saying was more that google will be smaller didn't mean that the pie wouldn't grow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3952.0s	3952.0	 It's just that that individual company is run differently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3955.4s	3955.4	 But there will be hundreds of more companies or thousands more millions more. Yeah, that's sort of I I have an actual punch up for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3962.4s	3962.4	 Yeah, instead of narrative. It's the conductor economy. It's you're you're conducting a symphony. Oh a punch up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3969.4s	3969.4	 Punch up there, but I do think like we're gonna there's gonna be somebody who's sitting there like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3973.8s	3973.8	 Remember tom cruise in minority report as a detective was moving stuff around with a interface the in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3979.5s	3979.5	 You know with the gloves and everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3981.8s	3981.8	 This is kind of that manifested you could even if you're not an attorney you can say hey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3986.0s	3986.0	 I want to sue this company for copyright infringement. Give me my best arguments and then on the other side say hey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3991.0s	3991.0	 I want to know what the next three features I should put into my product is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3994.5s	3994.5	 Can you examine who are my top 20 competitors?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=3997.0s	3997.0	 And then who have they hired in the last six months and what are those people talking about on 20?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4000.8s	4000.8	 You can have this conductor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4003.1s	4003.1	 You know who becomes really good at that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4005.1s	4005.1	 Well the leveling up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4006.5s	4006.5	 Massive amounts of tasks. Yeah, the leveling up that happens in the book enders game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4010.7s	4010.7	 I think is a good example of this where the guy goes through the entire kind of ground up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4015.7s	4015.7	 and then ultimately he's commanding armies of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4018.3s	4018.3	 Spaceships and space and his orchestration of all of these armies is actually the skill set that wins the war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4024.8s	4024.8	 Yeah, you predicted that there would be like all these people that create these next-gen forms of content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4030.6s	4030.6	 But I think this reid hoffman thing could be pretty cool. Like what if he wins a grammy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4035.1s	4035.1	 For his you know computer created podcast mini series. That's what i'm saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4039.6s	4039.6	 The thing i'm really excited about when's the first ai novel going to get published by a major publisher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4044.3s	4044.3	 I think it happens this year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4045.7s	4045.7	 When's the first ai symphony going to get performed by major symphony orchestra?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4049.4s	4049.4	 And when's the first ai generated screenplay get turned into an ai generated 3d movie that we all watch and then the more exciting one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4055.9s	4055.9	 I think is when do we all get to make our own ai video game where we instruct the video game platform?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4060.9s	4060.9	 What world we want to live in?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4062.1s	4062.1	 I don't think that's happening for the next three or four years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4064.4s	4064.4	 But when it does I think everyone's got these new immersive environments that they can live in I have a question when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4070.1s	4070.1	 When I say live in I mean video game wise. Yeah, sorry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4072.5s	4072.5	 When you have when you have these computer systems just like to use a question of game theory for a second. They're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4078.2s	4078.2	 These models are iterating rapidly. These are all mathematical models. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4082.1s	4082.1	 Inherent in let's just say this the perfect answer right like if you had perfect precision recall
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4089.3s	4089.3	 If multiple models get there at a system-wide level everybody is is sort of like they get to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4095.2s	4095.2	 Game theory optimal. They're all at Nash equilibrium, right all these systems working at the same time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4100.4s	4100.4	 Then the real question would then be what the hell do you do then?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4105.0s	4105.0	 Because if you keep getting the same answer if everybody then knows how to ask the exact right question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4109.8s	4109.8	 And you start to go through these iterations where you're like, maybe there is a dystopian hellscape
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4114.0s	4114.0	 Where there are no jobs maybe that's the Elon world which is you can you can recursively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4120.2s	4120.2	 Find a logical argument where there is no job. That's possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4125.1s	4125.1	 Right, and now i'm not saying that that path is the likely path
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4128.6s	4128.6	 But i'm saying it is important to keep in mind that that path of outcomes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4131.8s	4131.8	 Is still very important to keep in the back of our mind as we figure these things out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4136.2s	4136.2	 Well freeberg, you know you were asking before about this like you know, will more work be created?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4141.0s	4141.0	 Of course artistic pursuits at podcasting is a job now being an influencer is a job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4145.8s	4145.8	 yada yada new things emerge in the world, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4148.5s	4148.5	 Here in the united states in 1970 i'm looking at um, fred. I'm looking at the st louis fed 1970 26.4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4156.3s	4156.3	 Of the country was working in a factory was working in manufacturing. You want to guess what that is?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4163.0s	4163.0	 in 2012
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4165.0s	4165.0	 Sorry, what percentage it was 26
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4168.2s	4168.2	 Percentage of the country was working in a factory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4170.7s	4170.7	 26% in 1970 and in 2015 when they stopped the percentage in manufacturing i say it's they discontinued this it was a 10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4178.4s	4178.4	 So it's possible we could just see you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4182.1s	4182.1	 The concept of office work the concept of knowledge work is going to follow pretty inevitable the path of manufacturing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4190.5s	4190.5	 That that seems like a pretty logical theory or no?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4195.0s	4195.0	 I think we should move on but yes, okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4197.4s	4197.4	 So how would we like to ruin the show now should we talk about biden and uh the documents and ruin the show with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4203.3s	4203.3	 Political talk or should we talk about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4207.9s	4207.9	 Since it's been such a great episode so far. What do we want to talk about next?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4211.9s	4211.9	 I'll give you a couple choices. Don't want to talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4216.3s	4216.3	 Uh, so we're talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4219.1s	4219.1	 Give it to him. Give it to him. Give it to him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4221.7s	4221.7	 We all know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4223.7s	4223.7	 Air glasses, hold on a second. We all know jay cal that according to you when a president is in possession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4230.9s	4230.9	 Of classified documents in his home. Yes, apparently have been taken in an unauthorized manner basically stolen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4237.8s	4237.8	 He should have his home raided by the fbi almost close
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4242.0s	4242.0	 close, uh if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4244.5s	4244.5	 so anyway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4246.0s	4246.0	 the biden, uh as of the taping of this has now said there's a third batch of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4252.9s	4252.9	 Classified documents this group I guess there was one at an office one at a library
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4257.4s	4257.4	 Now this third group is in his garage with his corvette
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4260.3s	4260.3	 Certainly not looking good. Uh, and they say they say in his defense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4264.1s	4264.1	 They say the garage was locked meaning that uh, you could use a garage door opener to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4269.1s	4269.1	 To open or close it. That's it was locked when it went closed. So pretty much as secure as the documents at mar-a-lago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4275.8s	4275.8	 Same equivalency. No, no, no, I actually I mean just to be perfectly fair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4279.8s	4279.8	 The documents in mar-a-lago were locked in a basement the fbi came checked it out said we'd like you to lock those up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4285.3s	4285.3	 They locked them up. So got it a little safer than maybe a little safer than in the trunk of your corvette
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4291.1s	4291.1	 But functionally the same functionally the same. Uh, the only difference here would be what sacks when you look at these two cases
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4299.3s	4299.3	 Well that in one case merrick garland has appointed an independent counsel to investigate trump and there's no such a special counsel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4307.0s	4307.0	 Or investigator appointed to investigate biden. I mean, yeah, these things are functionally put somebody on it though. Wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4314.3s	4314.3	 I don't think they've appointed a special counsel yet. No, they did as of an hour ago a special counsel was appointed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4320.2s	4320.2	 Okay, did that just happen? Yeah, one hour ago. Uh robert hers is named. Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4324.2s	4324.2	 I guess there are real questions to look into here. The documents apparently were moved twice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4330.1s	4330.1	 Why were they moved who ordered that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4332.6s	4332.6	 What was a classified document doing in biden's personal library?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4336.6s	4336.6	 What do the documents pertain to?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4339.6s	4339.6	 Do they touch on the biden family's business dealings in ukraine and china? So there are real things to look into here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4345.7s	4345.7	 But let me just take a step back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4348.9s	4348.9	 Now that the last three presidential candidates have been ensnared
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4353.3s	4353.3	 In these classified document problems. Remember
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4356.9s	4356.9	 It's biden now and then trump and hillary clinton before trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4362.0s	4362.0	 I think it's time to step back and ask
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4364.9s	4364.9	 Are we over classifying documents? I mean are we fetishizing these documents? Are they all really that sensitive?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4371.8s	4371.8	 it seems to me that we have an over classification problem meaning that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4376.6s	4376.6	 ever since foyer was passed the freedom of information act
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4380.9s	4380.9	 The government can avoid accountability and prying eyes by simply labeling any document as classified
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4387.6s	4387.6	 So over classification was a logical response
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4390.6s	4390.6	 By the permanent government to the freedom of information act and now has gotten to the point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4396.1s	4396.1	 Where just about everything handed to a president or vice president is classified
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4400.8s	4400.8	 So I think I can understand why they're all making this mistake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4405.3s	4405.3	 And I think a compounding problem is that we never declassify anything. There's still all these records
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4410.0s	4410.0	 From the kennedy assassination. Well, that's that i've never been declassified. They they and they're supposed to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4416.5s	4416.5	 declassified these the cia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4418.8s	4418.8	 Keeps filibustering on the release of the jfk assassination documents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4424.5s	4424.5	 And they've been told they have to stop and they have to release them and then they keep redacting stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4430.8s	4430.8	 Which is making it. I mean, I hate to be a conspiracy theorist here, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4435.5s	4435.5	 What are they trying to cover up? I mean, this is a long time ago. That's the only way to interpret it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4440.8s	4440.8	 But even for more mundane documents, there are very few documents that need to be classified after even say five years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4447.2s	4447.2	 You could argue that we should be automatically declassifying them after five years unless they go through a process to get reclassified
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4454.1s	4454.1	 I mean i'd say like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4456.1s	4456.1	 Just you guys in business. I know it's not government in business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4459.3s	4459.3	 How many of the documents that you deal with are still sensitive are trade secrets five years later?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4466.4s	4466.4	 Certainly 20 years certainly 20 years later. They're not right like in almost all cases like five years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4471.3s	4471.3	 I mean the only documents the only documents in business that I think I deal with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4476.9s	4476.9	 That you could call sensitive are the ones that pertain to the company's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4481.3s	4481.3	 Future plans right because you wouldn't want a cat table to get those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4485.5s	4485.5	 There's a handful of things legal issues. Yeah, even cat table is not that sensitive because by the time you go public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4491.1s	4491.1	 It's legally has to be public. Yeah, it's on card. Like there's a hundred people who have that. I mean, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4496.8s	4496.8	 So like in business, I think our experience has been there's very few documents that stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4502.4s	4502.4	 Sensitive that need to remain secret
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4504.7s	4504.7	 Now look if biden or trump whoever they're reviewing the schematics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4509.8s	4509.8	 To the javelin missile system or to you know, how we make our nuclear bombs or something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4515.3s	4515.3	 Obviously that needs to stay secret forever, but I don't believe our politicians are reviewing those kinds of documents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4521.3s	4521.3	 Well, I mean we both I don't really understand what it is that they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4525.6s	4525.6	 Reviewing why are they keeping them needs to be classified five years later?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4528.9s	4528.9	 Why are they keeping them was the issue we discussed previously. We actually agreed on that. I think they're just keeping mementos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4534.1s	4534.1	 I think there's a simple explanation for why they're keeping them jason, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4537.9s	4537.9	 that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4538.9s	4538.9	 The that everything is more classified and there's a zillion documents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4543.8s	4543.8	 And if you look like both biden and trump these documents were mixed in with a bunch of personal effects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4550.4s	4550.4	 And mementos my point is if you work in government and handle documents, they're all classified
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4557.2s	4557.2	 So if the national archive asks for them back or you find them you should just give them back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4562.1s	4562.1	 I mean that is that's going to wind up being the rug here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4564.9s	4564.9	 Trump didn't give them back and biden did so that's the only difference here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4569.0s	4569.0	 Well, no, no, no, hold on the fbi went to trump's basement. They looked around they said put a lock on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4573.2s	4573.2	 They seemed to be okay with it initially then maybe they changed their minds. I don't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4577.0s	4577.0	 I'm not defending trump. It's pretty clear that he wouldn't give them back. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4579.7s	4579.7	 That was the point i'm making is that now that biden trump and hillary clinton have all been ensnared in this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4586.3s	4586.3	 Is it time to rethink?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4588.3s	4588.3	 The fact that we're over classifying so many documents, I mean just think about the incentives that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4594.4s	4594.4	 That we're creating for our politicians. Okay, just think about the incentives number one never use email
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4600.0s	4600.0	 Remember hillary clinton and the whole email server. Yeah, you gotta be nuts to use email number two never touch a document
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4606.5s	4606.5	 Never touch a document. Why never let anyone hand you a document flush them down the toilet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4612.4s	4612.4	 Never let anyone hand you a document
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4614.4s	4614.4	 Like if you're a politician an elected official
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4618.5s	4618.5	 Yeah, the only time you should ever be handling anything is go into a clean room, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4623.1s	4623.1	 You know make an appointment go in there read something don't take notes. Don't bring a camera and then leave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4628.8s	4628.8	 I mean, this is no way to run a government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4631.4s	4631.4	 It's crazy. Who does this benefit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4634.1s	4634.1	 Who does this benefit? It doesn't benefit our elected officials. It makes it almost impossible for them to act like normal people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4640.9s	4640.9	 That's why it benefits the insiders the permanent government you're missing the most important part about the sex
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4646.9s	4646.9	 This was if you want to go into conspiracy theories
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4649.9s	4649.9	 This was a setup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4651.3s	4651.3	 Biden planted the documents here so that we could create the false equivalency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4656.1s	4656.1	 And start up biden versus trump 2024. This ensures that now trump has something to fight with biden about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4663.3s	4663.3	 And this is going to help trump because they're because they're both tainted equally tainted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4668.1s	4668.1	 Yes, the same source they are they are equally tainted now, but it puts trump in the new cycle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4672.8s	4672.8	 No, I think but I think it's the opposite. I think mary garland now is going to have to drop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4677.7s	4677.7	 The prosecution against trump for the stolen documents or at least that part of what they're investigating him for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4684.0s	4684.0	 They might still investigate him over january 6 or something. They can't investigate trump over documents now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4688.7s	4688.7	 Those two seem more sticky. Yeah, I agree with that. Actually, I think it's going to be hard to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4692.4s	4692.4	 But my point is like just think about look both sides are engaged in hyperparsonship the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4697.6s	4697.6	 Right now the that the conservatives on the right they're attacking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4701.9s	4701.9	 Biden now for the same thing that the left was attacking trump for my point is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4706.5s	4706.5	 Like just take a step back and again think about the incentives we're creating about how to run our government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4711.8s	4711.8	 You can't use email and you can't touch documents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4715.7s	4715.7	 And everything's an investigation the second you get in office
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4718.7s	4718.7	 And by the way, if you're don't ever go into politics if you're a business person because it'll investigate every deal you ever did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4725.9s	4725.9	 Prior prior to getting into politics. I mean just think about the incentives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4729.4s	4729.4	 What are you going to do when you try to get your your treasury position? What's going to be nuts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4733.7s	4733.7	 You got to be nuts to go in a government. So you're not going to take a position in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4736.9s	4736.9	 DeSantis' cabinet. My point is that that the that the washington insiders by which I mean the permanent washington establishment i.e.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4742.6s	4742.6	 The deep state they're creating a system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4745.6s	4745.6	 In which they're running things and the elected officials barely can operate like normal functioning humans there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4752.3s	4752.3	 Hmm interesting I heard I heard a great rumor. This is total gossip mongering. Oh, here we go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4761.4s	4761.4	 That you know one of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4763.7s	4763.7	 Ken griffin's best out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4765.9s	4765.9	 Is to get deSantis elected so that he can become treasury secretary. I mean ken griffin would get that if he wanted it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4773.5s	4773.5	 And then he would be able to divest all of citadel tax-free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4777.7s	4777.7	 so he would mark the market like 30 billion dollars, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4781.6s	4781.6	 A genius way to go out now, then it occurred to me. Oh my god. That is me and sax's path, too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4788.7s	4788.7	 With a lot less money, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4792.6s	4792.6	 Wait, why would it be tax-free?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4794.9s	4794.9	 When you get appointed to those branch those senior posts you're allowed to either stick it in a blind trust
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4801.3s	4801.3	 Or you can sell with no capital gains
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4803.7s	4803.7	 What?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4804.7s	4804.7	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4806.3s	4806.3	 What well because they want you they want you to divest anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4810.8s	4810.8	 Yes, anything that presents a conflict they want you to divest and so the argument is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4814.8s	4814.8	 If you have if you're forced to divest it to enter a government, you shouldn't be forcibly taxed on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4819.7s	4819.7	 Mayor of san francisco or austin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4823.7s	4823.7	 Secretary of transportation jacob you can do that. Oh i'm qualified for that. That's right. I take the bus. I got an electric bike
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4830.4s	4830.4	 To answer freebrook's point. I think citadel securities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4833.3s	4833.3	 There's a lot of folks that would buy that because that's just the securities trading business and then citadel the hedge fund
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4838.6s	4838.6	 Probably something like a big bulge bracket bank or blackstone probably blackstone in fact because now blackstone can plug it into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4845.4s	4845.4	 A trillion dollar asset machine. It's a I think there would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=11&t=4849.0s	4849.0	 Buyers out the door. This is this is an incredible grift. Now. I know why sax it's not a grift at all
