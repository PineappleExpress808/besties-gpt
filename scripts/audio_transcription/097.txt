https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=0.0s	0.0	 I'm in a very Daniel Plainview mood this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2.7s	2.7	 There will be blood scene behind me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4.6s	4.6	 I have a competition in me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=5.4s	5.4	 I don't want to see other people succeed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=7.3s	7.3	 That's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=8.2s	8.2	 Best scene ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=9.0s	9.0	 You are the furthest from that character.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=12.2s	12.2	 Like that is not your spirit animal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=13.7s	13.7	 Oh, there will be blood?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=14.6s	14.6	 That guy, Daniel Day-Lewis?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=15.9s	15.9	 He has nothing to do with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=17.7s	17.7	 I've watched it about a hundred times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=19.0s	19.0	 Incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=19.8s	19.8	 You must be so stormy and roiled on the inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=24.5s	24.5	 Oh my gosh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=26.0s	26.0	 Did you not see my roast at Saks's birthday?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=28.2s	28.2	 It's just a roast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=29.1s	29.1	 Did I not see it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=29.9s	29.9	 I lived it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=30.8s	30.8	 It was the most off-color, disgusting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=33.3s	33.3	 egregious, mean diatribe I've ever heard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=37.3s	37.3	 My Lord.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=38.2s	38.2	 I have a competition in me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=39.8s	39.8	 I don't like to see others succeed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=41.6s	41.6	 I can't stand that J. Cal is a good moderator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=44.0s	44.0	 I guess everybody wants to know Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=65.3s	65.3	 You've wound down two Spaks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=68.5s	68.5	 Thank you for doing this for IPOF specifically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=71.3s	71.3	 because people are replying to me every day asking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=74.4s	74.4	 what are you going to Spak?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=76.7s	76.7	 But IPO, D and F, the money has been returned to investors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=80.4s	80.4	 No, it's going to be returned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=82.8s	82.8	 Going to be returned to investors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=83.9s	83.9	 Thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=84.8s	84.8	 And Bill Ackman, of course, he wound down his Spak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=87.1s	87.1	 returning four billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=88.0s	88.0	 There's over 500 Spaks out there looking for deals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=91.8s	91.8	 Tell us why this decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=94.9s	94.9	 Well, I've raised 10 Spaks, six in technology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=98.0s	98.0	 and four in biotechnology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=99.6s	99.6	 And I've done six deals, two in tech and two in biotech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=104.6s	104.6	 Four in tech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=105.9s	105.9	 Sorry, four in tech, four in tech, thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=107.5s	107.5	 And two in biotech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=109.3s	109.3	 So the reason to shut it down is pretty straightforward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=112.3s	112.3	 It's like, when we launched these things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=115.0s	115.0	 the stock market was in a much different place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=117.8s	117.8	 than it is today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=119.0s	119.0	 And so over the last two years at looking at deals,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=122.5s	122.5	 it's gotten harder and harder to find a good risk reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=126.7s	126.7	 Now, why is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=127.5s	127.5	 Well, the thing with the Spak is you do a deal today,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=131.2s	131.2	 but it doesn't usually close for six or seven months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=133.7s	133.7	 in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=135.2s	135.2	 And so you have to do a deal where you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=138.6s	138.6	 a really good sense that in six or seven months,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=141.0s	141.0	 when the deal comes to close,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=144.0s	144.0	 that the price will be the same or even higher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=147.3s	147.3	 than what it is today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=150.0s	150.0	 And if it isn't, all of the investors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=152.7s	152.7	 that you've brought along in the Spak have a right to redeem,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=156.5s	156.5	 which is to say they file a notice that says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=158.4s	158.4	 you can complete the deal, but I want my money back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=161.5s	161.5	 And what they get back is the initial $10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=163.7s	163.7	 that they used to buy the stock in the first place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=165.6s	165.6	 Because when we started the Spak, we sold stock at $10.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=170.6s	170.6	 And so from my perspective, I was looking at this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=172.6s	172.6	 and I'm like, you know, this is a super volatile,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=175.8s	175.8	 ugly point in the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=177.0s	177.0	 This last year has been really problematic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=179.0s	179.0	 And I kind of said this last November,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=182.1s	182.1	 and Nick, we can play the clip after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=183.8s	183.8	 and we can come back to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=185.3s	185.3	 But basically my decision was that at this point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=189.0s	189.0	 to do a deal would probably put a lot of capital at risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=194.0s	194.0	 And in all of these deals, I'm typically investing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=197.1s	197.1	 $100 million at least in each of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=199.8s	199.8	 And so I couldn't justify that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=201.2s	201.2	 I couldn't see a good risk reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=202.7s	202.7	 And I thought the right thing to do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=204.2s	204.2	 the responsible thing to do was just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=205.8s	205.8	 to wind these things down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=207.4s	207.4	 I'll lose, I don't know, 10, 15, 20 million bucks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=210.4s	210.4	 for having set these things up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=212.4s	212.4	 But we give everybody their money back, that $10.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=214.9s	214.9	 And I think that's actually better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=216.4s	216.4	 over the next five or six months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=218.3s	218.3	 than what it'll otherwise do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=219.6s	219.6	 if you're invested in the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=220.7s	220.7	 Now that's a belief that I have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=223.5s	223.5	 But hopefully when people get the $10 back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=225.2s	225.2	 in the next few weeks, if they want,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=226.4s	226.4	 they can go and put that money back in the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=229.6s	229.6	 And hopefully they'll do well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=230.5s	230.5	 But you know, from my perspective,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=232.0s	232.0	 the risk reward was not good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=233.7s	233.7	 Is part of the issue, the inventory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=235.5s	235.5	 that's available of great companies as well?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=238.6s	238.6	 That's one of the things I heard speculated on CNBC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=240.8s	240.8	 It's hard to convince a private company to go public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=243.0s	243.0	 Here's my experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=244.2s	244.2	 When I was talking to all of these CEOs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=247.1s	247.1	 of these Silicon Valley companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=249.3s	249.3	 initially there was a lot of misunderstanding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=251.8s	251.8	 about what SPACs were.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=253.2s	253.2	 And I think we were able to dispel that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=254.9s	254.9	 because we had some really successful transactions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=258.1s	258.1	 Then there was a lot of interest in being a part of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=261.4s	261.4	 In this phase, we were suffering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=263.0s	263.0	 from two very important things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=264.9s	264.9	 One was that valuations were just completely up in the air.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=268.6s	268.6	 People had a huge question mark on late stage valuations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=271.5s	271.5	 because we would come in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=273.3s	273.3	 we would do the work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=274.2s	274.2	 and we would say the company's worth X.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=276.7s	276.7	 And that number typically was 50 or 60% lower
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=280.6s	280.6	 than their last private valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=283.1s	283.1	 And so when it came time for us to negotiate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=286.0s	286.0	 doing the deal, even if the founder was roughly on board,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=290.4s	290.4	 the rest of the board was not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=292.2s	292.2	 Because a lot of them would have seen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=293.9s	293.9	 some pretty meaningful markdowns in their private assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=298.8s	298.8	 And when the company had enough money to kind of like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=302.1s	302.1	 at least stay private for another year or so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=304.5s	304.5	 without having to raise money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=306.7s	306.7	 on balance, those investors felt it was more prudent for them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=310.9s	310.9	 to not take the mark and to not take the deal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=314.0s	314.0	 at such a lower discount.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=316.2s	316.2	 So that was a big issue that we ran into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=318.0s	318.0	 because every time we would price a deal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=319.9s	319.9	 again, we're trying to create a margin of safety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=322.3s	322.3	 for us and our investors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=324.1s	324.1	 again, because it's gonna take six to nine months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=326.0s	326.0	 to close a deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=326.9s	326.9	 And so ideally you want this thing-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=327.7s	327.7	 So a lot of valuation indigestion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=329.8s	329.8	 And then, sorry, the second thing was just volatility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=331.7s	331.7	 So when you see volatility in the public markets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=335.4s	335.4	 you know, for a CEO, and I can understand this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=339.3s	339.3	 it's much easier to go public in a point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=341.6s	341.6	 where the markets are generally going in one direction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=344.1s	344.1	 because it gives them the confidence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=346.7s	346.7	 to be able to learn the ropes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=347.9s	347.9	 because it is a complicated process being public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=350.7s	350.7	 And when you introduce tremendous market-based volatility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=353.8s	353.8	 independent of your company,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=355.7s	355.7	 I think a lot of CEOs and CFOs and IR people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=359.7s	359.7	 were a little nervous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=362.2s	362.2	 And that was the second piece,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=364.2s	364.2	 but by in a way, the first one was valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=366.5s	366.5	 We could not find market clearing prices-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=369.8s	369.8	 Makes sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=370.7s	370.7	 For assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=371.6s	371.6	 And by the way, and I'll talk about one company in specific
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=373.7s	373.7	 which just this week had a pretty public blow up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=375.8s	375.8	 around this whole issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=376.8s	376.8	 And look, I've been pretty clear about this since November.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=379.5s	379.5	 The marginal trade should have been to be trimming risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=382.6s	382.6	 And Nick, maybe you can play the clip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=384.2s	384.2	 because I really wanna make sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=385.2s	385.2	 that it's very clear and on the record what I said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=388.1s	388.1	 almost an entire year ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=390.3s	390.3	 Let me put crypto in the context of the markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=392.7s	392.7	 and where we are today at the end of the week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=395.3s	395.3	 after Q3 earnings in November of 2021.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=399.4s	399.4	 We have the stock market at absolute all-time highs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=404.0s	404.0	 Ripping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=404.9s	404.9	 We have crypto at absolute all-time highs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=408.1s	408.1	 Ripping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=408.9s	408.9	 We have the art markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=409.7s	409.7	 I don't know if you guys saw Phillips and Christie's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=411.4s	411.4	 and Sotheby's this past week at absolute all-time highs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=414.9s	414.9	 Sold another people for 25 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=417.0s	417.0	 We have inflation at a 30 year high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=420.0s	420.0	 We have 10 year break evens at a 25 year high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=424.2s	424.2	 We have, you know, one point somewhat trillion dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=427.2s	427.2	 that we just approved last weekend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=428.5s	428.5	 We're still horse trading on another three,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=431.1s	431.1	 you know, $1.8 trillion of stimulus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=433.4s	433.4	 that we're going to put in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=434.4s	434.4	 And I think the most important thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=436.6s	436.6	 which is the two most important founders of our generation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=440.7s	440.7	 the two smartest people who have really consistently won,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=443.9s	443.9	 Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=445.1s	445.1	 have collectively sold more than $11 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=447.4s	447.4	 of their holdings this year alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=450.3s	450.3	 And if you can't take all of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=452.6s	452.6	 and decide for yourself what's right for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=454.7s	454.7	 and your family, you're doing yourself a disservice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=457.5s	457.5	 I think it's important for me to never sort of like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=460.1s	460.1	 you know, be forced to tell folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=462.0s	462.0	 whether I'm buying or selling,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=463.2s	463.2	 although I'm willing to do it in moments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=464.8s	464.8	 where I think it's important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=467.4s	467.4	 But I think it's really important to understand the context.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=470.3s	470.3	 And so I think like these folks that like think derisively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=473.5s	473.5	 about individuals who are managing risk,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=475.8s	475.8	 I think it's really naive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=477.3s	477.3	 And I think it creates a lot of missed opportunity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=480.2s	480.2	 for them as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=481.1s	481.1	 If the smartest people in the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=484.3s	484.3	 are now selling their core holdings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=486.7s	486.7	 that they told you they would never sell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=489.4s	489.4	 and you are not reconsidering your position on things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=494.8s	494.8	 you're either much smarter than them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=497.9s	497.9	 or you're being really, really reckless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=500.8s	500.8	 The reason I said all of those things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=503.9s	503.9	 was because I was getting really worried
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=506.0s	506.0	 about where we were.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=507.7s	507.7	 And then I think on the heels of that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=510.1s	510.1	 I published a tweet and I said, I'm starting to sell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=514.9s	514.9	 You know, and I sold like $100 million of SoFi,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=517.2s	517.2	 but then I was a systematic seller
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=519.9s	519.9	 through the end of last year and through this year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=523.3s	523.3	 to try to manage my own liquidity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=524.8s	524.8	 because it changed profoundly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=526.2s	526.2	 as I saw what was happening in the markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=528.7s	528.7	 So, you know, I think that it's just an important thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=531.8s	531.8	 to call out that things don't always go up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=536.3s	536.3	 and you have to pay attention to a mosaic of information
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=540.3s	540.3	 and you have to do the work yourself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=542.5s	542.5	 because, you know, your situation is unique to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=545.2s	545.2	 Nobody else understands it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=547.0s	547.0	 And so you can't outsource that decision to somebody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=550.5s	550.5	 Obviously you can use it as a guide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=552.4s	552.4	 You know, it's fair to say, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=553.5s	553.5	 when the 13 Fs of important hedge funds come out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=556.3s	556.3	 do I read them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=557.1s	557.1	 Of course, because I'm trying to figure out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=559.2s	559.2	 you know, what don't I know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=560.4s	560.4	 What may I be missing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=561.5s	561.5	 Maybe there's a great company in there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=562.9s	562.9	 that I should be taking a look at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=564.8s	564.8	 So, you know, I'm not dissimilar to everybody else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=567.3s	567.3	 in that I use other people that I look up to or respect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=570.4s	570.4	 as a leading indicator of what to buy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=573.3s	573.3	 but I still take responsibility for my own decisions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=575.7s	575.7	 and I manage my liquidity as best as I can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=577.9s	577.9	 based on my conditions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=579.7s	579.7	 And those are always changing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=581.9s	581.9	 And so I think this is just a good reminder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=583.6s	583.6	 that everybody else has to do the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=585.4s	585.4	 So Chamath, what do you think happens to the remaining 500?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=587.6s	587.6	 Every SPAC sponsor friend of mine that I know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=590.6s	590.6	 is not seeking targets anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=593.1s	593.1	 They're all expecting to wind up and return capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=596.1s	596.1	 How many of the 500 do you think will actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=597.8s	597.8	 find a target and how many do you think of remaining SPACs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=600.9s	600.9	 How many of them will wind up and return capital?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=604.5s	604.5	 I mean, I think that there's still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=606.0s	606.0	 some really good deals to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=608.9s	608.9	 They're not necessarily in tech per se.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=611.7s	611.7	 So, you know, I think you did a really great deal in ag tech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=614.3s	614.3	 I think that that's really interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=615.8s	615.8	 So time will tell how that does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=617.6s	617.6	 I think there's some really interesting deals in energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=620.0s	620.0	 In fact, we spent a lot of time actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=622.1s	622.1	 pivoting and spending time and energy looking at everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=625.3s	625.3	 from producers of Natgas and oil to folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=630.0s	630.0	 that were building terminals to LNG facilities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=634.0s	634.0	 But it's just a very different return profile
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=635.8s	635.8	 than what we were used to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=637.6s	637.6	 So I think if you can understand some of these other markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=642.0s	642.0	 and you can underwrite to a different rate of return,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=646.0s	646.0	 some decent deals will get done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=647.9s	647.9	 The overwhelming majority of the tech SPACs, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=650.3s	650.3	 probably will just wind up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=653.0s	653.0	 Some folks will be really focused
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=655.4s	655.4	 on trying to monetize their founder promote.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=661.0s	661.0	 So they'll do any kind of deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=663.9s	663.9	 The problem, as you see, is even whether you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=665.7s	665.7	 do a good deal or bad deal, with the kind of volatility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=668.4s	668.4	 we're seeing in the market, the likelihood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=670.2s	670.2	 is that it's going to trade down pretty significantly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=672.4s	672.4	 So I think most will not find a home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=675.3s	675.3	 I think some will find some really interesting targets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=677.8s	677.8	 in areas like energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=679.1s	679.1	 I think are really interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=680.9s	680.9	 Agriculture, like what you did, Freeberg,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=682.6s	682.6	 I think is a really interesting deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=685.2s	685.2	 And then, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=686.5s	686.5	 It'll be an opportunity for us to retool the SPAC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=690.1s	690.1	 I don't think it's going to go away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=692.2s	692.2	 I think that it is a useful tool in a toolbox of many tools.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=696.2s	696.2	 So there's IPOs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=698.2s	698.2	 There's direct listings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=700.9s	700.9	 There are SPACs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=703.3s	703.3	 There's obviously private fundraising.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=705.8s	705.8	 There's convertible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=706.7s	706.7	 There's structured deals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=708.0s	708.0	 So it is a tool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=709.3s	709.3	 And I think when used properly, it can be really helpful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=712.1s	712.1	 For the companies that we worked with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=714.5s	714.5	 it would have been impossible for them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=716.2s	716.2	 to raise the quantums of capital that they did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=718.0s	718.0	 Primary capital from sophisticated hedge funds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=720.3s	720.3	 and mutual funds, we raised billions and billions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=723.0s	723.0	 of dollars for companies like SoFi and Opendoor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=725.7s	725.7	 And I think that that's going to go a long way for them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=727.8s	727.8	 to achieve their goals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=729.1s	729.1	 So I think it's going to be a good tool,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=731.4s	731.4	 but we're going to go through a washout of most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=733.9s	733.9	 of these folks who are not going to be able to successfully
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=736.2s	736.2	 find targets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=737.4s	737.4	 So when we look at private companies, especially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=739.2s	739.2	 the late stage ones, you and I are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=740.7s	740.7	 involved in a number of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=743.1s	743.1	 They're doing rifts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=744.0s	744.0	 They've got headwinds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=744.9s	744.9	 And their valuations are underwater in many cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=748.2s	748.2	 How are they thinking about the public market windows,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=751.3s	751.3	 SPACs, direct listings, or just a traditional IPO?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=754.7s	754.7	 I don't know if they are thinking about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=757.0s	757.0	 I think going public seems like a fantasy at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=760.1s	760.1	 I think the whole public markets exit idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=763.4s	763.4	 has frozen for two years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=765.1s	765.1	 Two years?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=766.2s	766.2	 Yeah, I think that's probably what people are thinking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=768.6s	768.6	 What are these late stage companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=770.0s	770.0	 that raised mega rounds doing to work out valuation issues?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=774.3s	774.3	 Because as Chamath just pointed out, with SPACs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=777.1s	777.1	 one of the problems was clearing market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=779.4s	779.4	 The late stage investors who came in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=781.2s	781.2	 maybe they don't want to accept the haircut and valuation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=784.3s	784.3	 even if they have productive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=786.1s	786.1	 Probably not enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=787.3s	787.3	 I mean, what they're doing is using their war chest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=790.4s	790.4	 to grow into their valuations, which is the smart strategy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=794.7s	794.7	 And if they're really smart, they'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=796.2s	796.2	 be slashing their burn while they do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=799.3s	799.3	 But yeah, it's no different than we've talked about before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=802.3s	802.3	 I think that the main significance of this past week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=805.2s	805.2	 is that you had the Fed meeting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=807.7s	807.7	 It raised another 75 basis points.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=809.6s	809.6	 There's no surprise to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=810.9s	810.9	 That was predicted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=811.7s	811.7	 What was new was the forecast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=814.0s	814.0	 They're now saying that they expect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=815.7s	815.7	 to raise another 1 and 1.5%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=818.0s	818.0	 Just two months ago at the last meeting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=820.0s	820.0	 they were saying 75 at this meeting plus 50 after that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=823.7s	823.7	 Now they're saying 150 after this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=827.0s	827.0	 So in just two months, they've now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=831.2s	831.2	 revised their forecast for an extra 100 basis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=833.9s	833.9	 points of rate increases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=835.9s	835.9	 Why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=836.4s	836.4	 Because inflation is worse than they thought.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=838.2s	838.2	 So things are worse than we thought two months ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=842.1s	842.1	 The last inflation print didn't get better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=845.1s	845.1	 as fast as people wanted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=846.2s	846.2	 We talked about that last week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=847.7s	847.7	 Now the Fed is revising its forecast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=849.6s	849.6	 The trajectory is bad and getting worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=853.0s	853.0	 And you finally had Powell throw in the towel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=856.8s	856.8	 on his rhetoric around soft landing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=859.2s	859.2	 First it was, well, we can raise rates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=862.5s	862.5	 and we won't have a recession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=863.8s	863.8	 Then it was we might have a mild recession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=866.4s	866.4	 Now he's basically saying hard landing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=868.8s	868.8	 if you read these FOMC comments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=872.7s	872.7	 So I think this was a really bad week for the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=876.3s	876.3	 And you're seeing it in the markets this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=878.4s	878.4	 We are retracing almost within 5% of the June lows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=883.1s	883.1	 with the growth stocks being the ones that are hardest hit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=886.0s	886.0	 By the way, speaking of growth stocks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=887.5s	887.5	 have you guys been following this trials and tribulations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=891.0s	891.0	 with ByJu's, which is one of the largest valued private companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=895.2s	895.2	 but it's a private Indian EdTech company?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=899.5s	899.5	 Essentially, I think there was this delayed audit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=903.1s	903.1	 and Deloitte couldn't certify a bunch of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=905.1s	905.1	 And then finally they were able to come up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=906.4s	906.4	 with a report that essentially showed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=908.0s	908.0	 that instead of breaking even or making money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=910.3s	910.3	 they lost almost $600 million this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=913.1s	913.1	 And that a lot of the revenue that they were booking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=916.0s	916.0	 were actually loans to millions of Indian families
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=920.8s	920.8	 who had basically zero probability of paying them back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=923.9s	923.9	 So a lot of the revenue was not real as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=927.5s	927.5	 And this is like a who's who of investors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=929.3s	929.3	 It's everybody from Sequoia, Tiger, UBS, BlackRock,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=934.9s	934.9	 Chan Zuckerberg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=936.0s	936.0	 It's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=937.1s	937.1	 I think when the tide goes out, we find out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=939.1s	939.1	 And this is what's happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=940.1s	940.1	 The tide's out, and you're going to find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=941.9s	941.9	 all the weakness in the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=943.1s	943.1	 It's all going to get flushed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=944.5s	944.5	 I think this is a bit of an outlier, obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=946.5s	946.5	 I don't think that all these companies that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=949.0s	949.0	 are worth tens of billions of dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=951.5s	951.5	 are running so close to the sun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=953.2s	953.2	 But it just goes to show you that how does this happen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=961.0s	961.0	 How do you not get a data?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=962.2s	962.2	 We saw this on the seed stage in series A. We
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=965.3s	965.3	 would ask for a data room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=966.5s	966.5	 The person would say, you're the only investor asking for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=969.0s	969.0	 And you're putting in 10% of the round.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=971.3s	971.3	 These other people aren't even asking for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=973.3s	973.3	 We said, OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=974.1s	974.1	 Can we still see the data room?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=975.5s	975.5	 And it turned out there wasn't one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=976.9s	976.9	 People were just making bets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=978.3s	978.3	 They were making blind bets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=979.5s	979.5	 They were betting without even looking at their cards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=981.7s	981.7	 You're thinking about the other people's cards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=984.1s	984.1	 This goes back to what Friedberg was saying before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=987.3s	987.3	 I think there's a sliver of the retail investor base that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=992.1s	992.1	 is not dissimilar to a sliver of the private equity and hedge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=995.1s	995.1	 fund and venture capital space, which is these folks are not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=997.9s	997.9	 willing to do the work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=999.3s	999.3	 I think most people are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1000.9s	1000.9	 And most people want to come to their own conclusions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1003.1s	1003.1	 But some people want to just take the easy momentum driven
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1005.6s	1005.6	 decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1006.6s	1006.6	 And they typically always get punished.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1008.9s	1008.9	 Over time, there is this concept of adverse selection,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1012.5s	1012.5	 which is that the negative actors will find them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1015.5s	1015.5	 will seek them out, and it will be a match.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1017.8s	1017.8	 And so they'll ultimately get adversely selected
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1020.3s	1020.3	 into the deals that blow them up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1022.7s	1022.7	 So the bad deals, what you're saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1024.5s	1024.5	 is the bad deals would find the bad investors who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1026.7s	1026.7	 don't do the work, and then they spiral and crash together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1030.0s	1030.0	 That's a really brilliant observation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1032.1s	1032.1	 Yeah, I think the other thing is you have this situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1036.0s	1036.0	 where if it wasn't that, it's folks outsourcing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1039.5s	1039.5	 their diligence to the person that did the round before it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1041.8s	1041.8	 Totally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1042.9s	1042.9	 Oh, Silver Lake did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1044.4s	1044.4	 Same problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1045.1s	1045.1	 Tiger did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1046.2s	1046.2	 OK, these guys are very sophisticated investors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1048.8s	1048.8	 I don't need to do the work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1050.8s	1050.8	 And it turned out you did, because it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1053.5s	1053.5	 was a very cavalier way of recognizing revenue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1060.0s	1060.0	 There was a specific playbook here, too,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1061.8s	1061.8	 that I don't know if you saw this, X, in the early stage,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1064.3s	1064.3	 where people would get their friends to invest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1066.6s	1066.6	 in the company or some high net worth individuals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1069.8s	1069.8	 And then you'd look at the deal, and the valuation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1072.1s	1072.1	 didn't make sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1073.4s	1073.4	 And then you say, well, we would always ask,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1075.3s	1075.3	 how much money is each person putting in?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1076.9s	1076.9	 And we're like, well, their normal bet size in the seed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1079.3s	1079.3	 is 750 or 1.5 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1082.1s	1082.1	 But they're putting 50k into this or 100k.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1084.0s	1084.0	 What's going on here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1084.8s	1084.8	 And it was, oh, they're friends with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1086.6s	1086.6	 They worked at a previous company together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1089.0s	1089.0	 They went to the same college, and so people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1090.8s	1090.8	 were using social proof, but manipulating it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1094.4s	1094.4	 to get some other sucker at the table to pay full price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1096.9s	1096.9	 and not do diligence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1098.5s	1098.5	 Really strange behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1100.8s	1100.8	 I was in Singapore this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1104.1s	1104.1	 I had this great meeting with this young investor,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1107.0s	1107.0	 really dynamic guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1108.0s	1108.0	 And he was telling me about a company in Indonesia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1112.0s	1112.0	 that he didn't invest in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1113.3s	1113.3	 But it turned out that this founder was literally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1117.2s	1117.2	 running two parallel sets of accounting systems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1120.5s	1120.5	 And so he was showing a business and fundraising from this set.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1125.4s	1125.4	 But the real books were over here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1127.7s	1127.7	 and it looked a completely different system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1129.5s	1129.5	 And it was basically like a Ponzi scheme.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1131.6s	1131.6	 And he was telling me, it's impossible to root these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1134.7s	1134.7	 out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1135.2s	1135.2	 So what he said he relies on is, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1137.9s	1137.9	 have to have a network when you're doing these frontier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1141.4s	1141.4	 country deals where he says, I need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1144.2s	1144.2	 to find at least 10 people that know this person so that there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1147.7s	1147.7	 is a moral social proof and moral diligence that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1151.5s	1151.5	 happens, because that person will never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1153.4s	1153.4	 try to commit something that egregious in the face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1155.9s	1155.9	 of all of their friends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1158.0s	1158.0	 And so that's a mechanism of filtering this stuff out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1160.7s	1160.7	 But I thought that was a really interesting way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1162.7s	1162.7	 of designing a diligence process, at least
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1165.2s	1165.2	 in a frontier market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1166.1s	1166.1	 Here, I don't think you have that much time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1168.5s	1168.5	 to do these really fast paced deals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1172.0s	1172.0	 And the social proof matters less,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1173.9s	1173.9	 because you theoretically are looking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1176.9s	1176.9	 for signals of traction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1179.5s	1179.5	 But there has to be a better systematic way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1181.3s	1181.3	 of getting this diligence done, because these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1183.4s	1183.4	 should be pretty obvious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1184.5s	1184.5	 Sachs, did you have?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1185.9s	1185.9	 Well before it's a multi-deck a billion dollar company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1188.2s	1188.2	 Sachs, last year when people were moving really fast,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1190.3s	1190.3	 saying they don't have time for diligence,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1191.7s	1191.7	 you're going to lose the deal, yada, yada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1193.1s	1193.1	 How did you approach diligence during those peak periods?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1195.5s	1195.5	 And did you have those experiences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1196.9s	1196.9	 where people were trying to push you to close
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1199.6s	1199.6	 without talking to customers or looking at bank statements,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1202.7s	1202.7	 yada, yada?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1203.1s	1203.1	 No, we wouldn't play that game, because we always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1205.2s	1205.2	 run SaaS metrics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1206.1s	1206.1	 That's always the starting point for us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1208.2s	1208.2	 But most SaaS companies, they have SaaS metrics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1212.0s	1212.0	 I mean, it's so standardized that it would be such a red flag
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1215.0s	1215.0	 if they didn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1215.9s	1215.9	 I think it might be companies that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1218.8s	1218.8	 have unusual business models, where maybe they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1221.1s	1221.1	 would say something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1222.3s	1222.3	 But no, we can never do a SaaS investment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1225.0s	1225.0	 without SaaS metrics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1226.2s	1226.2	 All right, well, this is a good segue, because right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1228.5s	1228.5	 US venture capitalists are sitting on $290 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1232.1s	1232.1	 in dry powder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1232.8s	1232.8	 We had talked about this last year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1234.2s	1234.2	 how much dry powder was there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1235.7s	1235.7	 The market has obviously collapsed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1237.5s	1237.5	 But here's a chart from our friends over at PitchBook.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1241.8s	1241.8	 Just extraordinary how much has built up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1243.9s	1243.9	 and how much has been raised.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1245.1s	1245.1	 US VC funds raised $121 billion during the first half of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1250.7s	1250.7	 year, 2022.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1252.4s	1252.4	 So LPs still have an appetite, which kind of makes sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1255.6s	1255.6	 that investing into the down market for private companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1258.5s	1258.5	 means you're going to get better deals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1260.1s	1260.1	 And you have a 10-year horizon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1261.8s	1261.8	 US VCs raised $139 billion in all of 2021.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1265.1s	1265.1	 So if you put those two numbers together,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1267.7s	1267.7	 yeah, you're looking at $260 billion in the last 18 months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1272.5s	1272.5	 And this is all record numbers being put up on the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1275.9s	1275.9	 What does this say for private companies, Zach?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1279.7s	1279.7	 I dispute this analysis a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1283.0s	1283.0	 I think there's a couple of things going on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1284.9s	1284.9	 that need to be taken into consideration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1286.6s	1286.6	 First of all, new funds don't get announced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1289.3s	1289.3	 till after the process completes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1292.2s	1292.2	 And then it may even be some time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1294.4s	1294.4	 after that when the VC firm feels like they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1296.2s	1296.2	 want to make the announcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1297.4s	1297.4	 You can't announce a fund until the process is completely over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1300.5s	1300.5	 or you get subject to all sorts of additional SEC rules.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1303.4s	1303.4	 So these funds might be announced in 2022.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1308.9s	1308.9	 But they may have actually been raised in 2021.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1311.9s	1311.9	 So that, I think, is a really important point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1314.5s	1314.5	 Moreover, a lot of the funds may have already deployed capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1317.7s	1317.7	 before the crash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1318.6s	1318.6	 So there was that, I think, remarkable story
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1321.7s	1321.7	 that we talked about months ago in TechCrunch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1324.5s	1324.5	 on how the latest Tiger fund, which wasn't even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1327.4s	1327.4	 announced till March or April of 2022,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1330.6s	1330.6	 but it had already been 2 thirds deployed by the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1333.3s	1333.3	 they even announced it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1334.3s	1334.3	 And so that was pretty stunning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1336.9s	1336.9	 So I think that we don't really have a great sense of how much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1342.6s	1342.6	 of this so-called dry powder has already been deployed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1345.1s	1345.1	 how much of it was really raised before the crash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1347.8s	1347.8	 It is true that LP relationships with VC firms that have done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1351.2s	1351.2	 well are sticky and good LPs stick with their partners
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1355.7s	1355.7	 during a downturn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1357.6s	1357.6	 So look, I mean, the VC world's not going out of business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1359.9s	1359.9	 or anything like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1360.7s	1360.7	 But I would tend to think that this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1363.3s	1363.3	 is an overly optimistic, overly rosy scenario.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1367.8s	1367.8	 Do VCs have new funds that they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1370.0s	1370.0	 going to be ready to deploy in great companies?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1372.6s	1372.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1373.1s	1373.1	 But does this mean it's going to be easy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1375.5s	1375.5	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1376.0s	1376.0	 I think that the bar has gone up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1378.7s	1378.7	 Valuations have gone down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1380.2s	1380.2	 Founders looking at this tweet storm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1382.1s	1382.1	 I would not get lulled into a false sense of security.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1385.5s	1385.5	 Yeah, I agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1386.7s	1386.7	 Just to explain that, there's probably a six-month lag
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1389.1s	1389.1	 on when these funds are announced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1390.5s	1390.5	 The reason is there's 506B and C designations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1393.9s	1393.9	 Most people raise under 506B, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1395.6s	1395.6	 means you cannot even say that you're fundraising.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1397.7s	1397.7	 Therefore, PitchBook can never have that data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1400.0s	1400.0	 So there's a lag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1400.8s	1400.8	 And people were deploying at a very high velocity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1404.7s	1404.7	 Therefore, this number could be off 35%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1407.8s	1407.8	 Well, if people were deploying at a pace where they thought
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1410.3s	1410.3	 they were going to go back for a new fund every year, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1412.6s	1412.6	 is what it was looking like in 2020, 2021,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1416.5s	1416.5	 that six-month period might mean you've deployed half the fund.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1419.6s	1419.6	 So but look, if you just go back to a two and a half or three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1425.7s	1425.7	 year pace of deployment, and before in 2021,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1429.5s	1429.5	 we're at a one-year pace of deployment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1431.7s	1431.7	 divide the availability of capital by 2 thirds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1436.3s	1436.3	 Only one third as much will be deployed in any given year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1438.8s	1438.8	 That's a significant reduction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1441.3s	1441.3	 So yeah, I think founders should just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1443.8s	1443.8	 be aware that the market's going to be a lot tighter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1446.3s	1446.3	 And I think given what we're seeing in the public markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1449.2s	1449.2	 it doesn't look to me like it's going to get any better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1451.2s	1451.2	 It looks to me like we're headed for,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1453.0s	1453.0	 I mean, I called it a double dip recession,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1455.5s	1455.5	 I think a couple of months ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1457.0s	1457.0	 That's exactly what it's looking like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1459.0s	1459.0	 In fact, the Fed basically said as much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1460.6s	1460.6	 The Fed said that would be just marginally positive next quarter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1465.5s	1465.5	 So we'd bounce back to slightly positive growth on a real basis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1471.2s	1471.2	 But then expect it to go negative again and recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1475.7s	1475.7	 once all these interest rates kick in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1477.6s	1477.6	 And by the way, I mean, kudos to Chamath for basically calling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1480.5s	1480.5	 that when the Fed just a couple of months ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1483.2s	1483.2	 was saying that so-called neutral would be 3% to 3.5%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1487.4s	1487.4	 Chamath was saying, no, it's going to be 4.5%, 5% plus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1490.5s	1490.5	 Now the Fed just in two months has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1492.0s	1492.0	 revised to saying that neutral is 4.6% or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1497.0s	1497.0	 And they don't think there's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1498.8s	1498.8	 to be any rate reductions in 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1502.3s	1502.3	 So this is not looking good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1503.8s	1503.8	 How much Chamath of the issue here is we don't the data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1509.3s	1509.3	 that we're seeing, the ground truth we're seeing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1511.4s	1511.4	 as you would often say, might be very different than the reports
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1515.4s	1515.4	 that are coming out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1516.2s	1516.2	 People are talking about inflation from 60 days ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1519.3s	1519.3	 job reports that are 30 days old, 60 days old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1521.6s	1521.6	 We don't really have live data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1524.6s	1524.6	 It seems like our government doesn't use live data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1527.4s	1527.4	 when they make these decisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1530.4s	1530.4	 Well, they unfortunately don't have access to it really.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1533.8s	1533.8	 They have empirical sampling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1536.1s	1536.1	 But to say that the US economy is automated in a way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1540.0s	1540.0	 where they can sit in front of some dashboard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1542.7s	1542.7	 and see in real time what the true on the ground data is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1546.8s	1546.8	 is not really accurate, unfortunately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1548.6s	1548.6	 Maybe there's a Manhattan project type
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1552.5s	1552.5	 effort to do that at some point for the United States,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1554.7s	1554.7	 but it's not now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1556.9s	1556.9	 I'll give you a bit of bad news and a bit of good news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1560.8s	1560.8	 And this is just me kind of again looking at the mosaic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1564.0s	1564.0	 and kind of judging where we are today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1568.2s	1568.2	 The bad news is I think that it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1570.5s	1570.5	 going to be a really tough, sticky time for the US consumer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1575.1s	1575.1	 probably over the next 18 months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1578.6s	1578.6	 And so I tend to think that through the course of this year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1582.7s	1582.7	 and through 2023 and possibly even a little bit of 2024,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1588.3s	1588.3	 it's going to be a grind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1590.6s	1590.6	 Unemployment will go back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1594.4s	1594.4	 Inflation will be sticky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1596.7s	1596.7	 Real earnings will shrink.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1599.2s	1599.2	 Consumption will ebb.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1603.8s	1603.8	 And earnings will not be that great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1607.2s	1607.2	 But the silver lining is I think that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1611.1s	1611.1	 are starting a bottoming process for the equity markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1614.5s	1614.5	 And I think that by the end of this year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1616.4s	1616.4	 or the early part of next year, most of that will be done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1621.5s	1621.5	 And the reason is that the equity markets I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1625.4s	1625.4	 do a reasonable job of one, looking at the bond market,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1629.9s	1629.9	 and then two, looking six to nine months into the future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1633.6s	1633.6	 and pricing in that future today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1636.9s	1636.9	 And so by the end of this year, beginning of next year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1639.9s	1639.9	 I think that we will have kind of bottomed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1642.1s	1642.1	 and we'll start to build a base.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1645.0s	1645.0	 The thing to remind us, though, is that let's just say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1647.5s	1647.5	 a stock goes down 50%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1650.2s	1650.2	 Even if it rallies 50% from there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1652.1s	1652.1	 it's still 25% off from where it was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1653.6s	1653.6	 Yeah, people don't understand that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1654.8s	1654.8	 And people don't understand that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1655.9s	1655.9	 How hard is it to climb back up the mountain?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1657.8s	1657.8	 So I would just tell people that I think that David is right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1663.4s	1663.4	 I think that we're going to feel this for a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1668.4s	1668.4	 This inflation, as I've said for a long time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1670.5s	1670.5	 is going to be sticky and persistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1672.8s	1672.8	 I think you're going to see Fed funds at or breaching 5%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1680.0s	1680.0	 But I think that in terms of risk assets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1683.7s	1683.7	 we'll bottom out by the end of this year, beginning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1686.2s	1686.2	 of next year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1687.2s	1687.2	 Freiburg, what are your thoughts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1688.6s	1688.6	 You think we're in the process of bottoming out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1690.8s	1690.8	 and it's going to be a year of this kind of slog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1695.0s	1695.0	 through the muck?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1697.2s	1697.2	 And what signs are you looking for that maybe we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1699.4s	1699.4	 getting out of it or turning a corner?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1701.2s	1701.2	 I mean, Larry Summers had some good tweets this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1706.3s	1706.3	 You know the weird thing is Larry Summers seems to be almost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1709.9s	1709.9	 trying to make the case and make certain points because he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1713.3s	1713.3	 not being listened to?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1716.2s	1716.2	 It's so ironic and sad to watch because he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1720.7s	1720.7	 such a thoughtful economist and has such a great point of view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1725.1s	1725.1	 and experience to leverage here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1727.6s	1727.6	 And clearly, he was banging the drums last year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1731.4s	1731.4	 and no one was listening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1732.5s	1732.5	 And then he got public about it and now he's more repeatedly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1735.8s	1735.8	 public about things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1737.3s	1737.3	 The point that he's made, which I think plays into the political
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1741.1s	1741.1	 cycle question, which is where the tension arises,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1744.1s	1744.1	 is in order to resolve ultimately the inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1747.6s	1747.6	 problem, you're going to have to see a significant increment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1750.2s	1750.2	 in unemployment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1751.6s	1751.6	 And so when you raise interest rates,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1756.6s	1756.6	 generally purchasing goes down, demand goes down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1760.0s	1760.0	 revenue goes down, layoffs happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1763.0s	1763.0	 Some businesses go bankrupt, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1765.2s	1765.2	 So then there's this trickle in the economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1767.0s	1767.0	 of less people being employed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1769.3s	1769.3	 And when that happens, it ultimately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1770.8s	1770.8	 drives a political response, which is, hey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1775.0s	1775.0	 we're losing our jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1776.6s	1776.6	 People start asking their representatives,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1778.3s	1778.3	 do something about this in Congress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1780.5s	1780.5	 And then these programs and these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1782.5s	1782.5	 get passed, which themselves are inflationary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1786.1s	1786.1	 And that's why it's very hard to predict, ultimately,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1789.7s	1789.7	 when and how this all gets resolved,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1792.0s	1792.0	 because we seem to have an administration that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1795.8s	1795.8	 is enacting and embracing inflationary policies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1802.1s	1802.1	 to support what they consider to be economic growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1804.6s	1804.6	 and improved employment conditions in this country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1808.2s	1808.2	 And the unfortunate effect of many of those policies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1810.6s	1810.6	 is inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1811.8s	1811.8	 And then it forces this difficult central bank
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1813.8s	1813.8	 decision-making cycle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1815.4s	1815.4	 And so there's a tension right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1816.6s	1816.6	 that doesn't seem to have a clear path to resolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1819.3s	1819.3	 That is why it's very hard to have a clear prediction here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1823.7s	1823.7	 We also have a very significant question overhanging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1827.1s	1827.1	 all of these markets related to the price of energy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1829.5s	1829.5	 which is a key input to so many industries and drives cost,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1833.9s	1833.9	 as well as food and also the military conflict
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1837.0s	1837.0	 in Eastern Europe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1838.4s	1838.4	 And then there's, in the financial markets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1842.0s	1842.0	 this big overhang question on what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1844.0s	1844.0	 going to happen with various countries that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1845.8s	1845.8	 may default on their debt, as well as China's real estate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1848.5s	1848.5	 bubble bursting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1850.7s	1850.7	 So I made this point, I think, a few episodes ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1853.0s	1853.0	 But there's no easy answer that I can just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1854.9s	1854.9	 say deterministically, here's my prediction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1856.7s	1856.7	 of what's going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1858.0s	1858.0	 As Chamath uses the term, I think it's a great term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1860.1s	1860.1	 There's this mosaic of things that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1861.5s	1861.5	 under consideration right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1863.9s	1863.9	 And there's a tension between them all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1866.1s	1866.1	 And that's what makes it difficult.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1868.4s	1868.4	 I'm sorry I didn't really answer the question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1870.4s	1870.4	 But that's kind of how I think about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1872.5s	1872.5	 There's a lot of geopolitical risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1874.6s	1874.6	 I mean, we're kind of ignoring what happened this week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1877.7s	1877.7	 where Putin basically is putting nukes back on the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1881.2s	1881.2	 Now, I'm not saying that's likely to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1883.1s	1883.1	 But I don't know how, again, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1886.3s	1886.3	 know how this market gets a lot better with the risk of war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1889.0s	1889.0	 three-hanging over our heads.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1890.7s	1890.7	 I mean, who wants to enter the market with that on the table?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1893.1s	1893.1	 And by the way, the nukes, just to be clear,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1896.6s	1896.6	 you can hear certain military commanders speaking publicly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1899.4s	1899.4	 about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1900.8s	1900.8	 But in the Russian military playbooks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1906.0s	1906.0	 there is specifically defined actions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1909.3s	1909.3	 that can lead to tactical nuclear weapon use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1912.5s	1912.5	 in the field.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1913.3s	1913.3	 There's no direct indication that these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1915.2s	1915.2	 are going to be used right away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1916.6s	1916.6	 But as Sachs says, there's this weird turning up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1920.9s	1920.9	 the volume happening on, hey, maybe we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1923.4s	1923.4	 getting closer to a point where if Putin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1925.7s	1925.7	 is having tactical failure in this conflict,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1929.2s	1929.2	 there's more weaponry he can use that has greater impact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1932.0s	1932.0	 And unfortunately, there are these tactical nukes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1934.3s	1934.3	 in his arsenal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1936.2s	1936.2	 And a guy that maybe has a certain psychology that has,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1940.6s	1940.6	 as our friends have said, his back against the wall,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1943.8s	1943.8	 he's not a person who in his career or in his history
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1948.0s	1948.0	 has ever acquiesced to defeat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1949.7s	1949.7	 Alex Karp was on CNBC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1951.2s	1951.2	 He was really, really sharp and concise about this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1954.6s	1954.6	 which is that in the West, when leaders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1958.7s	1958.7	 fail in their objectives, they just get elected out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1962.3s	1962.3	 and somebody else takes their place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1965.0s	1965.0	 But for somebody like Putin, there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1966.4s	1966.4	 is nobody to take his place because it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1968.4s	1968.4	 a very zero sum situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1970.7s	1970.7	 And so his actions will, as a result, also be zero sum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1973.3s	1973.3	 And I think folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1974.3s	1974.3	 He's never acquiesced in his life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1977.3s	1977.3	 Yeah, we've never really kind of like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1979.8s	1979.8	 we don't understand well what zero sum decision making looks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1983.2s	1983.2	 like when it comes to stuff like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1984.6s	1984.6	 He needs the golden bridge, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1986.0s	1986.0	 You can give him the golden bridge out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1987.6s	1987.6	 He does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1988.2s	1988.2	 I'll just say two things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1989.5s	1989.5	 One is that I think it's been made pretty clear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1994.3s	1994.3	 that both India and China will not stand beside Russia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1997.2s	1997.2	 if they do something like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=1999.1s	1999.1	 And I think that that is important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2000.6s	2000.6	 because they still are the two biggest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2002.2s	2002.2	 purchasers of Russian oil.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2004.5s	2004.5	 And so I think that matters a lot because you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2006.4s	2006.4	 talking about a lot of revenue that would go away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2009.2s	2009.2	 And then the second is, I mentioned this last week,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2011.3s	2011.3	 and this may sound dumb to some of you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2013.2s	2013.2	 but don't sleep on the Russian mothers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2016.2s	2016.2	 And what happened this week was really interesting, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2020.7s	2020.7	 is that he calls up all these reservists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2022.5s	2022.5	 These reservists are not coming from the major cities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2024.7s	2024.7	 of Russia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2025.3s	2025.3	 You're starting to see protests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2026.7s	2026.7	 You're starting to see young people saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2028.0s	2028.0	 I don't want to do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2029.5s	2029.5	 And who's that really activating?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2031.2s	2031.2	 It's activating the moms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2033.8s	2033.8	 And so don't sleep on the Russian moms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2036.0s	2036.0	 300 people are being drafted to basically go fight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2041.1s	2041.1	 I actually think that's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2042.6s	2042.6	 Oh, sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2043.0s	2043.0	 Sorry, go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2043.6s	2043.6	 The question I have for you is, do you think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2045.8s	2045.8	 I know you don't agree with this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2047.3s	2047.3	 but do you think the strategy is to back him into a corner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2051.5s	2051.5	 and then have this rhetoric spike
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2053.5s	2053.5	 to then force a resolution?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2055.0s	2055.0	 I know it's a danger strategy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2056.4s	2056.4	 It's a crazy chess move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2058.0s	2058.0	 But do you think that's actually what the West is thinking?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2061.4s	2061.4	 I see no evidence that we have any intentions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2065.2s	2065.2	 of seeking a diplomatic off-ramp.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2067.8s	2067.8	 I see no evidence that they're looking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2070.3s	2070.3	 to give him a golden bridge, like you said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2072.3s	2072.3	 Then do you think they're trying to break him and have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2074.8s	2074.8	 regime change?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2075.3s	2075.3	 I think Biden stated the policy, which is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2077.1s	2077.1	 this man cannot remain in power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2078.5s	2078.5	 I think he blurted out the truth of his policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2080.8s	2080.8	 This is a regime change policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2082.2s	2082.2	 That's what they're going for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2083.6s	2083.6	 They are backing him into a corner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2085.0s	2085.0	 Jacob, I thought that you were right this whole time, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2087.5s	2087.5	 is, we're going to build a golden bridge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2089.3s	2089.3	 We're going to find a way to egress this guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2091.2s	2091.2	 And I'm now sort of in the David camp, which is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2093.8s	2093.8	 I think that the stated strategy of the Western Alliance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2098.5s	2098.5	 is essentially to cause him to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2100.6s	2100.6	 such a categorically catastrophic mistake so as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2103.8s	2103.8	 to become a pariah, so as to either get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2105.8s	2105.8	 overthrown or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2108.3s	2108.3	 So I do think that, on balance, the risk is now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2111.9s	2111.9	 for things to escalate, maybe not in quantity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2117.2s	2117.2	 And I'll use this word in the wrong way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2118.8s	2118.8	 but quote unquote, the intensity of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2122.7s	2122.7	 So I think David's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2124.8s	2124.8	 It's a lot of pressure to the economy and to the risk assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2128.9s	2128.9	 High risk strategy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2129.7s	2129.7	 It is a high risk strategy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2130.5s	2130.5	 We've got a good thing going over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2132.1s	2132.1	 I don't see the need for all this risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2134.6s	2134.6	 So look, and part of the problem I have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2136.3s	2136.3	 The risk would be the reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2137.3s	2137.3	 What would you see the reward if Putin was removed?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2139.4s	2139.4	 Oh, my lord.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2140.7s	2140.7	 Well, it depends who replaces him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2142.2s	2142.2	 What if we get a hardliner?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2143.3s	2143.3	 You've got to remember, Putin's taken out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2144.6s	2144.6	 all the liberal reformers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2145.8s	2145.8	 All that's left are hardliners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2147.4s	2147.4	 So I know there's moms protesting in the streets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2149.8s	2149.8	 but he's also under intense pressure from his right wing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2155.8s	2155.8	 He's got hawks on his side who basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2158.1s	2158.1	 have been criticizing him for making
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2160.5s	2160.5	 this a special limited military operation instead of a war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2163.2s	2163.2	 They're like, why did you try to do this with 200,000 troops?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2166.0s	2166.0	 We should have gone in heavy with a million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2167.4s	2167.4	 Oh, is that right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2168.0s	2168.0	 There's criticism internally of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2170.0s	2170.0	 There's a New York Times article about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2172.0s	2172.0	 He has his own military hardliners
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2175.3s	2175.3	 in his security state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2176.7s	2176.7	 His hawks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2178.1s	2178.1	 So he's not just under pressure from peaceniks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2180.6s	2180.6	 who are protesting in the streets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2182.2s	2182.2	 He's also under pressure from hardliners
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2184.1s	2184.1	 in his own government who think he's been too soft.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2187.5s	2187.5	 Yeah, it's a challenging situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2190.5s	2190.5	 And he's going to be 70 years old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2192.3s	2192.3	 How many years does he have left?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2193.6s	2193.6	 We just need to contain him for a decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2195.3s	2195.3	 Time was on our side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2196.3s	2196.3	 I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2196.6s	2196.6	 Yeah, contain him for more and more decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2198.4s	2198.4	 That's my best idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2199.6s	2199.6	 Contain him for a decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2200.7s	2200.7	 The thing I have the most trouble with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2202.4s	2202.4	 is if you look at the media portrayal of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2204.4s	2204.4	 So I said last week when we had this successful counteroffensive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2208.6s	2208.6	 that maybe we'll get what we want,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2210.4s	2210.4	 which is Russian morale collapses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2211.7s	2211.7	 and they just tuck their tail between their legs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2213.7s	2213.7	 and go back to Moscow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2214.8s	2214.8	 Or maybe the Russians really do see this war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2218.0s	2218.0	 as existential for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2219.0s	2219.0	 Putin sees it as existential for himself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2221.6s	2221.6	 And he escalates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2222.8s	2222.8	 Well, what happened this week?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2223.8s	2223.8	 We went up a rung on the escalatory ladder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2226.3s	2226.3	 Basically Putin drew down 300,000 more troops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2229.7s	2229.7	 And he's basically indicated his willingness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2232.1s	2232.1	 to use tactical nukes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2233.5s	2233.5	 And he's basically said, I'm not bluffing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2235.8s	2235.8	 So now what is the reaction in the American press?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2238.1s	2238.1	 He must be bluffing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2239.4s	2239.4	 I mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2240.4s	2240.4	 That basically is the reaction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2241.9s	2241.9	 And look, I don't know how you know that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2245.3s	2245.3	 You know, in poker, what you in poker,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2247.4s	2247.4	 what do we do when someone might be,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2249.5s	2249.5	 we put them on a range.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2250.7s	2250.7	 It's called a hand range, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2251.9s	2251.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2252.3s	2252.3	 You can't possibly know exactly what they're going to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2255.4s	2255.4	 or what cards are holding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2256.7s	2256.7	 So you put them on a range of possible hands
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2258.3s	2258.3	 and then you evaluate the story
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2260.5s	2260.5	 in light of their past actions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2261.9s	2261.9	 What do they do before the flop on the flop?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2264.0s	2264.0	 And you basically come to an assessment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2266.9s	2266.9	 of what is likely based on their story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2269.0s	2269.0	 Now take Putin's story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2270.2s	2270.2	 Like Friedberg said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2271.2s	2271.2	 he's never backed down in his life from anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2274.0s	2274.0	 He has said this war is existential.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2276.1s	2276.1	 You know, he basically threatened to invade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2278.0s	2278.0	 And so he did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2278.8s	2278.8	 I mean, like, I don't know how you can immediately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2281.0s	2281.0	 jump to the conclusion this is just a bluff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2282.8s	2282.8	 Maybe it is, but.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2284.3s	2284.3	 Well, it could still be a bluff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2286.4s	2286.4	 But then to your point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2287.7s	2287.7	 the range of outcomes does include
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2289.8s	2289.8	 shoving on the river, moving all in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2292.0s	2292.0	 He can move all in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2293.0s	2293.0	 He's a KGB agent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2294.3s	2294.3	 Do you want to play poker with a KGB agent, with nukes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2297.5s	2297.5	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2298.3s	2298.3	 And so Jason, you've said throughout this guy's a madman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2300.1s	2300.1	 Well, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2300.9s	2300.9	 I mean, personally, I think he's more like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2302.9s	2302.9	 ruthless mafia boss than a madman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2305.2s	2305.2	 But let's say you're right that he is a madman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2307.2s	2307.2	 What is the story about what we're doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2311.2s	2311.2	 that makes sense if he is a madman?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2313.8s	2313.8	 Why would we want to basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2314.9s	2314.9	 back him into a corner like that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2316.6s	2316.6	 Why wouldn't we give him the golden off ramp?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2318.7s	2318.7	 And by the way, just on this idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2320.1s	2320.1	 that no one would ever use tactical nukes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2323.2s	2323.2	 Let me just give you three data points.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2324.4s	2324.4	 First of all, we use them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2325.8s	2325.8	 We dropped two atomic bombs on Japan to end World War II.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2329.6s	2329.6	 We could have won that war without doing it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2331.1s	2331.1	 but we didn't want to lose the troops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2332.5s	2332.5	 Well, no, wait, those were tactical nukes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2334.6s	2334.6	 They were tactical nuke-sized atomic bombs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2337.4s	2337.4	 Number two, MacArthur wanted to use 20 to 30 atomic bombs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2342.7s	2342.7	 to end the Korean War.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2343.8s	2343.8	 He had a whole plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2345.0s	2345.0	 Truman fired him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2346.1s	2346.1	 He thought he basically had jumped the shark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2348.0s	2348.0	 But MacArthur was the most respected
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2350.8s	2350.8	 and admired American in 1950.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2352.8s	2352.8	 And the reason why Truman could not run for your elections
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2355.2s	2355.2	 because he fired MacArthur.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2356.4s	2356.4	 MacArthur would have used basically the equivalent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2358.9s	2358.9	 of tactical nukes to win the Korean War.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2361.3s	2361.3	 And his plan to prevent China from reinvading from the North
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2365.4s	2365.4	 was to irradiate the border so completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2368.6s	2368.6	 that Chinese troops could not go through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2370.0s	2370.0	 Keep in mind, there wasn't as many nukes at the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2372.2s	2372.2	 So we weren't up against nine different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2373.6s	2373.6	 nuclear-enabled countries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2374.6s	2374.6	 I understand, but we had an American commander
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2376.5s	2376.5	 ahead of our military who was willing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2378.4s	2378.4	 to use nukes to win a war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2379.9s	2379.9	 So this idea that he wouldn't, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2381.8s	2381.8	 we've been willing to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2383.1s	2383.1	 And the third example is obviously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2384.3s	2384.3	 the Cuban Missile Crisis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2385.3s	2385.3	 All of Kennedy's military advisors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2387.6s	2387.6	 were willing to use nukes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2389.2s	2389.2	 I mean, and the best thing Kennedy did was not listen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2392.3s	2392.3	 to his military advisors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2393.6s	2393.6	 They were all super hawkish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2395.5s	2395.5	 And Kennedy, what did he do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2396.9s	2396.9	 He looked for a way out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2397.8s	2397.8	 He looked for a compromise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2399.2s	2399.2	 He sent Bobby Kennedy to go cut a secret deal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2402.4s	2402.4	 with the Russians where Kennedy agreed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2404.6s	2404.6	 to pull the R-Jupiter missiles out of Turkey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2407.8s	2407.8	 if the Russians would pull their missiles out of Cuba.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2410.3s	2410.3	 And then he lied to the American public about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2412.0s	2412.0	 because he didn't want to be perceived as backing down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2415.0s	2415.0	 But that's the kind of flexibility and mental acuity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2419.0s	2419.0	 that I think you would need in a nuclear showdown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2421.6s	2421.6	 to avoid a catastrophe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2423.0s	2423.0	 If things do escalate to the point of a nuclear showdown,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2425.6s	2425.6	 do we believe that we have leadership
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2428.0s	2428.0	 on the level of a Jack Kennedy or a Bobby Kennedy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2430.1s	2430.1	 who can basically show the flexibility and adaptability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2433.1s	2433.1	 to cut a deal to basically pull us back from the brink?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2436.5s	2436.5	 Yeah, it doesn't seem like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2437.8s	2437.8	 What was Biden's response?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2439.0s	2439.0	 It was he gave this speech to the United Nations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2442.0s	2442.0	 in response to Putin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2443.6s	2443.6	 And it's more of the same as more of this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2445.8s	2445.8	 as I call it the Abe Simpson speech,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2447.2s	2447.2	 this old man yelling at the cloud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2449.6s	2449.6	 I mean, he's basically just yelling at a teleprompter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2451.7s	2451.7	 Now, I think the strategically smart play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2455.0s	2455.0	 would have been to say, listen, Putin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2457.0s	2457.0	 you said that you want the people of Ukraine to decide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2460.1s	2460.1	 where these territories go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2461.6s	2461.6	 Okay, we can hold a referendum,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2463.4s	2463.4	 but we want it administered by the United Nations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2465.3s	2465.3	 so it'll have some credibility behind it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2469.2s	2469.2	 I mean, why not throw that out there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2470.9s	2470.9	 as a potential way to get diplomacy started?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2474.6s	2474.6	 It felt like at the end of last year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2477.8s	2477.8	 you guys remember I thought conflict was likely this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2482.0s	2482.0	 I don't think that the conditions that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2487.9s	2487.9	 I was referencing have really gotten better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2490.0s	2490.0	 I think they've gotten worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2491.7s	2491.7	 And that's why I think we all talk about this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2494.7s	2494.7	 in a rational way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2496.2s	2496.2	 meaning like how the conscious mind would,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2499.9s	2499.9	 debate the merits and challenges and risks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2502.7s	2502.7	 of having a golden bridge or continuing conflict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2507.4s	2507.4	 But if you look historically,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2510.3s	2510.3	 the US has often been in the middle of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2513.5s	2513.5	 or at the tail end of some either recessionary cycle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2518.3s	2518.3	 or inflationary cycle when conflict escalated externally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2523.2s	2523.2	 Wag the dog you're referring to?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2525.8s	2525.8	 I don't know if I would call it that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2527.2s	2527.2	 but I think that there is an innate human anxiety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2532.5s	2532.5	 When things aren't going well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2533.9s	2533.9	 you feel like you have to do something about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2535.6s	2535.6	 And you're either gonna have internal conflict
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2537.8s	2537.8	 or external conflict as a result to try and resolve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2541.0s	2541.0	 When things are going great, the economy is booming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2544.8s	2544.8	 You don't enter a war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2546.4s	2546.4	 You don't start a conflict with a nation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2548.2s	2548.2	 when people are happy at home,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2550.0s	2550.0	 when your constituents and the unemployment rate is low
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2555.3s	2555.3	 and job wage growth is high, the economy is growing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2559.3s	2559.3	 Are you referring to the United States
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2560.4s	2560.4	 or Russia in this case?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2562.2s	2562.2	 I'm referring to the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2563.5s	2563.5	 And I think-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2564.3s	2564.3	 I'm just curious if you would-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2565.5s	2565.5	 Coming out of COVID and coming out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2568.6s	2568.6	 the big question marks that loomed over our economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2571.4s	2571.4	 at the end of last year around inflation, economic growth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2578.2s	2578.2	 interest rates and the effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2579.4s	2579.4	 And now we're in the middle of the turmoil.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2582.0s	2582.0	 Markets are down 30%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2584.2s	2584.2	 And in some cases, 70 to 80% for high growth markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2588.3s	2588.3	 There's an inevitability now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2590.2s	2590.2	 that unemployment is gonna rise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2591.8s	2591.8	 There is an inevitability now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2593.0s	2593.0	 that the economy is gonna contract.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2597.0s	2597.0	 Leadership is more likely in that scenario
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2599.4s	2599.4	 to find an outlet, to find a place of conflict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2603.0s	2603.0	 And I don't think it's a conscious decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2603.8s	2603.8	 Explain why in this theory, explain why.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2606.4s	2606.4	 Why would dog understand the conflict?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2608.3s	2608.3	 Is that what you're saying, Freeberg, wag the dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2609.6s	2609.6	 Yeah, I don't think it's a conscious decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2611.8s	2611.8	 I don't think that it's like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2612.8s	2612.8	 hey, let's go start a war with Russia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2614.4s	2614.4	 because the economy is bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2616.0s	2616.0	 I think it's this anxiety, the economy is bad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2618.3s	2618.3	 and there's not a lot we can do about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2620.1s	2620.1	 And over here on the other hand, there's a problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2622.4s	2622.4	 and there's something we can do about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2623.5s	2623.5	 We can build strength and we can build integrity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2625.9s	2625.9	 and we can build support
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2627.6s	2627.6	 and we can get people to get behind something together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2630.8s	2630.8	 And we can get something to create a driving mechanism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2634.8s	2634.8	 to achieve something big.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2635.9s	2635.9	 It's like a distraction you're saying, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2637.8s	2637.8	 Yeah, and I don't think that psychology is as simple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2640.5s	2640.5	 as a distraction or a wag the dog or,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2642.7s	2642.7	 hey, it's not even as simple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2643.9s	2643.9	 as the military industrial complex will see revenue growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2646.6s	2646.6	 and wage growth and that'll drive the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2648.5s	2648.5	 But I think all those things together are true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2650.9s	2650.9	 And I think in whole, we are more likely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2654.4s	2654.4	 to wanna pursue conflict right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2656.4s	2656.4	 than we were even a year ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2658.5s	2658.5	 You buy any of that, Jamath?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2659.8s	2659.8	 I think he's more right than wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2662.0s	2662.0	 I think that when things aren't easy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2668.7s	2668.7	 you need to find sort of distractions essentially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2673.0s	2673.0	 to get people to focus on other things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2676.8s	2676.8	 so that the core problem isn't as obvious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2678.6s	2678.6	 We have in the United States, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2680.6s	2680.6	 Yeah, let's go create another problem that's solvable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2682.7s	2682.7	 Yeah, I think the best way that I can describe this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2685.2s	2685.2	 as I see it is institutional rot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2689.2s	2689.2	 And the more that we're left to our own devices,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2692.7s	2692.7	 that amount of institutional decay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2694.2s	2694.2	 becomes more and more obvious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2696.6s	2696.6	 Our governments don't work the way that they should.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2699.7s	2699.7	 Our state assemblies are basically co-opted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2701.8s	2701.8	 by special interests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2703.8s	2703.8	 The federal institutions we rely on to make rules
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2706.1s	2706.1	 are not that great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2707.5s	2707.5	 Enormous amounts of money get wasted every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2710.1s	2710.1	 And as more and more people become aware of these things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2714.2s	2714.2	 it's just the trend is just so bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2717.1s	2717.1	 Civic engagement goes down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2718.4s	2718.4	 Everything just gets worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2720.5s	2720.5	 And so when you take that, and then on top of that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2723.8s	2723.8	 you sit it on a poor economy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2726.4s	2726.4	 that is a real powder keg, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2728.6s	2728.6	 And so folks like to, I think if you're a politician,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2732.2s	2732.2	 it's easier to kind of go and point to Taiwan and say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2735.8s	2735.8	 we're gonna go and defend these folks if there's a war,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2738.7s	2738.7	 point to Russia and say this, point to all these other things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2742.5s	2742.5	 Whether it's implicit, as Friedberg says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2744.4s	2744.4	 or it's more explicit of a strategy, I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2747.3s	2747.3	 But the underlying cause is the same,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2748.8s	2748.8	 which is that if the foundation of the house is not strong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2753.7s	2753.7	 and you're not sure what to do to fix it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2755.6s	2755.6	 or you don't have the courage to fix it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2758.2s	2758.2	 the better strategic alternative is to distract
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2760.6s	2760.6	 and talk about your neighbor's house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2762.2s	2762.2	 Coming out of the financial crisis in 2008, 2009,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2765.5s	2765.5	 Obama recommitted to Afghanistan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2767.2s	2767.2	 and sent 17,000 troops to Afghanistan in early 2009
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2770.7s	2770.7	 when he took office.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2772.1s	2772.1	 We entered the Persian Gulf with the Gulf War in 1991,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2774.8s	2774.8	 coming out of the Great Recession,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2776.1s	2776.1	 or the mild recession, 1990 to 1991.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2780.1s	2780.1	 2000, 2001 dot com crash, we obviously entered Iraq.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2788.5s	2788.5	 Yeah, well that was post 9-11.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2790.4s	2790.4	 It was post 9-11, but it was also in the midst of a recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2795.0s	2795.0	 and coming out of the dot com crash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2796.6s	2796.6	 That one was clearly a reaction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2797.8s	2797.8	 Is that you buy this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2798.6s	2798.6	 Do you think this is a wag the dog or?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2801.3s	2801.3	 And by the way, you can do the same analysis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2803.4s	2803.4	 on the time we entered the Korean War
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2805.1s	2805.1	 and the time we entered the Vietnam War,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2806.9s	2806.9	 they were both tied to recessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2808.7s	2808.7	 And so I don't know how explicit this action
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2812.3s	2812.3	 and behavior is, but I just think there's some data to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2815.2s	2815.2	 There was a study that just came out by Tufts University
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2818.6s	2818.6	 on American military interventions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2821.4s	2821.4	 throughout American history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2822.6s	2822.6	 And what they found was that we had the least
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2827.4s	2827.4	 in the period before the Cold War.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2829.5s	2829.5	 Then the second most was during the Cold War.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2832.9s	2832.9	 But actually the most hyperactive period
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2835.3s	2835.3	 of American military interventions was post Cold War.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2838.4s	2838.4	 So since the unipolar moment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2840.6s	2840.6	 even though it's been the safest period for America, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2844.5s	2844.5	 We haven't-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2845.3s	2845.3	 Explain unipolar for people who don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2846.9s	2846.9	 Just that there's only one great power in the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2849.7s	2849.7	 Before during the Cold War, it was a bipolar world,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2852.1s	2852.1	 whereas basically America versus the Soviet Union
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2854.4s	2854.4	 and you had basically had the NATO and the Western Alliance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2858.4s	2858.4	 and the so-called free world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2859.6s	2859.6	 And then you have the-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2860.4s	2860.4	 Perceived check and balance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2861.3s	2861.3	 Perceived check and balance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2862.1s	2862.1	 Warsaw Pact on the other side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2863.6s	2863.6	 And now we have unipolar moving to bipolar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2865.5s	2865.5	 Well, it was, yeah, we were unipolar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2867.7s	2867.7	 for a couple of decades,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2869.4s	2869.4	 but now we're moving towards multipolar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2871.6s	2871.6	 or at least bipolar with China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2873.5s	2873.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2874.3s	2874.3	 Multipolar would be maybe including India.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2878.5s	2878.5	 Maybe including-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2879.3s	2879.3	 India, Brazil, China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2880.8s	2880.8	 In the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2881.6s	2881.6	 In the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2882.6s	2882.6	 But so the irony is that the safer America has become,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2887.6s	2887.6	 the more we've gotten militarily involved overseas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2891.7s	2891.7	 And part of that is because there's no great power
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2893.4s	2893.4	 in the system to oppose us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2895.5s	2895.5	 But it's also gotten us in a lot of trouble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2897.2s	2897.2	 I mean, all of these wars in the Middle East
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2900.1s	2900.1	 that cost us something like $8 trillion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2902.6s	2902.6	 Another survey, cost of war study,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2905.1s	2905.1	 the direct number of deaths from these wars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2907.0s	2907.0	 from the war on terror was over a million lives lost,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2910.2s	2910.2	 $8 trillion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2911.7s	2911.7	 And that doesn't even include the excess mortality caused
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2914.3s	2914.3	 by the destruction of infrastructure,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2918.7s	2918.7	 famine, all that kind of stuff,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2919.9s	2919.9	 which could be as high as five million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2921.0s	2921.0	 And you know the crazy part about that, Sax?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2922.8s	2922.8	 That $8 trillion, if we had deployed that in energy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2925.4s	2925.4	 independence, solar, nuclear, whatever,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2928.3s	2928.3	 the whole reason to be in the Middle East was oil and energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2931.9s	2931.9	 And we could have just deployed that to be energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2934.3s	2934.3	 independent in the West and not had all of this pain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2937.6s	2937.6	 Not the whole, I mean, not the whole reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2938.9s	2938.9	 I think the reason to be in Afghanistan was to kill us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2941.2s	2941.2	 on the big line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2942.1s	2942.1	 With the exception of 9-11 and maybe-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2942.9s	2942.9	 We could have done that without taking over the whole country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2945.3s	2945.3	 and gone on this 20-year nation building effort.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2946.7s	2946.7	 Yeah, that could have been done very strategically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2947.9s	2947.9	 I mean, actually that was really proven when,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2949.7s	2949.7	 well, first of all, we did kill,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2952.7s	2952.7	 we did kill Bin Laden in Pakistan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2955.0s	2955.0	 with just a raid by the Seals, an infiltration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2958.4s	2958.4	 Two helicopters-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2959.2s	2959.2	 So we didn't need to occupy that country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2960.2s	2960.2	 And then more recently, we finally got Zawahiri
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2962.7s	2962.7	 in Afghanistan-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2963.9s	2963.9	 Drones, right. Using a drone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2965.4s	2965.4	 after we left the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2966.6s	2966.6	 So what the hell do we need to be there for-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2968.1s	2968.1	 We don't. For 20 years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2969.1s	2969.1	 when we could kill these guys using drones
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2971.4s	2971.4	 and a helicopter team.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2974.5s	2974.5	 Yeah, this is where we needed to have an adversary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2977.3s	2977.3	 who could check our power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2978.5s	2978.5	 And I think that would have been healthier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2979.6s	2979.6	 is I guess the premise to the tough study.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2981.9s	2981.9	 Right, but look, I think to Freeberg's point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2984.2s	2984.2	 is it, do we become more militaristic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2987.6s	2987.6	 when things aren't going well at home?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2989.0s	2989.0	 I don't know, but it feels to me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2990.8s	2990.8	 like just in general over the last 30 years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2992.8s	2992.8	 we've become hyper militaristic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2995.4s	2995.4	 The use of military force is typically the first option
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=2999.4s	2999.4	 and we resort to it too quickly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3000.7s	3000.7	 and we don't use diplomacy enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3002.2s	3002.2	 And you can see that in just the number of lives lost,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3005.2s	3005.2	 failure of these wars and the enormous deficit we're running.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3009.8s	3009.8	 As you know, Sax, I can't stand Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3012.2s	3012.2	 The two things he got right, no wars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3015.0s	3015.0	 And he was the dictator whisperer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3016.7s	3016.7	 That guy knew how to talk to a dictator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3020.0s	3020.0	 Whether it was North Korea, China, Russia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3023.1s	3023.1	 he just knew how to bond with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3024.6s	3024.6	 It was like a superpower for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3026.1s	3026.1	 Okay, we have three directions to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3027.0s	3027.0	 Listen, if that keeps us out of war, it's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3029.2s	3029.2	 I mean, it's literally his only saving grace.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3032.1s	3032.1	 All right, gentlemen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3034.2s	3034.2	 we have to talk about what's going on in Iran.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3036.4s	3036.4	 We have to talk about the Wall Street editorial boards,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3039.4s	3039.4	 California, maybe?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3040.9s	3040.9	 Talk about Newsom because there's a bunch of energy stuff happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3043.4s	3043.4	 and the United States really think it's important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3045.2s	3045.2	 All right, so the Wall Street Journal editorial board,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3048.8s	3048.8	 which obviously has a side,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3050.1s	3050.1	 wrote an op-ed on California's grid issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3053.3s	3053.3	 Some of the quotes from the op-ed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3055.2s	3055.2	 California can barely keep the lights on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3057.5s	3057.5	 as its climate policies bite the electric grid,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3061.4s	3061.4	 but Gavid Newsom is undaunted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3063.0s	3063.0	 On Friday, he signed no fewer than 40 new climate bills
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3066.5s	3066.5	 to amp up California's green energy stock shock experiment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3070.6s	3070.6	 Even as gasoline prices nationwide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3072.5s	3072.5	 have fallen to an average of $3.68 a gallon,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3075.2s	3075.2	 Californians are still paying $5.45 a gallon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3078.9s	3078.9	 California's electric rates are already more than double those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3081.4s	3081.4	 in neighboring states.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3082.3s	3082.3	 This is what happens when politicians try to eliminate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3084.4s	3084.4	 fossil fuels with a Molotov cocktail of regulation taxes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3088.5s	3088.5	 and renewable mandates and subsidies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3092.0s	3092.0	 The coda to this is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3095.4s	3095.4	 I'll send it to you, Nick,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3096.3s	3096.3	 but can you please play the clip as well of Rashida Tlaib
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3099.7s	3099.7	 trying to skewer Jamie Dimon where he just destroys her?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3103.3s	3103.3	 Oh my God, that's embarrassing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3104.6s	3104.6	 That was embarrassing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3106.1s	3106.1	 I mean, we should play it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3107.1s	3107.1	 I mean, it's, she made no sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3110.2s	3110.2	 Nick, can you play that clip, please?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3112.6s	3112.6	 You have all committed, as you all know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3114.5s	3114.5	 to transition the emissions from lending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3117.0s	3117.0	 and investment activities to line with pathways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3119.4s	3119.4	 to net zero on 2050.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3121.3s	3121.3	 Do you know what the International Energy Agency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3125.2s	3125.2	 has said is required to meet our global 2015 net
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3129.0s	3129.0	 zero targets of limiting global temperature rise

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3136.0s	3136.0	 So no new fossil fuel production starting today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3140.6s	3140.6	 So that's like zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3142.4s	3142.4	 So I would like to ask all of you and go down the list
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3145.7s	3145.7	 because again, you all have agreed to doing this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3148.0s	3148.0	 Please answer with a simple yes or no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3150.1s	3150.1	 Does your bank have a policy against funding

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3156.0s	3156.0	 Absolutely not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3156.9s	3156.9	 And that would be the road to hell for America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3159.0s	3159.0	 Yeah, that's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3160.0s	3160.0	 That's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3160.8s	3160.8	 Sir, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3161.6s	3161.6	 Everybody that got relief from student loans

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3165.7s	3165.7	 should probably take out their account
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3168.3s	3168.3	 and close their account.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3169.5s	3169.5	 The fact that you're not even there to help relief
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3172.0s	3172.0	 many of the folks that are in debt,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3173.9s	3173.9	 extreme debt because of student loan debt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3175.6s	3175.6	 and you're out there criticizing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3177.8s	3177.8	 My favorite was when she said, sell us this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3180.2s	3180.2	 That was the, I was like, okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3184.0s	3184.0	 It's just so much theatrics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3185.6s	3185.6	 Rashidah Tlaib represents the 13th district,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3188.0s	3188.0	 congressional district in Michigan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3192.2s	3192.2	 The median age in that district is 35.9 years old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3198.3s	3198.3	 The 2020 poverty rate is 28.2%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3201.5s	3201.5	 So more than almost one in three people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3204.4s	3204.4	 And the 2020 median household income is $37,601.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3209.8s	3209.8	 So she represents a group of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3214.5s	3214.5	 that I think at best is lower middle class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3220.1s	3220.1	 And the idea that she doesn't even basically understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3223.4s	3223.4	 what would happen in her district
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3225.3s	3225.3	 if you actually did not have cheap LNG,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3229.8s	3229.8	 again, just kind of speaks to the institutional kind of decay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3234.1s	3234.1	 in Washington.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3236.0s	3236.0	 She is not the person that should be advocating for this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3238.8s	3238.8	 Like, it's districts like this more than any other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3241.8s	3241.8	 that don't have the money to spend on very expensive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3247.0s	3247.0	 solar installations that cost 30 and $40,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3249.9s	3249.9	 These are the districts that need coal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3252.8s	3252.8	 coal fired plants, LNG, oil to keep going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3258.4s	3258.4	 to sort of minimize the impacts of inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3261.3s	3261.3	 And so, that was just like a grandstanding moment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3264.2s	3264.2	 of moving to California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3265.1s	3265.1	 I just hate these hearings because Jamath,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3266.4s	3266.4	 these are important discussions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3268.0s	3268.0	 and they've become theatrics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3269.9s	3269.9	 and this is a chance to educate the public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3272.9s	3272.9	 with some charts and data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3274.6s	3274.6	 She's either so hungry for power
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3276.4s	3276.4	 that she actually doesn't care about her constituents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3280.5s	3280.5	 or she's scientifically and numerically illiterate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3284.9s	3284.9	 That's I think the latter is probably the issue here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3287.7s	3287.7	 And so this is what's such a shame.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3289.7s	3289.7	 On the other side,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3292.0s	3292.0	 at the other end of the coast in California,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3296.5s	3296.5	 the cost of power generation, just so you guys know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3299.3s	3299.3	 has fallen by 90% when you look at renewables.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3302.6s	3302.6	 And that is because of a good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3304.6s	3304.6	 that the federal government did in introducing subsidies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3308.0s	3308.0	 that essentially gave the right sets of incentives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3311.4s	3311.4	 for people to build this infrastructure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3313.6s	3313.6	 But while the cost of generating renewable power
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3316.6s	3316.6	 has fallen by 90%, virtually it's on par
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3319.9s	3319.9	 and it's cheaper than any other form of generation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3322.6s	3322.6	 your electricity costs have doubled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3324.6s	3324.6	 and are probably gonna double again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3326.2s	3326.2	 in a state like California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3327.7s	3327.7	 So we're cagering our utility rates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3330.9s	3330.9	 by seven to 11% every year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3334.8s	3334.8	 That is unsustainable in California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3337.4s	3337.4	 And what do you have?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3338.6s	3338.6	 You have again, a different version of the same flu
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3342.0s	3342.0	 that Rashida Tlaib has,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3343.4s	3343.4	 which is you run forward to kind of virtue signal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3346.4s	3346.4	 and to try to do all of these things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3348.5s	3348.5	 you don't spend enough time to really understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3350.4s	3350.4	 what's happening on the ground and you make it impossible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3353.6s	3353.6	 for people to make the decisions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3355.0s	3355.0	 to actually be resilient for themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3358.2s	3358.2	 At the end of the day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3359.6s	3359.6	 there are tens of utilities in America,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3362.3s	3362.3	 but there are a hundred million households.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3364.8s	3364.8	 And the only path to energy independence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3366.8s	3366.8	 is to get every single hundred million household
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3369.8s	3369.8	 to be resilient,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3370.9s	3370.9	 which means they need their own solar panels,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3373.3s	3373.3	 they need battery storage,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3374.9s	3374.9	 they need their own potable water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3376.8s	3376.8	 And all of these systems are now affordable and available.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3380.4s	3380.4	 And now the federal government with the IRA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3383.3s	3383.3	 has created the financial incentives to pull it forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3386.6s	3386.6	 So, I don't know, I just think like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3388.6s	3388.6	 this is a hugely stark reminder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3390.2s	3390.2	 about how poorly our energy policy has been managed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3392.6s	3392.6	 And if you leave it to the hands of the progressive left,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3397.0s	3397.0	 they will do things that don't map
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3398.7s	3398.7	 to what people on the ground actually need.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3401.0s	3401.0	 People in California, most people in California
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3404.5s	3404.5	 cannot pay utility rates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3406.4s	3406.4	 that are going to double every six and seven years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3409.1s	3409.1	 Just like people in the congressional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3411.4s	3411.4	 13th district of Michigan cannot afford to pay for solar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3415.8s	3415.8	 if Rashida Tlaib is able to get,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3418.2s	3418.2	 all these banks do not finance LNG, coal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3420.9s	3420.9	 and other forms of hydrocarbons as a bridge fuel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3425.5s	3425.5	 For the next 15, 20 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3426.4s	3426.4	 You have to look at all 40 of these bills independently,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3428.5s	3428.5	 and you have to think about-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3429.8s	3429.8	 40 bills?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3430.6s	3430.6	 I mean, who's reading these things?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3432.1s	3432.1	 What is in these things?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3434.0s	3434.0	 Each one has to be addressed individually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3435.8s	3435.8	 One of them could be to help people put solar panels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3438.7s	3438.7	 on top of schools and batteries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3440.1s	3440.1	 That could be a good bill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3442.3s	3442.3	 But there definitely needs to be-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3443.6s	3443.6	 We have that mechanism at the federal level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3445.4s	3445.4	 The IRA passed an incredible set of incentives,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3448.1s	3448.1	 both for the producers of these things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3450.2s	3450.2	 and for the end companies that actually deploy them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3453.9s	3453.9	 And so we've solved that problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3456.8s	3456.8	 So I just think like, it just goes to show you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3458.9s	3458.9	 a ton of regulation does not actually add
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3461.9s	3461.9	 and get to the solution that we want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3463.6s	3463.6	 The government will not solve your problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3465.9s	3465.9	 I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3468.2s	3468.2	 but they are going to make things more complicated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3471.3s	3471.3	 and more expensive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3472.9s	3472.9	 and the resilience that you expect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3474.5s	3474.5	 out of your utility infrastructure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3476.1s	3476.1	 By the way, we saw just what happened last week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3478.5s	3478.5	 There was a massive fire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3479.6s	3479.6	 and a massive battery installation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3481.7s	3481.7	 that California installed, 182 gigawatt system,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3485.2s	3485.2	 megawatt system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3486.1s	3486.1	 Could you imagine if that had actually lit on fire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3488.7s	3488.7	 two weeks earlier in the middle of this crazy heat wave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3491.0s	3491.0	 that we had?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3492.6s	3492.6	 So even utility scale renewables
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3495.5s	3495.5	 are very complicated projects to undertake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3498.7s	3498.7	 Look at Texas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3499.5s	3499.5	 I mean, people are dying there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3500.8s	3500.8	 because the grid keeps going down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3502.2s	3502.2	 It is much safer and more reliable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3504.4s	3504.4	 if every homeowner in the United States took responsibility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3508.5s	3508.5	 and used these incentives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3511.4s	3511.4	 to basically become your own little virtual power plant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3513.8s	3513.8	 And you will-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3514.6s	3514.6	 Technology's there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3515.4s	3515.4	 I mean, the technology is-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3516.3s	3516.3	 And people are getting generators
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3517.4s	3517.4	 for natural gases backups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3519.2s	3519.2	 We're going to have to figure out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3520.3s	3520.3	 how to take the load off the grid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3521.7s	3521.7	 and build resiliency into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3522.8s	3522.8	 I don't know if you guys saw in a related story,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3525.4s	3525.4	 all this ESG stuff is kind of coming to a head,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3527.7s	3527.7	 but Dilbert got canceled this week in like 200 newspapers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3531.1s	3531.1	 Did you see this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3532.3s	3532.3	 What?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3533.4s	3533.4	 Yeah. How's that possible?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3534.9s	3534.9	 Well, because he's been going after ESG in his cartoon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3539.0s	3539.0	 And so I'm interested in your take on this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3542.8s	3542.8	 but here are, I don't know the characters in Dilbert
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3545.6s	3545.6	 except for Dilbert, but he says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3547.4s	3547.4	 this person who's in charge says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3548.8s	3548.8	 our ESG score will drop if we open a new factory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3552.1s	3552.1	 that adds CO2 to the atmosphere,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3554.0s	3554.0	 but we can balance that out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3555.0s	3555.0	 by adding more diversity to our board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3557.4s	3557.4	 And I guess the cat says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3558.9s	3558.9	 how much CO2 do you plan to add?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3560.8s	3560.8	 And he said, one non-binary board members were.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3565.2s	3565.2	 Showing the ES and the G being put together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3567.8s	3567.8	 makes no sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3569.9s	3569.9	 But that panel obviously got him canceled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3572.5s	3572.5	 What does it mean he's canceled?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3573.9s	3573.9	 Like he was fired from national newspapers?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3576.2s	3576.2	 I think one of the 177 newspapers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3579.3s	3579.3	 cause they're all part of chains now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3580.6s	3580.6	 And I guess some of those changes are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3582.0s	3582.0	 Because of that cartoon?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3583.6s	3583.6	 That cartoon plus it's like a series
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3585.4s	3585.4	 going after the social governance,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3588.6s	3588.6	 part of environmental and pointing out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3591.5s	3591.5	 He stated on his podcast that he wants to kill ESG.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3594.9s	3594.9	 So this whole ESG debate, he's trying to further it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3598.0s	3598.0	 But I guess that, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3600.5s	3600.5	 I mean, the concept of ESG makes a ton of sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3603.5s	3603.5	 I think the problem is that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3604.6s	3604.6	 It does?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3606.4s	3606.4	 Yeah, this version 1.0 implementation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3608.9s	3608.9	 was financialized by people that have no care
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3611.8s	3611.8	 about ESG at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3613.3s	3613.3	 And so all it's done is create complexity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3615.3s	3615.3	 and consultants and studies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3617.4s	3617.4	 Wait, you said it makes sense or it doesn't make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3619.4s	3619.4	 No, the words.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3621.2s	3621.2	 E, S and G make a lot of sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3623.1s	3623.1	 Should they have commas or periods
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3624.2s	3624.2	 between them, I guess is the question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3625.8s	3625.8	 That's fine too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3626.7s	3626.7	 But my point is saying that you want diversity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3630.8s	3630.8	 and you want sustainability and you want better governance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3633.8s	3633.8	 All good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3634.6s	3634.6	 All of these things are really great ideas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3636.5s	3636.5	 It's just that in this first implementation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3638.4s	3638.4	 it got financially perverted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3641.0s	3641.0	 And so what you have are folks that are probably not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3644.4s	3644.4	 the best positioned or should not really have an opinion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3646.8s	3646.8	 about ESG, opining about things that they never were given
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3650.0s	3650.0	 the authority to opine on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3651.4s	3651.4	 And then as a result, what it's really created
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3653.1s	3653.1	 is a cottage industry of consultants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3655.9s	3655.9	 that can basically make hundreds of millions of dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3659.8s	3659.8	 writing all of these reports.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3662.3s	3662.3	 And I think that that's why this implementation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3665.2s	3665.2	 doesn't work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3666.1s	3666.1	 So ESG today is broken and I think it's largely meaningless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3669.4s	3669.4	 The concept of what people want is a very good idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3672.2s	3672.2	 We just need a better way to implement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3673.7s	3673.7	 I agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3674.6s	3674.6	 You can't connect these things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3676.2s	3676.2	 We're gonna put social and governance with environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3678.9s	3678.9	 It's all that's gonna do is hold back the environment, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3681.0s	3681.0	 Sax, Sax, we're having all of Fed beef tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3683.4s	3683.4	 Oh, this is the greatest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3684.8s	3684.8	 You need to try it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3685.7s	3685.7	 I'll see what I can do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3686.9s	3686.9	 No, you have to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3687.7s	3687.7	 You have to do it, Sax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3688.6s	3688.6	 Once you have to say- Come on, Sax, commit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3690.0s	3690.0	 No bullshit anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3691.4s	3691.4	 Sax, you cannot imagine what does a beef look like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3693.6s	3693.6	 that has been only fed green olives,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3696.0s	3696.0	 pitted green olives at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3697.8s	3697.8	 I can tell you how it looks delicious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3700.3s	3700.3	 Is it green?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3701.4s	3701.4	 It's the most delicious steak you've had in your life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3703.6s	3703.6	 It's the most delicious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3705.2s	3705.2	 All right, I'll come for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3706.7s	3706.7	 It's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3707.6s	3707.6	 Sax, are you gonna drive me with your driver?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3709.7s	3709.7	 Text me your address so I know where to get you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3711.8s	3711.8	 Oh, I love it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3728.1s	3728.1	 No more flips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3729.0s	3729.0	 The flips are ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3729.8s	3729.8	 Okay, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3730.6s	3730.6	 Now that Sax is coming,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3731.7s	3731.7	 I'm gonna tell him to break out the early white truffles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3734.4s	3734.4	 Oh, what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3736.0s	3736.0	 I'm just kidding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3736.8s	3736.8	 You're sending the truffle pigs out?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3738.6s	3738.6	 Nat just walked to my office.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3740.2s	3740.2	 She looked at me when I said white truffle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3741.6s	3741.6	 She's like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3744.4s	3744.4	 For bestie dinner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3745.9s	3745.9	 It's happening, everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3747.2s	3747.2	 Oh, it's happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3748.0s	3748.0	 It's happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3748.8s	3748.8	 You know what I saw was Hellmuth the other day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3751.4s	3751.4	 on one of his heads up matches
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3752.7s	3752.7	 where he got in that huge fight with that guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3754.2s	3754.2	 Did you guys see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3755.1s	3755.1	 And he called the guy over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3755.9s	3755.9	 I think that's every match.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3756.8s	3756.8	 You just described every match he's ever been in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3757.6s	3757.6	 Yeah, this was like some heads up thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3759.7s	3759.7	 And the guy had flopped some insane,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3762.9s	3762.9	 I think it was like quads or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3764.5s	3764.5	 And Hellmuth had like top pair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3766.0s	3766.0	 except the four of his pair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3767.6s	3767.6	 And Hellmuth folded on this guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3769.1s	3769.1	 It was incredible to watch the play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3770.6s	3770.6	 Like the read from Hellmuth was unbelievable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3772.7s	3772.7	 He is incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3773.5s	3773.5	 He's a frigging phenom, that guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3775.0s	3775.0	 He's pretty great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3775.9s	3775.9	 He's got unbelievable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3776.7s	3776.7	 There's a reason he's the greatest poker player
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3778.3s	3778.3	 in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3779.1s	3779.1	 He really, his reads are unbelievable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3781.1s	3781.1	 Do you think that what percentage of it is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3784.1s	3784.1	 obviously he is incredible player,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3786.7s	3786.7	 but there's another piece of this that we all see,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3788.6s	3788.6	 which is people play into him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3790.0s	3790.0	 They want to be in a hand with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3791.5s	3791.5	 They want to bust him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3793.2s	3793.2	 So in those tournaments, what do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3795.5s	3795.5	 No, I think what's happening is at the highest level,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3797.9s	3797.9	 there's like all these people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3799.3s	3799.3	 that have gone in this one direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3801.4s	3801.4	 And by the way, this is probably a good,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3803.0s	3803.0	 we could talk about chess in the same way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3805.2s	3805.2	 which is that you have these solvers, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3807.0s	3807.0	 There's poker solvers and now there are these chess solvers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3810.3s	3810.3	 and the young generation spends all this time training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3813.0s	3813.0	 on the solvers so that they know every permutation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3816.1s	3816.1	 of every move and what is what people call
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3818.4s	3818.4	 game theory optimal or GTO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3820.9s	3820.9	 The problem with GTO is that you can actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3823.1s	3823.1	 be very exploitative against somebody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3825.6s	3825.6	 that's actually playing perfectly because the AI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3829.4s	3829.4	 is perfected around what is the rational set
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3831.5s	3831.5	 of decisions in every spot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3833.0s	3833.0	 And so you can set people up to make a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3835.0s	3835.0	 of really bad mistakes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3836.2s	3836.2	 And I think Helmuth understands that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3838.3s	3838.3	 And so because he is one of like this dying breed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3841.3s	3841.3	 of people that plays live,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3843.7s	3843.7	 he's able to just be so exploitative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3846.2s	3846.2	 And these folks that are basically playing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3848.5s	3848.5	 from rote memory, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3851.1s	3851.1	 What is the GTO move in every spot?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3853.0s	3853.0	 They end up making a bunch of mistakes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3854.8s	3854.8	 and feeding chips into him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3858.4s	3858.4	 And so I think like it's probably the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3860.8s	3860.8	 as sort of this Magnus Carlsen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3862.5s	3862.5	 He kind of knew what to expect from people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3865.4s	3865.4	 And the minute this get deviated into this realm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3867.6s	3867.6	 where you were like, how could you make that decision?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3871.0s	3871.0	 Probably because the computer AI is able to calculate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3874.8s	3874.8	 make a slightly losing move now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3876.8s	3876.8	 three moves later, you're gonna actually be ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3879.6s	3879.6	 It caught him off guard where he was basically like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3881.5s	3881.5	 I think this guy's cheating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3884.0s	3884.0	 Really, really crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3884.9s	3884.9	 But I think like if you have a bunch of GTO kids,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3889.1s	3889.1	 folks that are a little bit older
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3890.8s	3890.8	 that have been playing in a live situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3892.4s	3892.4	 can be hyper exploitative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3894.4s	3894.4	 By the way, this is a good point generally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3896.2s	3896.2	 about this gaming is that computation has played
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3899.6s	3899.6	 and computers have played such an incredible role.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3902.4s	3902.4	 It almost becomes questionable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3904.6s	3904.6	 on how much can the human really differentiate anymore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3908.5s	3908.5	 in these games and in these systems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3911.8s	3911.8	 You guys watch the chess players on YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3914.2s	3914.2	 and they'll have solvers live
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3916.1s	3916.1	 and they'll be getting live scoring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3917.5s	3917.5	 as they kind of walk through a match
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3919.2s	3919.2	 or walk through a scenario.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3920.1s	3920.1	 By the way, Freebird, that's the same with poker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3922.6s	3922.6	 You have these HUDs, these heads up displays
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3925.5s	3925.5	 and a lot of the poker sites have basically given up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3927.8s	3927.8	 They try to spot the cheating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3929.9s	3929.9	 and because you have this basically layer that's helping you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3933.9s	3933.9	 and it's effectively impossible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3935.3s	3935.3	 because these things run locally,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3938.0s	3938.0	 they're screen scraping locally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3939.8s	3939.8	 and you just have no idea except when they make moves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3942.8s	3942.8	 that are just so unpredictable from a human
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3945.6s	3945.6	 and could only come from a machine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3948.0s	3948.0	 Ultimately, all games maybe become obsolete
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3951.3s	3951.3	 because there is no real way to qualify the performance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3955.3s	3955.3	 of one human against another when the AI itself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3958.2s	3958.2	 or the technology or the computing itself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3960.3s	3960.3	 overshadows human potential and human capability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3962.9s	3962.9	 You guys may not know this story,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3964.2s	3964.2	 but when I met Demis, the founder of DeepMind,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3969.3s	3969.3	 I got introduced by Teal in 2011 or 12,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3972.6s	3972.6	 so like a decade ago and I met him in London.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3975.5s	3975.5	 I'll never forget this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3977.2s	3977.2	 We were having breakfast at the Conant Hotel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3979.8s	3979.8	 and he explained to me DeepMind in the context of a game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3982.8s	3982.8	 because at that time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3984.1s	3984.1	 how they were building the first versions of the AI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3988.1s	3988.1	 was perfecting how to play certain video games
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3990.0s	3990.0	 and I can't remember the name of the video game,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3991.6s	3991.6	 but it was one of the famous first person shooter games
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3994.6s	3994.6	 and the whole idea there was like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3996.4s	3996.4	 if you can perfect an AI that basically plays GTO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=3999.1s	3999.1	 and can win the game,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4000.2s	4000.2	 what you've effectively solved for is like a layer of AI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4003.9s	4003.9	 that can then solve other generalized problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4006.1s	4006.1	 I was blown away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4007.2s	4007.2	 I thought this is the craziest thing I've ever heard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4009.2s	4009.2	 a decade ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4011.2s	4011.2	 So it's pretty natural that they've taken this stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4013.5s	4013.5	 and adapted it to meet every game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4015.8s	4015.8	 It's a little sad though too, no?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4017.3s	4017.3	 Don't you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4018.2s	4018.2	 Yeah, I mean, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4019.0s	4019.0	 But I mean, maybe there's a different model of performance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4022.2s	4022.2	 for humans that really changes what the gaming is, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4025.5s	4025.5	 Well, augmented.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4027.6s	4027.6	 I don't know what it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4028.6s	4028.6	 I mean, I think that these games themselves completely,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4032.6s	4032.6	 you know, the intent of a game,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4035.1s	4035.1	 which is to measure one's kind of decision-making abilities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4038.4s	4038.4	 gets obsolete because the software ultimately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4040.7s	4040.7	 is a better decision-maker than the human.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4042.8s	4042.8	 So the question then is what is the human going to rise to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4046.9s	4046.9	 that creates a new playing field?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4049.2s	4049.2	 And I think there's probably elements of creativity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4051.8s	4051.8	 and actually using the software to become part of the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4054.5s	4054.5	 It opens up a whole new opportunity for what gaming is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4057.6s	4057.6	 I mean, we've been talking a little bit about video games,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4059.8s	4059.8	 but you could see artificial constructs in gaming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4062.5s	4062.5	 that arise from the human interacting with the computer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4065.3s	4065.3	 and then creating a new sort of playing field in gaming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4068.1s	4068.1	 Sax, what do you think about all this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4069.6s	4069.6	 You're a big chess player.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4071.1s	4071.1	 Yeah, I've been following it for the last couple of weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4073.2s	4073.2	 It's obviously been the big story in the chess world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4076.0s	4076.0	 What basically happened is that a couple of weeks ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4080.0s	4080.0	 Magnus Carlsen lost that game to Hans,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4084.2s	4084.2	 what's his last name?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4085.1s	4085.1	 Niemann, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4085.9s	4085.9	 Niemann, yeah, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4087.5s	4087.5	 And the next day he pulled out of the tournament.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4090.2s	4090.2	 This is the Sinkfield Cup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4091.8s	4091.8	 And he's never pulled out of a tournament before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4093.8s	4093.8	 Everyone was sort of speculating, is he sick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4095.8s	4095.8	 or have COVID or something like that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4097.0s	4097.0	 And then he tweeted out a video from some soccer coach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4102.2s	4102.2	 saying, I can't talk about it, I'll get in trouble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4104.0s	4104.0	 Yeah, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4105.4s	4105.4	 So clearly he was in a passive aggressive way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4108.9s	4108.9	 of making an accusation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4110.2s	4110.2	 And then he doubled down a few days ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4112.4s	4112.4	 He was in another tournament and he had to play Hans,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4117.6s	4117.6	 I keep forgetting the guy's name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4119.2s	4119.2	 Hans Niemann.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4120.0s	4120.0	 Niemann, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4122.4s	4122.4	 He had to play him and he resigned on move two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4123.6s	4123.6	 So basically he doubled down in his accusation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4126.1s	4126.1	 And he won't specifically say what leads him to believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4129.4s	4129.4	 that this guy is cheating, but he thinks he is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4133.8s	4133.8	 He's a young player, he's something like 18.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4137.4s	4137.4	 And he's had a pretty meteoric rise in the chess world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4141.3s	4141.3	 I think his rating has gone up a couple hundred points
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4143.8s	4143.8	 over the last two years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4145.4s	4145.4	 It's the fastest rise in chess rating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4148.3s	4148.3	 that anyone's ever had before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4151.1s	4151.1	 It's been the case that players have,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4154.2s	4154.2	 and young players especially have risen quickly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4156.6s	4156.6	 but this is, it's a pretty, it's the biggest rise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4160.5s	4160.5	 How is he cheating?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4161.3s	4161.3	 That's happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4162.2s	4162.2	 Well, that's the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4163.0s	4163.0	 So the issue is that it's easy to cheat in online chess,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4168.8s	4168.8	 but in over the board, you would either need to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4171.9s	4171.9	 a device or to be signaled by somebody in the crowd.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4175.8s	4175.8	 You'd need human assistance or the assistance of a device.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4179.2s	4179.2	 It'd almost be like a casino or something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4181.8s	4181.8	 where they're using the contraption on the guy's leg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4184.8s	4184.8	 to signal information to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4187.6s	4187.6	 So nobody really knows how he would have done it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4191.6s	4191.6	 And of course he wasn't caught doing it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4193.8s	4193.8	 so he can never prove that he wasn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4197.3s	4197.3	 So there's just a real question here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4198.9s	4198.9	 But they did make some changes after Magnus Carlsen resigned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4203.3s	4203.3	 They put the feed on a 15 minute delay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4207.6s	4207.6	 I think at some point you're gonna have to start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4210.3s	4210.3	 wandering people and having them go through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4212.0s	4212.0	 a metal detector.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4213.7s	4213.7	 Yeah, they're gonna have to toughen up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4215.0s	4215.0	 all of the anti-cheating standards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4217.6s	4217.6	 One of the grandmasters was like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4219.0s	4219.0	 we should play naked in a locker room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4221.0s	4221.0	 Yeah, there was an online site that basically offered
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4225.2s	4225.2	 to pay Niemann a lot of money to play basically naked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4228.8s	4228.8	 to prove that he could really do what he's been doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4233.1s	4233.1	 The theory on why he's not cheating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4236.8s	4236.8	 and the rise is justified is that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4240.6s	4240.6	 in theory, this is the argument is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4242.8s	4242.8	 he's grown up learning from all these neural nets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4246.7s	4246.7	 these not just chess engines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4248.6s	4248.6	 The first generation of chess engines were like stockfish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4251.7s	4251.7	 They were just computational machines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4253.9s	4253.9	 that were programmed by humans with thousands of rules
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4256.9s	4256.9	 on how to play chess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4258.2s	4258.2	 And then they could just crunch the lines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4260.1s	4260.1	 better than a human could.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4261.3s	4261.3	 More recently, thanks to DeepMind,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4263.9s	4263.9	 it's a whole different type of machine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4265.7s	4265.7	 It's basically these neural networks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4267.6s	4267.6	 where all they're programmed with are the rules of chess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4271.1s	4271.1	 And then it plays thousands of games
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4273.5s	4273.5	 or millions of games against itself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4275.7s	4275.7	 and it learns the best way to play chess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4278.3s	4278.3	 And the neural nets play in a whole different way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4281.9s	4281.9	 than the stockfish, than the pure engines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4285.5s	4285.5	 The engines is played like a human
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4287.3s	4287.3	 that's able to calculate really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4289.1s	4289.1	 Whereas the neural nets do things like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4293.7s	4293.7	 they're sacrifices that a human would never make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4296.3s	4296.3	 Yeah, they'll make sacrifices just for peace activity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4299.3s	4299.3	 So, normally when a human makes a sacrifice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4302.2s	4302.2	 they'll recapture the material within a few moves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4305.2s	4305.2	 Whereas DeepMind will sacrifice a pawn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4308.9s	4308.9	 and just for the positional advantage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4311.6s	4311.6	 or for the increase in peace activity against-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4313.2s	4313.2	 Which doesn't show up for many, many moves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4315.2s	4315.2	 Right, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4316.2s	4316.2	 It's exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4317.3s	4317.3	 And so the ability to model 12 moves out is really-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4320.3s	4320.3	 But that's where I think people thought
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4322.4s	4322.4	 that Magnus picked up on something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4324.1s	4324.1	 because it's like those sorts of moves are rare
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4327.1s	4327.1	 in the absence of some layer of intervention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4329.3s	4329.3	 Because typically it's like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4331.0s	4331.0	 and Sax, you know this much better than I,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4332.5s	4332.5	 but it's like the opening and the closings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4335.2s	4335.2	 of all of these chess matches are tightly regulated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4337.5s	4337.5	 There's not a lot of creativity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4338.8s	4338.8	 It's sort of in the mid game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4341.0s	4341.0	 that you have these slight positional advantages
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4343.0s	4343.0	 and disadvantages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4343.8s	4343.8	 And so I think it was amplified
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4346.2s	4346.2	 that one of these positional sacrifices
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4347.8s	4347.8	 made no sense in the context of that game,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4349.7s	4349.7	 unless you had the ability to think really conclusively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4353.6s	4353.6	 about six, seven moves from now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4355.4s	4355.4	 By the way, it's the same thing in poker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4357.5s	4357.5	 So there's a thing, if you guys wanna download it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4359.4s	4359.4	 it's called, I think it's called Poker Snowy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4361.9s	4361.9	 That was like the first layer of a pretty basic AI,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4365.0s	4365.0	 but it's gotten better and better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4366.4s	4366.4	 And really what it allows you to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4367.7s	4367.7	 is in every situational spot,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4370.0s	4370.0	 whether it's heads up all the way to a six-handed ring game,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4373.3s	4373.3	 you can really understand what to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4376.7s	4376.7	 Now poker is meaningfully more complicated than chess,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4380.6s	4380.6	 as it turns out, because again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4382.5s	4382.5	 you're not playing against one player,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4383.9s	4383.9	 you're playing against some umpteen number of players.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4386.4s	4386.4	 We don't know when each of them is gonna step into a pot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4388.5s	4388.5	 or step out of a pot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4390.0s	4390.0	 And then there's all of those elements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4391.9s	4391.9	 So it's a little bit more complicated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4393.6s	4393.6	 to build a true kind of like neural net around it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4396.1s	4396.1	 But even still, you can kind of get a sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4398.5s	4398.5	 of what you should be doing in different spots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4401.1s	4401.1	 And what you see is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4403.0s	4403.0	 there's literally like trillions of actions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4406.2s	4406.2	 And so it really is impossible for a human being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4409.6s	4409.6	 to really memorize in every single situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4413.6s	4413.6	 what the true probabilistically weighted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4416.8s	4416.8	 GTO optimized move is gonna be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4419.0s	4419.0	 And so this is why I think a lot of people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4421.6s	4421.6	 I guess led by Magnus was saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4423.8s	4423.8	 how could you have known this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4424.9s	4424.9	 unless you were aided by something?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4427.4s	4427.4	 It's pretty clear that this guy cheated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4429.6s	4429.6	 I think what's profound is that mastery of the game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4433.2s	4433.2	 may not be achievable by a human,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4435.4s	4435.4	 but mastery of any one of these games
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4437.0s	4437.0	 may actually be achievable by neural nets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4439.6s	4439.6	 And I think that's what's really frustrating to Magnus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4442.6s	4442.6	 and to other top tier players in the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4444.7s	4444.7	 that are the best humans at a particular game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4447.1s	4447.1	 is they're now realizing that they really aren't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4451.0s	4451.0	 the true masters, that the true masters are the neural nets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4454.1s	4454.1	 And more than just the guy cheating,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4455.7s	4455.7	 which may feel like bad sportsmanship or whatever,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4458.8s	4458.8	 fundamentally one's ego being built entirely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4461.4s	4461.4	 on one's mastery of the game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4462.8s	4462.8	 and being the best at the game is fundamentally challenged,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4465.4s	4465.4	 because a computer is better at the game than you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4468.6s	4468.6	 It's a really profound moment for humans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4470.4s	4470.4	 That shouldn't be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4471.4s	4471.4	 I think that ship sailed a long time ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4473.4s	4473.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4474.2s	4474.2	 I mean, I know the chess work very well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4475.0s	4475.0	 But he's experiencing it, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4475.9s	4475.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4476.7s	4476.7	 Well, no, it was, so it was way back when,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4479.1s	4479.1	 remember when Kasparov played Deep Blue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4481.8s	4481.8	 which is the IBM?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4483.2s	4483.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4484.0s	4484.0	 That was the first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4484.8s	4484.8	 Which wasn't even a sophisticated neural net.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4486.0s	4486.0	 That was just a almost deterministically modeled,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4488.6s	4488.6	 yeah, it was a deterministically modeled system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4490.2s	4490.2	 It was like Stockfish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4491.1s	4491.1	 It was just a number cruncher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4492.5s	4492.5	 And that was when computer intelligence and chess tipped
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4497.1s	4497.1	 to be able to beat the world champion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4499.0s	4499.0	 Since then, there's no looking back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4500.6s	4500.6	 I think every human who plays in the chess world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4504.0s	4504.0	 understands that computers are better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4505.9s	4505.9	 and there's no way for a human to be better than a computer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4509.2s	4509.2	 So, and certainly not a neural net.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4512.0s	4512.0	 I mean, Magnus certainly knows that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4513.4s	4513.4	 I don't think anyone's bothered by that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4514.8s	4514.8	 I think that everyone understands that humans play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4517.4s	4517.4	 in a certain way and their goal is to be the best human.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4521.2s	4521.2	 I think the concern is just obviously if a human,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4523.8s	4523.8	 it gets aided during a game by computers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4526.8s	4526.8	 But the way that chess works now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4530.4s	4530.4	 the preparation is all about working with computers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4533.2s	4533.2	 These top players spend huge amounts of time researching
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4536.8s	4536.8	 openings and looking for novelties in openings,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4540.0s	4540.0	 using computers to help them do their research.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4543.0s	4543.0	 So, you know, working with computers has now become
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4546.0s	4546.0	 an integral part of the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4547.1s	4547.1	 It's kind of like, you know, in many sports
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4549.6s	4549.6	 where the technology has enabled the athlete to get better,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4553.4s	4553.4	 you know, and it's really technology becomes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4556.4s	4556.4	 the key vector of competition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4557.8s	4557.8	 This actually happened in the NBA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4559.7s	4559.7	 This happened in the NBA where there's a special technology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4562.6s	4562.6	 for three-point shooting and your form, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4565.4s	4565.4	 And the Knicks actually, and a couple of other teams
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4568.0s	4568.0	 implemented it a couple of years ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4569.4s	4569.4	 and you saw the entire team became better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4571.9s	4571.9	 at three-point shooting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4573.0s	4573.0	 So, people who were, you know, 200%, 300%,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4575.6s	4575.6	 you know, moved up 10, 20% each.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4577.8s	4577.8	 But this kid is clearly cheating because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4580.5s	4580.5	 he's cheated in the past and people who cheat in the past
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4582.4s	4582.4	 cheat in the future is my basic belief.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4584.4s	4584.4	 So, this guy Neiman publicly admitted that he'd used
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4587.0s	4587.0	 electronic devices to cheat when he was just a kid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4589.2s	4589.2	 on online games when he was 12 to 16 years old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4591.8s	4591.8	 So, then the question is like, no, but Jason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4593.7s	4593.7	 it's worse than that, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4594.6s	4594.6	 because then chess.com came out and said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4596.4s	4596.4	 actually the cheating was more rampant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4598.9s	4598.9	 than just those two incidents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4600.4s	4600.4	 Their algorithm determined it, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4602.0s	4602.0	 Yeah, he's definitely cheating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4603.4s	4603.4	 So, why are people playing with him?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4605.8s	4605.8	 Well, because he said that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4608.9s	4608.9	 he said that was, those games were not for money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4611.8s	4611.8	 and he was just rampant, he was rating fast,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4615.0s	4615.0	 and he was a kid or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4615.8s	4615.8	 It's like the poker guys who cheat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4617.4s	4617.4	 If you're a poker guy and you've cheated before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4619.0s	4619.0	 you never play with those players again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4620.8s	4620.8	 They're cheaters, it's obvious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4621.8s	4621.8	 And they can just-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4622.9s	4622.9	 Well, the issue here is that this was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4624.6s	4624.6	 an over-the-board tournament where,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4627.2s	4627.2	 the one that Magnus pulled out of in order to protest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4629.9s	4629.9	 So, the question is, how could he have been cheating?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4633.2s	4633.2	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4634.2s	4634.2	 Now, I think what adds to the complexity of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4636.8s	4636.8	 is that you have to remember
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4637.8s	4637.8	 that when you're dealing with a player,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4639.5s	4639.5	 look, if it was us playing Magnus,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4641.4s	4641.4	 we'd need to cheat on every single move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4643.1s	4643.1	 But if you're a 26 or 2700 player,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4647.0s	4647.0	 and Magnus is a 2860 or something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4649.8s	4649.8	 the higher the rating, the better in chess,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4651.1s	4651.1	 it's called the ELO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4653.0s	4653.0	 But in any event, if you're like a 26, 2700 player
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4655.9s	4655.9	 like Niemann, you only need help
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4658.7s	4658.7	 with a few moves in the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4660.6s	4660.6	 In other words, if you could get a tip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4663.0s	4663.0	 at a critical moment of the game,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4665.0s	4665.0	 that might be all you need to put you over the top.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4667.2s	4667.2	 You wouldn't need to, in other words, to beat Magnus,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4669.1s	4669.1	 you wouldn't need to cheat on every move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4671.4s	4671.4	 If you just cheat on two or three moves at the right time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4674.9s	4674.9	 that could put you over the top.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4676.6s	4676.6	 So, something could vibrate on your leg four times,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4680.9s	4680.9	 and then two times over to tell you which piece to move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4683.3s	4683.3	 That's what they were saying, Jake,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4684.3s	4684.3	 how like he had like a vibrator in his foot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4687.0s	4687.0	 Where was the vibrator?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4688.5s	4688.5	 In his shoe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4689.6s	4689.6	 There was a meme that became like a whole thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4691.4s	4691.4	 where it was like he had something in his butt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4692.9s	4692.9	 or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4693.7s	4693.7	 An anal chest computer is what you're saying?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4697.3s	4697.3	 Okay, no, look, that's not real.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4698.9s	4698.9	 Somebody speculated on Reddit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4700.8s	4700.8	 Yeah, and then it became a meme.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4701.6s	4701.6	 Somebody did a Reddit post saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4703.1s	4703.1	 that he was being communicated with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4705.6s	4705.6	 through vibrating anal beads, and then that went viral.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4709.2s	4709.2	 Elon tweeted it, although I think he deleted it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4711.8s	4711.8	 Look, it's absurd, but the point is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4715.0s	4715.0	 there is a question of how would he have done it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4717.1s	4717.1	 if he did it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4718.9s	4718.9	 And there have been cases before though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4720.8s	4720.8	 of people getting caught.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4722.3s	4722.3	 Yeah, people getting caught going to the bathroom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4724.0s	4724.0	 and then checking their phone or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4725.9s	4725.9	 There was a Bulgarian grandmaster,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4727.5s	4727.5	 he got caught in the bathroom checking his phone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4730.0s	4730.0	 Oh God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4730.9s	4730.9	 Metal detectors on the way in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4732.2s	4732.2	 and they have RF detectors in the room, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4734.4s	4734.4	 So they look for any sort of communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4736.7s	4736.7	 I think they did, remember that going into this event?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4739.6s	4739.6	 You just could have nobody watching live.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4741.1s	4741.1	 No, they did it after a madness quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4742.0s	4742.0	 Make it a half hour delay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4743.3s	4743.3	 The Stinkfield Cup added a 15 minute delay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4745.7s	4745.7	 after these accusations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4747.6s	4747.6	 So yeah, I think there's gonna be more precautions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4751.6s	4751.6	 basically, but we still haven't heard from Magnus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4754.1s	4754.1	 what made him think that there was foul play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4756.9s	4756.9	 here in this particular game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4757.8s	4757.8	 And he's been very reluctant to, he won't say anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4760.0s	4760.0	 It's sort of passive aggressive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4762.6s	4762.6	 Now the full side of it is that Magnus Carlsen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4765.2s	4765.2	 has been the number one player in chess for over a decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4768.1s	4768.1	 And he's a very classy player.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4770.4s	4770.4	 I mean, I have, you know, everyone's never heard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4773.2s	4773.2	 a word said about him that, you know, was,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4775.2s	4775.2	 now he can be cocky, he can definitely be cocky,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4777.6s	4777.6	 but he's a very classy player.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4779.9s	4779.9	 So I just don't see him doing something like this lightly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4783.5s	4783.5	 So that's what's so-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4785.4s	4785.4	 Dramatic about this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4786.3s	4786.3	 Hard to understand about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4787.2s	4787.2	 Dramatic is yeah, it's really hard to understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4789.5s	4789.5	 how Niemann could have cheated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4791.6s	4791.6	 but also Magnus doesn't seem like the kind of player
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4794.0s	4794.0	 to just make a wild impulsive allegation.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4798.2s	4798.2	 has just been really roiled by this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4800.4s	4800.4	 Is there like any kind of equivalent of like PED scandal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4803.8s	4803.8	 here, like people taking Adderall or Provisial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4807.1s	4807.1	 or any other kind of nootropics to get an edge?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4811.0s	4811.0	 No, no one's ever said that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4812.8s	4812.8	 There's a good documentary, I think it was on Vice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4814.9s	4814.9	 on how a lot of the top chess players
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4816.8s	4816.8	 actually get ready for matches.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4818.8s	4818.8	 And they're incredibly diligent about their sleep,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4821.8s	4821.8	 their workout routine, alcohol, they do take supplements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4825.0s	4825.0	 I forgot who made the documentary,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4826.2s	4826.2	 but it's actually incredibly intense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4827.8s	4827.8	 how physical these people are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4830.2s	4830.2	 Well, like one game of classical chess can burn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4832.2s	4832.2	 like over 2000 calories or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4834.7s	4834.7	 Like the amount of calories that get burned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4837.8s	4837.8	 just by using your brain so intensely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4840.5s	4840.5	 Adderall is rampant in the poker community,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4843.3s	4843.3	 especially in tournaments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4844.5s	4844.5	 So when you play the higher tournaments and I played them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4847.2s	4847.2	 and I just kind of step in and it's,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4850.6s	4850.6	 I felt very underpowered relative to the kids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4853.2s	4853.2	 I was playing with, because they were all on Adderall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4855.2s	4855.2	 Well, these are 12 hours,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4856.5s	4856.5	 well, it's 10 hour sessions over 12 hours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4858.0s	4858.0	 10 hour sessions, it's exhausting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4860.0s	4860.0	 It's really, really physically exhausting to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4862.1s	4862.1	 That's why I stopped playing tournaments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4863.3s	4863.3	 about a decade ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4864.2s	4864.2	 I just couldn't sit there for that long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4866.1s	4866.1	 It's-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4867.0s	4867.0	 You can't justify the time suck of it too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4868.7s	4868.7	 It's just so physically and emotionally demanding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4873.6s	4873.6	 to be able to play that well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4875.0s	4875.0	 and make no mistakes over 10 hours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4878.0s	4878.0	 And so, the only solution that all these kids would turn to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4880.6s	4880.6	 was Adderall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4882.6s	4882.6	 And I was like, this is not worth it for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4884.0s	4884.0	 So I stopped playing in tournaments,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4885.8s	4885.8	 and which was too bad because I thought like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4887.8s	4887.8	 I could have a real chance of actually doing reasonably well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4889.8s	4889.8	 in some of these things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4890.6s	4890.6	 And I just gave up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4891.4s	4891.4	 By the way, the other thing I wanted to mention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4893.1s	4893.1	 is there's been like cheating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4894.4s	4894.4	 in all these other kinds of sports
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4895.8s	4895.8	 and it always gets exposed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4897.1s	4897.1	 Like whether it's the Tour de France,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4899.6s	4899.6	 it turned out that everybody was using PEDs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4901.8s	4901.8	 or the Russian Olympic team, everybody was using PEDs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4918.5s	4918.5	 to try to stop these protests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4919.9s	4919.9	 The protests started after the death

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4929.7s	4929.7	 for allegedly wearing a hijab head scarf
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4932.4s	4932.4	 in an improper way.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4938.2s	4938.2	 And activists are saying she suffered a fatal blow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4940.7s	4940.7	 to her head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4943.3s	4943.3	 And now you have 15 cities with very large crowds.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4961.0s	4961.0	 Thoughts on this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4962.1s	4962.1	 It's horrible.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcGwHworAo0&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=25&t=4976.0s	4976.0	 Cause we're not the ones behind it.
