https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=63.2s	63.2	 I will never ever, ever moderate this thing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=102.3s	102.3	 And of course, he'll throw in the world's greatest moderator, Jason Calcantes, in the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=126.9s	126.9	 How much did that intro cost?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=127.9s	127.9	 Does it come with the money back refund?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=139.8s	139.8	 The funniest part was when you almost read aloud, it's like you were like, and then David

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=148.4s	148.4	 It's an intro.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=149.4s	149.4	 It's an intro.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=150.4s	150.4	 I'm so glad we do an unscripted show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=151.4s	151.4	 Okay, go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=152.4s	152.4	 Friedberg, I remember when you did the intro.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=153.4s	153.4	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=154.4s	154.4	 Did I read?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=155.4s	155.4	 Actually, didn't we cut it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=156.4s	156.4	 Yeah, you read and then you cut it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=157.4s	157.4	 You hated it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=158.4s	158.4	 And then we made you put it back in or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=159.4s	159.4	 I'm sorry.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=164.9s	164.9	 All I have to say to him about this job security is here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=168.0s	168.0	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=169.0s	169.0	 Okay, issue one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=171.0s	171.0	 Issue one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=172.0s	172.0	 Google breakup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=173.0s	173.0	 The Justice Department and eight states are now seeking to break up Google's business,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=178.2s	178.2	 brokering digital advertising across the internet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=180.8s	180.8	 This is one of the most important legal challenges the companies ever faced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=184.5s	184.5	 Fought a lawsuit on Tuesday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=186.2s	186.2	 The Justice Department did alleging that Google abuses its role as one of the largest broker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=190.5s	190.5	 suppliers and online auctioneers of ads placed on websites and mobile applications.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=195.5s	195.5	 The filing promises a protracted court battle with huge implications for the digital advertising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=200.1s	200.1	 industry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=201.1s	201.1	 Of course, Google responded to the lawsuit in a blog post saying that the DOJ's request
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=207.3s	207.3	 for it to unwind two previous acquisitions from a decade ago is an attempt to rewrite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=211.1s	211.1	 history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=212.3s	212.3	 They said the DOJ mischaracterizes how its advertising products work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=216.0s	216.0	 They say that people choose to use Google because they're effective and the company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=221.5s	221.5	 highlights other companies making moves in the advertising industry as well, such as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=225.9s	225.9	 Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and TikTok.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=228.0s	228.0	 So I guess I'll kick it to you, Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=230.4s	230.4	 Do you think the DOJ has a case here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=232.8s	232.8	 Do you believe that Google has a monopoly in online advertising and is unfairly using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=238.3s	238.3	 it to gain market share?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=239.9s	239.9	 And is this the right remedy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=241.5s	241.5	 Breaking up the company?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=243.1s	243.1	 Yeah, I think that this is a totally ill-founded lawsuit and I think it just shows more of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=250.8s	250.8	 the personal enmity and anger that some people in the US government has towards entrepreneurs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=256.3s	256.3	 and entrepreneurship than anything else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=258.5s	258.5	 Now why is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=261.6s	261.6	 Let's just think about what a monopoly is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=263.7s	263.7	 A monopoly or a monopolist effectively creates a completely stagnant, non-vibrant market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=270.5s	270.5	 in which they have pricing power and complete control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=274.5s	274.5	 Now the argument that I think that refutes that just on its face is if you actually look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=280.6s	280.6	 number one, at their share and number two, how the rest of the share has changed over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=284.9s	284.9	 time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=285.9s	285.9	 So Nick, can you just please throw that up from Bloomberg?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=287.3s	287.3	 This is just in a Bloomberg article that I just shared with you guys, but Google controls
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=291.8s	291.8	 26.5% of a market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=295.0s	295.0	 43.4% of that market is with a diverse group of others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=300.3s	300.3	 Amazon has 18.4% and Amazon has 11.7%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=304.4s	304.4	 This is not the type of pie chart you would see if you had a monopolist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=310.0s	310.0	 So for example, if you went back to the big, big, big monopolist case in the 1980s, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=314.5s	314.5	 is when we broke up Ma Bell, well, what that circle would have shown is that they basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=319.8s	319.8	 had effectively 100% share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=322.9s	322.9	 And what this shows is that there's a huge diversity of people in this market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=326.6s	326.6	 The second thing is that if you had done this chart many years ago, Amazon would not have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=332.0s	332.0	 really even been there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=333.7s	333.7	 And over the last five years, they represent almost 12% of the entire market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=338.4s	338.4	 And it means that if you forecast it forward, they could be at 15 to 20% in a few years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=343.6s	343.6	 as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=344.6s	344.6	 So while the pie is growing, and definitely Google takes a lot of the profit dollars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=349.8s	349.8	 the distribution is so much more than what anything looks like in a monopoly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=354.3s	354.3	 So I just think it means that the DOJ is more focused on trying to punish these great American
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=359.7s	359.7	 companies than it is in trying to be logical and reasoned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=363.6s	363.6	 And so I don't think this is going to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=365.7s	365.7	 The last thing I'll say about this is that if you think about what you should have done,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=370.8s	370.8	 if I were the US government, I would have actually focused on search, because search
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=376.4s	376.4	 is a monopoly for Google.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=379.3s	379.3	 And while Google would try to argue that there are other ways of acquiring information, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=385.1s	385.1	 is really not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=387.1s	387.1	 And if you could prove that that monopoly then led to pricing power in ads, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=392.1s	392.1	 that's a much more nuanced but logical argument that could work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=396.3s	396.3	 But by focusing on this, I think it's going to get deconstructed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=398.8s	398.8	 It's going to fail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=399.8s	399.8	 The Texas version of this exact lawsuit already was thrown out of federal court.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=404.5s	404.5	 So I think that judges and the legal system don't have a lot of patience for this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=409.6s	409.6	 It just meant more to kind of scare American companies and try to play bogeyman and decision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=415.1s	415.1	 maker and I don't think it's going to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=416.7s	416.7	 Freerag, let me go to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=418.0s	418.0	 I think Tramoth raises a really great point that if you define the market as digital advertising,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=424.4s	424.4	 Google's market share is only about a quarter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=425.9s	425.9	 That doesn't seem like a monopoly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=427.5s	427.5	 However, what the government says is that you shouldn't look at digital advertising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=431.9s	431.9	 as a whole, but rather the sort of brokered advertising that Google does for third party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=438.1s	438.1	 websites and applications.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=439.5s	439.5	 Let me show a chart from their lawsuit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=443.2s	443.2	 You can see here that the way they define it, again, they see it as this brokering of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=449.6s	449.6	 sell-side inventory, which are website publishers, and then buy-side demand, which are advertisers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=455.4s	455.4	 In this way, it looks like Google has 90% or more market share on the sell side because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=462.2s	462.2	 the double-click acquisition, they've got somewhere between 40 and 80% market share
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=467.0s	467.0	 on the demand side with advertisers, and then in the middle, they have over 50% market share
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=471.7s	471.7	 of the ad exchange.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=473.1s	473.1	 Is this the right way to look at Google's business or should we be just thinking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=479.4s	479.4	 in terms of the overall digital advertising market?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=483.3s	483.3	 I've been involved in ad networks since about 2002.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=488.0s	488.0	 Obviously, I'm not directly involved in the business anymore, but I was pretty close to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=494.0s	494.0	 this and I was pretty close to double-click in the acquisition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=497.1s	497.1	 I was a business product manager for a period of time on AdWords.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=501.3s	501.3	 The way that chart shows the connection between advertisers and publishers is correct that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=508.9s	508.9	 an ad network, generally speaking, brings buyers of ad inventory to the sellers of ad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=515.1s	515.1	 inventory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=516.7s	516.7	 The sellers of ad inventory have the option to sell their inventory on an ad network.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=522.4s	522.4	 If the money that they're making on those ad slots that they have, whether it's a slot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=526.5s	526.5	 on the side of a page or the top of a page or an interstitial video ad, whatever it is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=530.9s	530.9	 they're going to keep selling their inventory through that network if they're getting paid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=535.3s	535.3	 the most.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=536.5s	536.5	 The real reason Google has won is two-part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=539.0s	539.0	 One is because they ran their ad network as an auction, meaning advertisers were competing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=544.2s	544.2	 with each other to pay the most for an ad spot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=547.3s	547.3	 That was the highest quality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=548.3s	548.3	 There's also an ad quality index calculation, a click-through index, a bounce-back index.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=553.6s	553.6	 There's all this data that feeds into Google's ad network auction so that the ad that's shown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=559.5s	559.5	 on the publisher site is not just the best ad for the publisher, but the best ad for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=563.4s	563.4	 the consumer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=564.5s	564.5	 Then when the consumer clicks on the ad, the publisher gets paid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=567.9s	567.9	 The second thing that Google did, and so the auction dynamic is a really powerful dynamic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=572.6s	572.6	 It creates the best price for the publisher and it creates the highest quality ad for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=577.8s	577.8	 the user, which translates typically into higher click-throughs and better revenue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=584.0s	584.0	 What they also did that was really powerful is they did the highest revenue share in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=588.2s	588.2	 market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=589.2s	589.2	 Historically, ad networks had, I think initially, a 60-40 rev share where they only paid publishers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=594.4s	594.4	 40% of the revenue the advertiser paid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=597.3s	597.3	 Then the network started to move to a 55-45 model, then a 50-50 model, then a 45-55 model.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=602.8s	602.8	 I believe on average, Google currently is paying somewhere between 70 and 80% of their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=608.9s	608.9	 publishers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=609.9s	609.9	 I've got to check my math on that or whatever the latest report is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=612.9s	612.9	 I heard high 60s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=613.9s	613.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=614.9s	614.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=615.9s	615.9	 But call it 70.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=616.9s	616.9	 It is a very competitive share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=618.8s	618.8	 Now, the point being, because it's an auction system and because it's opt-in by the publisher,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=623.9s	623.9	 if they're not paying the highest price, the publisher can go and get ads from somewhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=627.3s	627.3	 else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=628.3s	628.3	 Historically, publishers built their own sales force to sell ads and to source advertisers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=633.0s	633.0	 and to make money off of their ad inventory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=635.5s	635.5	 It turns out it was a lot more effective to use an ad network to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=639.7s	639.7	 The other ad networks simply haven't been as good at building an auction model and building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=643.4s	643.4	 competitiveness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=644.4s	644.4	 But I will tell you that when you get to a certain volume and it's not a big volume,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=648.6s	648.6	 you don't need a million advertisers bidding against each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=651.5s	651.5	 You only need a few dozen advertisers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=653.6s	653.6	 Once you have a few dozen advertisers bidding against each other, you start to get very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=656.9s	656.9	 competitive in inventory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=658.4s	658.4	 So Google's real lock-in with publishers and the real reason they win in this marketplace
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=662.9s	662.9	 is because they pay the publishers the most.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=666.0s	666.0	 If you try and break this up and if you actually do try and get into the weeds of this whole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=671.2s	671.2	 system and change it, the publishers ultimately will make less money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=675.5s	675.5	 This will be a real problem on the publisher side that they're making the most money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=680.7s	680.7	 They're getting the highest share of advertisers spend and consumers are getting the best quality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=684.4s	684.4	 experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=685.4s	685.4	 That's what makes Google's model so hard to tackle from an antitrust perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=689.8s	689.8	 Because it's giving consistency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=690.8s	690.8	 So basically is what you're saying that because fundamentally this is an auction model, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=696.1s	696.1	 prevents Google from extracting monopoly rents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=699.5s	699.5	 Correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=700.5s	700.5	 And they already pay the highest share on their ad network back to the publishers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=705.0s	705.0	 And so you could go in and say, hey, high 60s or 70%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=707.2s	707.2	 They should be paying 90%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=709.2s	709.2	 What's the real right number?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=710.6s	710.6	 They're already paying more than anyone else to the publishers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=712.9s	712.9	 They're already making a lower margin than anyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=715.3s	715.3	 And I'll say, let me just add two more things, sorry, which I think are just...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=718.2s	718.2	 Well, can I go to J Cal first?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=719.2s	719.2	 I just want to get J Cal in here, even though he wouldn't do the same for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=722.4s	722.4	 J Cal, do you agree with Freeberg that the reason for Google's success is that they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=727.5s	727.5	 hyper efficient and this auction mechanism prevents monopoly behavior?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=732.8s	732.8	 No, there is monopoly behavior going on at Google, obviously, with search and putting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=737.8s	737.8	 their own content and services up top.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=740.1s	740.1	 And to Shemad's point, that's probably the easier target.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=743.9s	743.9	 Here this just feels like they are maybe 10 years behind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=748.2s	748.2	 They should have just blocked the double click acquisition in 2008 and this consolidation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=752.2s	752.2	 of power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=754.5s	754.5	 What publishers would say to Freeberg's point is when you're selling your own advertising,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=760.0s	760.0	 you get a much higher CPM when you go direct to Samsung or IBM or Disney.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=765.3s	765.3	 And so you want to create those direct relationships.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=767.2s	767.2	 How much do those direct relationships cost?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=769.2s	769.2	 It's probably 20 or 30%, which is exactly to the percentage that Google is taking off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=774.3s	774.3	 the top.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=775.3s	775.3	 So Google is pretty aware of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=778.5s	778.5	 But it's just paradoxical that they're doing this at this time, David, because Amazon has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=783.3s	783.3	 developed a huge ad business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=784.7s	784.7	 Netflix and Disney now have ad tiers for their services to go up against YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=790.3s	790.3	 And then for the first time, we're even talking about Google search supremacy being challenged
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=794.1s	794.1	 by chat GPT.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=795.1s	795.1	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=796.8s	796.8	 Much like what happened with Microsoft, you know, they're just late, 10 years too late,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=800.8s	800.8	 maybe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=801.8s	801.8	 Right, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=802.8s	802.8	 So to use one of your favorite words is the DOJ acting as a rug puller here for Google
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=807.3s	807.3	 in the sense that they're trying to unwind 10 year old acquisitions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=810.2s	810.2	 Does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=812.3s	812.3	 Yeah, it doesn't make much sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=814.0s	814.0	 Shouldn't the government be able to unwind acquisitions that happened a decade ago?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=816.8s	816.8	 Does that make any sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=817.8s	817.8	 No, of course not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=819.6s	819.6	 They should learn from it and not do it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=823.0s	823.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=824.0s	824.0	 Tax, what do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=825.1s	825.1	 I think it's a pretty bad way to approach things because they create so much uncertainty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=829.7s	829.7	 in the marketplace and has a chilling effect on future acquisitions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=832.7s	832.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=833.7s	833.7	 Like when you get approval from the government, you want to know you're good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=836.2s	836.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=837.2s	837.2	 And we have an approval process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=838.5s	838.5	 So it seems to me, I agree with J. Cal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=840.3s	840.3	 If the government is going to have a problem with an acquisition, state it up front.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=845.0s	845.0	 But then once they approve it, you're approved, you're done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=847.8s	847.8	 Otherwise, companies will be much less likely to engage in acquisitions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=851.7s	851.7	 And that's going to have a chilling effect on M&A behavior in the ecosystem, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=856.2s	856.2	 bad for the ecosystem as a whole.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=858.4s	858.4	 Well, what it really does is it puts U.S. competitiveness against every other country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=863.6s	863.6	 and any other regulatory regime that'll be more permissive to this stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=868.1s	868.1	 That doesn't make any sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=870.0s	870.0	 And I think this is what's lost on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=871.6s	871.6	 I just feel these lawsuits right now are bordering on the mean spirited because these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=876.8s	876.8	 have been tried.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=878.3s	878.3	 They've generally failed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=880.0s	880.0	 And so the real solution, it always goes back to this, and it's ugly and messy, is you need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=885.3s	885.3	 to rewrite the actual laws to reflect how business conditions exist today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=891.6s	891.6	 And so it's not the responsibility of the DOJ to try to fit a round peg into a square
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=896.5s	896.5	 hole.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=897.5s	897.5	 It doesn't work like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=898.7s	898.7	 And that's what they're trying to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=899.7s	899.7	 They're trying to manipulate and contort the law to try to go after somebody that shouldn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=906.0s	906.0	 frankly be gone after because these deals, to your point, were done a decade ago and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=910.5s	910.5	 they were done legally and they were done rightly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=912.8s	912.8	 So if you have an issue with how the market has evolved, change the law.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=916.4s	916.4	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=917.4s	917.4	 I'll also add, I totally agree with Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=920.0s	920.0	 I think that this action, you know, as one of our friends put it on our on our text stream,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=926.8s	926.8	 it's like killing the golden goose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=928.0s	928.0	 I mean, this is one of the big job creators, innovators and taxpayers and employers and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=932.6s	932.6	 drivers of economic growth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=934.6s	934.6	 Why would we allow that to go and kind of burgeon offshore as a government?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=940.5s	940.5	 This is absolutely going to become kind of an opening for some international competitor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=947.5s	947.5	 to come in and try and provide alternative services with similar economics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=951.4s	951.4	 I'll also say, I just sent you guys a link.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=953.7s	953.7	 I'll send you one more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=955.1s	955.1	 The market itself is becoming so much more challenging to operate in as an ad network.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=961.3s	961.3	 E-commerce, so Amazon's ad business is booming, right, as Chamath pointed out earlier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=966.8s	966.8	 But so much more of consumer behavior is shifting where people are going direct to e-commerce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=970.8s	970.8	 sites and then the ads that are getting the highest click through and where advertisers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=976.0s	976.0	 are spending more and more money is on e-commerce sites.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=978.8s	978.8	 I know this from experience on a couple of boards I'm at where companies stopped spending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=982.6s	982.6	 on Facebook and Google and just started spending exclusively on Amazon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=986.3s	986.3	 And that's where you get consumers that are much more likely to purchase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=988.8s	988.8	 The purchasing proclivity is higher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=990.4s	990.4	 The click through rate is higher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=991.8s	991.8	 So the return on ad spend is much higher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=994.2s	994.2	 And then I think that there's a big shift happening right now, as you guys know, with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=997.6s	997.6	 third party cookies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=998.6s	998.6	 Google has declared that they're removing third party cookies in 2024.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1001.9s	1001.9	 This means that in 2024, it is going to be very hard to track a user from one website
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1008.1s	1008.1	 to the next.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1009.1s	1009.1	 If you go to a website and look at furniture and then you go to another website, third
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1011.9s	1011.9	 party cookies allow an advertiser to find you on that other website knowing that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1016.2s	1016.2	 were just looking at furniture and send you a furniture ad and say, hey, come on over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1020.2s	1020.2	 and you're more likely to click on that ad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1021.5s	1021.5	 It's been very effective for advertising and particularly in the segment of advertising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1025.8s	1025.8	 called retargeting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1027.1s	1027.1	 But it is becoming much harder to do this with third party cookies and with the Apple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1030.6s	1030.6	 identifier being yanked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1032.0s	1032.0	 And Google just made an attempt to try and get this change with the W3C that was rejected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1037.8s	1037.8	 And that change is now going to make this hit very, very hard beginning in 2024.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1041.9s	1041.9	 So the ad networks themselves are already being massively hurt by Apple's ID changes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1047.0s	1047.0	 the third party cookies being removed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1049.0s	1049.0	 It's becoming harder to target consumers, harder to make money for publishers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1053.4s	1053.4	 So meanwhile, the market's being challenged.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1054.8s	1054.8	 Amazon's coming in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1055.8s	1055.8	 This is the inverse definition of a monopoly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1059.1s	1059.1	 When you have a market where there is dynamism, where companies are changing the rules and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1064.0s	1064.0	 that is reallocating share gains to different players, that's the definition of a dynamic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1070.1s	1070.1	 market that's self-regulating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1071.1s	1071.1	 Totally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1072.1s	1072.1	 Five years ago, this would have made more sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1075.0s	1075.0	 Much more sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1076.4s	1076.4	 This goes back down to one basic thing, which is do our elected and appointed officials
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1082.7s	1082.7	 really understand what's going on in the economy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1085.6s	1085.6	 And I think this is an example that highlights not as much as they should.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1091.0s	1091.0	 And before a lawsuit like this gets filed, they should call us up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1097.2s	1097.2	 If they called 30 of us into a room one by one and said, can you please explain how this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1101.7s	1101.7	 works?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1103.6s	1103.6	 You would have come to a different conclusion because we could have articulated these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1107.1s	1107.1	 and it would have been clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1108.9s	1108.9	 And so why do they not do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1111.0s	1111.0	 Or if they do do it, who's actually in there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1114.1s	1114.1	 Either way, whatever's getting to the conclusion of let's go file this lawsuit in 2023 is late
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1120.8s	1120.8	 at a minimum and misguided at best.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1122.9s	1122.9	 You know, you have to ask the question, like, how is this different than Xi Jinping saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1128.2s	1128.2	 you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1129.2s	1129.2	 Jack Ma is too powerful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1130.3s	1130.3	 Therefore, he's going to learn to pay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1132.0s	1132.0	 I think this is like our government saying Google.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1135.1s	1135.1	 It is totally different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1136.1s	1136.1	 Totally different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1137.1s	1137.1	 Other than that, it's the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1138.1s	1138.1	 But I think that this lawsuit makes no sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1142.0s	1142.0	 You always have to bring it back to China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1143.6s	1143.6	 Does everything in your brain have to virtue signal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1146.0s	1146.0	 No, I'm trying to be intellectually interesting conversation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1150.2s	1150.2	 Jason, Jason, Jason, still manning an intellectually honest position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1153.9s	1153.9	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1154.9s	1154.9	 Let me finish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1155.9s	1155.9	 Let me finish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1156.9s	1156.9	 Let me finish before you jump the fence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1160.6s	1160.6	 Very simply, you asked, like, why are they filing something that makes no sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1164.9s	1164.9	 My decision is I think they want to have an outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1168.3s	1168.3	 And their outcome is they want to stick it to big tech because it's too powerful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1171.2s	1171.2	 And then you just said yourself, square peg round hole.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1174.4s	1174.4	 They're trying to find something to get Google on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1176.7s	1176.7	 This is not it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1177.7s	1177.7	 How does it relate to China?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1179.2s	1179.2	 Well, I agree with J. Cal here, actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1182.1s	1182.1	 I'll defend for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1184.5s	1184.5	 World's second greatest moderator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1185.8s	1185.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1186.8s	1186.8	 Third greatest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1187.8s	1187.8	 I'll defend for a second because that could mean a lot of different things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1191.0s	1191.0	 And so I don't want to get hung up on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1193.2s	1193.2	 But it does feel to me like the government is lashing out against companies like Google
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1198.8s	1198.8	 because they're perceived as being too powerful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1201.1s	1201.1	 That's what's going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1202.1s	1202.1	 And in fact, I mean, that's Lena Conn's theory is that we have to stop big tech companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1206.6s	1206.6	 from getting bigger because power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1209.3s	1209.3	 But in this case, it doesn't make any sense because the auction market for advertising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1214.3s	1214.3	 is very competitive and the remedy of unwinding 10 year old deals doesn't make any sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1218.9s	1218.9	 So they're just kind of barking up the wrong tree is sort of the idea here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1222.7s	1222.7	 One final thing, David, there's two other things that they really should be looking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1225.8s	1225.8	 at as these ad networks are losing their market share in the overall digital ad spend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1230.9s	1230.9	 There are two other players, Disney and Deflix doing these digital ads on their platforms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1238.6s	1238.6	 and having ad tiers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1239.6s	1239.6	 And then you may have noticed Uber is doing an ad business now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1242.6s	1242.6	 They did $350 million in the first year of that business, a million a day, and they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1246.9s	1246.9	 projected to do a billion next year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1249.0s	1249.0	 And those have location information in it because you have your destination.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1252.8s	1252.8	 And so those networks and opportunities are emerging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1256.9s	1256.9	 It's a dynamic space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1258.0s	1258.0	 I just want to say like, you guys are making like, I think a really important macro point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1262.2s	1262.2	 which is like in a marketplace, it's always easy to hate the winners and claim that their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1268.9s	1268.9	 success is unfair if you're not part of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1272.6s	1272.6	 And I think that just because something's successful in a marketplace doesn't mean it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1276.5s	1276.5	 a monopoly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1277.5s	1277.5	 You know, this whole thing of envy, you know, we've heard from like the Berkshire shareholders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1284.2s	1284.2	 meeting, I think there was a good conversation around this, but envy really is ultimately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1288.7s	1288.7	 the doom of innovation and democracy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1290.9s	1290.9	 It's like you see the success, you want to take down the successful, nothing can be too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1295.0s	1295.0	 successful or else it has to be destroyed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1297.8s	1297.8	 And then, you know, as we talked about, it's going to go somewhere else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1300.7s	1300.7	 Well, I mean, just play devil's advocate with it on that free bird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1303.5s	1303.5	 It sounds like we all agree that the government has kind of the wrong theory and is barking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1306.7s	1306.7	 up the wrong tree here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1307.6s	1307.6	 However, isn't it the case that Apple and Google are too powerful, maybe not in this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1314.2s	1314.2	 auction, advertising auction marketplace?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1316.7s	1316.7	 But when it comes to the app store, I mean, they have an operating system monopoly with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1321.0s	1321.0	 iOS and Android or duopoly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1323.0s	1323.0	 But I think you're you're bringing up the key point, which is these nuances are the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1326.7s	1326.7	 ones that matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1327.5s	1327.5	 There is a body of law today, David, that you can apply pretty intelligently and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1332.6s	1332.6	 thoughtfully to that exact problem and also to Google search.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1337.3s	1337.3	 And so it's a bit of a head scratcher why the DOJ hasn't spent the time to figure out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1342.2s	1342.2	 to even understand that that's actually where they should be focused, because that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1345.6s	1345.6	 where there is truly in the app store case, it's a duopoly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1351.0s	1351.0	 So it's very clear the share shift has already been set.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1354.5s	1354.5	 There is no share shift happening to a third player.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1356.8s	1356.8	 There is no side loading that's really happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1358.9s	1358.9	 And so domestically in the United States and Western Europe, there's a de facto duopoly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1363.7s	1363.7	 complete control, completely inflexible inelastic pricing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1368.9s	1368.9	 That is a monopoly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1370.7s	1370.7	 And then separately for search in the United States, it is also an effective monopoly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1375.3s	1375.3	 And those are the things where if you really wanted to go after them because you think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1378.8s	1378.8	 there's some damage being done to people, I would have focused there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1382.3s	1382.3	 But the ad business has nothing to do with any of this and just means that they don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1387.2s	1387.2	 understand how the market works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1388.9s	1388.9	 Right. OK, so shifting gears, Microsoft has just been sued on antitrust grounds, or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1394.0s	1394.0	 rather, there's a probe by the EU.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1396.7s	1396.7	 And this was based on a complaint actually from Slack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1400.7s	1400.7	 Slack filed a complaint back in 2020 that Microsoft was basically engaging in bundling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1407.8s	1407.8	 or tying of products.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1409.9s	1409.9	 The allegation is that Microsoft unfairly ties Microsoft Teams and other software to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1415.1s	1415.1	 its widely used Office suite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1417.5s	1417.5	 Do you guys think that's a better claim?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1419.5s	1419.5	 OK, so I mean, I'll just say, like, you know, there was an episode that we did, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1423.5s	1423.5	 back in September, where I basically railed against Microsoft for exactly this kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1428.4s	1428.4	 bundling. It seems like the EU has picked up that theory and wants to go after bundling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1434.5s	1434.5	 We did Slack series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1435.5s	1435.5	 I was on the board, took it public, blah, blah, blah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1438.5s	1438.5	 I'll tell you the thing that we talked about a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1441.7s	1441.7	 That was the thing that I was always like the most afraid of, which is how can we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1448.7s	1448.7	 compete with a better product in the face of superior distribution?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1452.9s	1452.9	 I think what Microsoft did was anticompetitive, but I don't think it was monopolistic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1460.1s	1460.1	 And I think that the EU in that time has a much better framework of laws that they had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1466.3s	1466.3	 demonstrated up until now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1467.7s	1467.7	 They were willing to enforce around anticompetitive pricing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1472.2s	1472.2	 And so part of what Slack was trying to do was create some airspace for that to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1478.5s	1478.5	 into the ether, to the discussion that it's like we could build the best product in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1482.9s	1482.9	 world. But if Microsoft gives it away with this other product that is quasi-essential,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1488.8s	1488.8	 they'll always beat us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1490.5s	1490.5	 And there's nothing we can do about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1492.2s	1492.2	 What do you think? And I think that was basically the question that was posed to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1495.8s	1495.8	 European authorities because we thought that they would pay attention to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1498.5s	1498.5	 What's interesting about it is that then, you know, when the acquisition happened to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1502.7s	1502.7	 Salesforce, it sort of waters down that claim because now Salesforce also has a set of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1508.5s	1508.5	 really essential products that are useful and needed in the market that Slack can go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1513.8s	1513.8	 and attach themselves to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1515.0s	1515.0	 And in many ways, David, it forced the hand of Slack to be acquired by Salesforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1520.6s	1520.6	 And if not Salesforce, it would have to have been somebody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1523.7s	1523.7	 But could it have been an independent company had we not had to compete against teams in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1529.3s	1529.3	 that way? Meaning, if we had to compete against another well-funded startup, would it still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1533.3s	1533.3	 be public? I suspect so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1534.9s	1534.9	 I don't think we would have sold to Salesforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1537.3s	1537.3	 Well, that's exactly was my point when we talked about this last time is that if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1543.0s	1543.0	 Microsoft can basically clone the sort of the breakthrough innovative product, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1549.6s	1549.6	 know, just say they do one every year and then they put a crappy version of that in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1553.8s	1553.8	 their bundle. Yeah, 10 percent or 50 percent worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1557.3s	1557.3	 But they give it away effectively for free as part of the bundle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1560.7s	1560.7	 And then they basically pull the legs out from under that other company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1563.4s	1563.4	 So it can't be a vibrant competitor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1565.7s	1565.7	 And then the next year, they'll just raise the price of the bundle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1568.0s	1568.0	 Right. And they've done that with Slack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1569.8s	1569.8	 They've done that with Okta.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1571.5s	1571.5	 They've done that with Zoom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1573.5s	1573.5	 You know, Jake, how can we have a vibrant tech ecosystem, at least in B2B software,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1579.1s	1579.1	 if Microsoft can just keep doing that indefinitely?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1582.3s	1582.3	 Yeah, it's a difficult question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1584.4s	1584.4	 I don't know, though, if what the consumer harm is here if you keep adding great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1589.1s	1589.1	 features to a bundle. So to take the other side of the argument, you know, Zoom has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1593.2s	1593.2	 now added channels like Slack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1594.8s	1594.8	 Slack has added huddles, which are essentially Zoom calls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1598.9s	1598.9	 And now they're both going to try to add the coda and notion, wiki, wiki style, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1605.2s	1605.2	 know, documents to both Zoom and Slack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1608.0s	1608.0	 So everybody's copying everybody's features.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1609.5s	1609.5	 Everybody's incorporating everybody's features.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1611.4s	1611.4	 It takes a little bit of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1613.4s	1613.4	 This is actually a lot better behavior for Microsoft than the old days when they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1618.2s	1618.2	 would do something called vaporware.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1619.6s	1619.6	 They used to announce products to chill people from buying them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1622.7s	1622.7	 So they would announce a Slack two years before Slack came out just to get people to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1626.3s	1626.3	 not install Slack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1627.7s	1627.7	 They did that with Lotus Notes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1628.7s	1628.7	 They said that a Lotus Notes competitor coming for two years and it never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1631.9s	1631.9	 materialized. So I think the marketplace will compete.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1635.9s	1635.9	 And if you look at Slack itself, it's still growing the same percentage growth it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1641.0s	1641.0	 did inside of Salesforce that it did as an independent company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1645.4s	1645.4	 So it's growing at a similar pace.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1646.4s	1646.4	 I don't know about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1647.1s	1647.1	 Wait, Nick, can you pull up this chart?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1648.9s	1648.9	 Yeah, it was like high teens or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1650.6s	1650.6	 Was there growth?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1651.6s	1651.6	 I mean, it looks like from this chart that Slack has kind of leveled off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1655.1s	1655.1	 That's the number of users I was talking about revenue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1656.8s	1656.8	 OK. If you look at Slack's revenue quarter over quarter, it's basically been the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1661.2s	1661.2	 Wasn't there a report that it's been a little bit of a disappointment to Salesforce?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1664.9s	1664.9	 Well, I mean, you know, this number here that we're looking at, we're at 75 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1669.6s	1669.6	 Microsoft Teams members, 12 million Slack members.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1673.2s	1673.2	 By the way, if you wanted to if you wanted to play conspiracy theories, maybe that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1677.0s	1677.0	 why there is a falling out between Benioff and Brett.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1680.4s	1680.4	 I mean, Brett was the champion of this deal, you know, twenty eight billion dollar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1684.4s	1684.4	 acquisition and twenty billion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1687.1s	1687.1	 It's threading a needle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1688.1s	1688.1	 The only one of that scale that's really worked out definitively has been LinkedIn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1692.3s	1692.3	 So if Slack hiccuped in a moment when we also had a regime change in rates and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1697.1s	1697.1	 valuations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1699.1s	1699.1	 Now look at Benioff as looking down the barrel of activist investor program from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1704.3s	1704.3	 Elliott. Man, I mean, yeah, maybe it's not doing as well as they needed it to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1708.7s	1708.7	 I got the sense that Benioff was genuinely sorry that Brett decided to leave and that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1713.2s	1713.2	 it was voluntary, voluntary on Brett's part and regretted basically, as opposed to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1717.9s	1717.9	 you know, a non-regretted termination.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1720.9s	1720.9	 I have no idea. Like I said, I was I was prequalifying with saying let's play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1724.2s	1724.2	 conspiracy theory for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1725.9s	1725.9	 Fair enough. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1726.9s	1726.9	 But can I have a suggestion?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1727.9s	1727.9	 Blake, I have a suggestion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1729.5s	1729.5	 Here's a suggestion for the regulators that are listening or watching our podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1735.1s	1735.1	 A really valuable thing for the industry that you could do would be to introduce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1739.9s	1739.9	 transparency on ELAs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1741.9s	1741.9	 What are those enterprise licensing agreements?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1744.6s	1744.6	 These are these things that these big companies use to throw everything in the kitchen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1749.2s	1749.2	 sink into a deal when they sell to a company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1752.1s	1752.1	 But if there was transparency and there was a sense of how those things were priced,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1756.8s	1756.8	 so think of it like the FDA saying here's you have to publish your ingredients,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1760.2s	1760.2	 right? And what percentage of it is this and that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1763.3s	1763.3	 It would be really beneficial because it would slow down the tendency of these big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1768.1s	1768.1	 companies to try to kill the small companies with these poorer products.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1772.8s	1772.8	 And something around ELAs and more transparency around pricing to the market could be a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1776.8s	1776.8	 good governor without having to go down the path of all this antitrust legislation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1780.5s	1780.5	 after the fact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1781.5s	1781.5	 I think there is some good advice for regulators there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1783.5s	1783.5	 I think they should focus on anti-competitive tactics and like clarifying what those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1788.1s	1788.1	 are as opposed to some of these crazy lawsuits to break up companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1793.9s	1793.9	 that don't seem to have well-grounded theories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1796.1s	1796.1	 It'd be, I think, better to focus on the specific tactics that create the harm and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1800.1s	1800.1	 identifying what those are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1801.6s	1801.6	 Jake, out of your point about how what Microsoft is doing doesn't seem to be harming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1805.7s	1805.7	 anybody, it seems to be benefiting consumers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1808.2s	1808.2	 I think that's a valid point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1809.9s	1809.9	 But I would bring up a different example, which is if you look at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1814.3s	1814.3	 anti-competitive behavior of dumping, where a company will basically dump its
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1820.2s	1820.2	 product on the market for free, destroy all the other competitors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1823.3s	1823.3	 And once they're out, they can raise prices because the barriers to entry are high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1827.2s	1827.2	 There's a huge cost of like basically entering the industry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1831.0s	1831.0	 I think that this bundling behavior is a form of dumping where in the short run,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1835.9s	1835.9	 it looks like consumers are benefiting because they're getting a Zoom clone for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1839.5s	1839.5	 free or a Slack clone for free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1842.5s	1842.5	 But then what happens is once they've hobbled those companies, they raise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1846.6s	1846.6	 the price of the bundle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1847.8s	1847.8	 So I think if we want to have a healthy long-term ecosystem, I think this type
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1851.4s	1851.4	 of bundling behavior is bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1853.7s	1853.7	 I think it's anti-competitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1855.2s	1855.2	 It's a great point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1856.0s	1856.0	 But I think there's a very specific solution for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1858.0s	1858.0	 You don't need to break up Microsoft.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1859.6s	1859.6	 What you need to do is require that when they create a bundle, every product in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1864.0s	1864.0	 that bundle needs to basically have an individual price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1867.1s	1867.1	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1867.4s	1867.4	 And the price of every product in that bundle should add up to the cost of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1870.5s	1870.5	 bundle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1871.1s	1871.1	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1871.3s	1871.3	 So they can't do, like you said, Chamath, these like transfer payments or subsidies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1875.8s	1875.8	 to basically, you know, take over, systematically take over every set vertical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1880.5s	1880.5	 I think that would be amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1881.5s	1881.5	 By the way, there are many other markets, David, where that exactly exists, where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1884.9s	1884.9	 if you have the ability to preferentially put your product into your distribution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1890.9s	1890.9	 channel, you have to transfer price it transparently at the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1897.5s	1897.5	 And it's what everybody else would be able to get it at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1900.1s	1900.1	 And that then allows the best product to win in the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1904.9s	1904.9	 And it gives the government the ability to say, I understand that these rails are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1909.1s	1909.1	 roughly monopolistic, but I'm going to leave them alone as long as you treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1913.4s	1913.4	 everything that sits on top of those rails equally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1916.6s	1916.6	 And that nuance is missing in software.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1918.5s	1918.5	 So I think the combination of transparency in these enterprise licensing agreements
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1922.8s	1922.8	 and more transparency and accounting treatment for what you just said would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1927.1s	1927.1	 solve a lot of this problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1928.7s	1928.7	 And you would have a more vibrant ecosystem where the big guys can't just snuff out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1932.9s	1932.9	 the small guys whenever they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1934.6s	1934.6	 Yeah, I just agree with you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1936.1s	1936.1	 Let me just, let me just play, let me just play my devil's advocate, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1940.1s	1940.1	 kind of how I feel as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1941.9s	1941.9	 I think these concepts of monopolistic bundling made a lot of sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1947.2s	1947.2	 I make a lot of sense in the sense if what you're bundling and the service or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1951.4s	1951.4	 the product or whatever is a commodity product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1953.9s	1953.9	 And these statements that you're making assume that one messaging service is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1958.5s	1958.5	 same as another messaging service, that one video app is the same as another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1962.0s	1962.0	 video app and that by giving a discount, they're going to win the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1967.1s	1967.1	 The reality that may have made sense back in the day when there were things that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1970.6s	1970.6	 trains and trains had a monopoly on where things could go or electricity or oil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1974.4s	1974.4	 production and all of the kind of origins of kind of monopolistic antitrust laws
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1981.6s	1981.6	 and actions started to kind of emerge here in our free market in the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1985.5s	1985.5	 But when it comes to software, if your product is the same as the other guy's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1989.7s	1989.7	 product, maybe they deserve to win by bundling and maybe it's okay for them to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1994.3s	1994.3	 offer a discount and beat you on pricing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=1996.5s	1996.5	 Because if your product is actually better, then you're going to win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2000.5s	2000.5	 And it provides better ROI for the customer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2002.5s	2002.5	 It has a better feature set.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2003.9s	2003.9	 It's faster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2004.9s	2004.9	 It has a bunch of stuff that the other product doesn't have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2007.3s	2007.3	 The market will pick it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2008.8s	2008.8	 It's not that the market's going to say, hey, we're just a bunch of idiots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2011.9s	2011.9	 These products are so differentiated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2013.5s	2013.5	 But because these guys are giving me a discount, I'm going to go over to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2015.7s	2015.7	 discount. That's not how it works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2017.4s	2017.4	 And you guys know this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2018.5s	2018.5	 I'm not saying that Microsoft can't copy Slack and then undercharge a different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2022.6s	2022.6	 price and charge a different price and a lower price and discount it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2025.7s	2025.7	 What I'm saying is they can't cross subsidize their Slack competitor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2029.7s	2029.7	 It's the fact that they can copy Slack that makes Slack that means that Slack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2035.3s	2035.3	 should lose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2036.2s	2036.2	 The fact that that Slack can't actually create something that's differentiated enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2039.9s	2039.9	 Look, new software is really hard to create, but really easy to copy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2045.2s	2045.2	 I mean, the first version of a new product is hard to create, but you can reverse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2049.9s	2049.9	 engineer almost any software product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2051.8s	2051.8	 Show me where someone's made a better competitor to Google search.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2055.0s	2055.0	 Show me where consumers don't choose to go to another search engine because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2057.7s	2057.7	 Google's built a better search engine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2059.1s	2059.1	 No, it's because there's a data network effect there that the more searches they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2062.0s	2062.0	 provide, the more data they get.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2063.8s	2063.8	 It's the reinforcement learning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2065.0s	2065.0	 I'll say it differently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2066.2s	2066.2	 It's easier to copy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2067.6s	2067.6	 There's an asymptote to that quality point, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2069.5s	2069.5	 I don't think that that's necessarily true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2071.0s	2071.0	 No, I think there's a nuance here that...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2072.6s	2072.6	 And by the way, all the social networks that people thought were had massive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2075.3s	2075.3	 lock-in effect turns out they don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2076.5s	2076.5	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2076.8s	2076.8	 David, no, that's not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2078.1s	2078.1	 Look, there's more lock-in deeper in the stack that you exist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2082.3s	2082.3	 There's very little lock-in at the application layer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2084.7s	2084.7	 So workflow apps, which effectively is what most of these enterprise software
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2089.4s	2089.4	 things are, are very copyable because there's nothing that really locks it in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2095.0s	2095.0	 But if you're a social network or if you're some deep machine learned thing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2098.8s	2098.8	 basically generates great search results, that's much harder to copy because more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2102.8s	2102.8	 and more of the product generates the product quality is underneath the waterline.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2107.7s	2107.7	 But I think in enterprise software, it's all thin UI layers on top of very simple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2113.5s	2113.5	 workforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2114.0s	2114.0	 Then don't compete because the bigger guy that offers a discount is always going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2116.9s	2116.9	 beat you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2117.2s	2117.2	 What he's saying, which I agree with, is you just, if you could add transparency so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2121.6s	2121.6	 that you understand what is happening, I don't think anybody's against transparency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2125.7s	2125.7	 Nobody should be against it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2127.3s	2127.3	 And if Microsoft wants to charge a penny a seat for teams, then they should be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2133.3s	2133.3	 allowed to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2134.0s	2134.0	 I don't think we're saying that they shouldn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2135.5s	2135.5	 A lot of startups have used the opposite tactic where they've entered with free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2138.5s	2138.5	 offerings or free services, and then they try and upsell later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2141.6s	2141.6	 And we don't complain about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2143.2s	2143.2	 There's a lot of ways to compete in the marketplace.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2144.7s	2144.7	 There's no bundling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2145.9s	2145.9	 There's no bundling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2146.7s	2146.7	 There's no dumping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2147.7s	2147.7	 But that's my point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2148.4s	2148.4	 There's a lot of ways to compete in the marketplace if the product you're offering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2151.1s	2151.1	 is of parity or is a commodity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2153.9s	2153.9	 Build something that's different enough that people are willing to pay for it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2159.0s	2159.0	 that they're willing to pay more than they'll pay the big guy that's giving them a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2161.7s	2161.7	 bundling discount.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2162.5s	2162.5	 Just build a better product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2163.8s	2163.8	 Then the whole B2B SaaS space should basically pack up shop and go home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2167.5s	2167.5	 We should just stop funding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2169.0s	2169.0	 VC should just stop funding new SaaS companies because...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2172.0s	2172.0	 And all those productivity gains will just go out the window.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2174.9s	2174.9	 Why would you fund any innovative product?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2176.6s	2176.6	 It's a definition of anti-competitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2178.1s	2178.1	 Then how's that bad for the customer?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2180.2s	2180.2	 They're paying less and they're getting a better product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2181.8s	2181.8	 There'll be fewer new products created.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2183.4s	2183.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2183.6s	2183.6	 Freeburg, at the limit, what you're basically saying is because Comcast is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2187.3s	2187.3	 monopolistic provider of my internet connection, I should have to take their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2191.1s	2191.1	 video offering and will never use Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2194.0s	2194.0	 No, they offer a commodity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2196.3s	2196.3	 That's my point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2197.4s	2197.4	 If you're offering a commodity, these things should apply.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2199.4s	2199.4	 It makes a ton of sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2200.7s	2200.7	 But what you're saying effectively and what you just said is that B2B
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2204.1s	2204.1	 software is effectively a commodity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2205.7s	2205.7	 Anyone can copy it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2206.8s	2206.8	 Anyone can replicate it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2207.8s	2207.8	 If Comcast said to you, I'm turning this off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2209.9s	2209.9	 You only have one choice and it's mine because these is my rails and I built it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2214.4s	2214.4	 You would turn to the government to help you because you would say, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2217.4s	2217.4	 Netflix is a better product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2219.7s	2219.7	 And what David is saying is the exact same argument.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2222.7s	2222.7	 So my point is, unless you also believe logically that you're allowed to turn off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2226.3s	2226.3	 Netflix if you're Comcast and take their crappy VOD service, then you're at least
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2232.0s	2232.0	 intellectually consistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2233.7s	2233.7	 Well, steel is a commodity too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2235.5s	2235.5	 Steel is a commodity too and you can't engage in dumping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2239.1s	2239.1	 I mean, this is the argument is that, for example, you know, with respect to China,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2243.0s	2243.0	 the argument was that they were dumping cheap steel in the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2246.5s	2246.5	 market to drive all the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2247.5s	2247.5	 producers out of business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2248.9s	2248.9	 And then once they were out of business, they'd raise the price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2250.8s	2250.8	 The point is there's all these examples where we have had the intelligence and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2254.5s	2254.5	 the ability to be nuanced about this, to see that these things are possible and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2258.0s	2258.0	 they shouldn't exist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2259.1s	2259.1	 We don't let Comcast turn off Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2262.0s	2262.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2262.3s	2262.3	 We have a law around that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2264.3s	2264.3	 I understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2264.9s	2264.9	 So I think what we're saying is embrace and extend this law for these new markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2270.1s	2270.1	 that didn't exist 50 and a hundred years ago when these laws were written so that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2274.3s	2274.3	 the same benefits that we have in the steel market and in the cable market we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2278.9s	2278.9	 have in the software market, it'll just create a healthier ecosystem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2281.9s	2281.9	 J.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2282.1s	2282.1	 Cal, you want to get in on this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2283.5s	2283.5	 I think I was going to say, I wonder when you install Teams, does it automatically,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2288.4s	2288.4	 when you install the Microsoft Office suite, does it automatically install Teams?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2292.3s	2292.3	 Because it does seem the default there matters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2294.3s	2294.3	 Do people have to actively turn it on or is it actively built in?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2297.5s	2297.5	 And so the bundling of it, I think, matters and then interoperability matters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2301.6s	2301.6	 So there are other vectors here to force them into interoperability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2306.2s	2306.2	 So if you open your Windows machine, do you have a choice of which browser?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2311.1s	2311.1	 Let's just say that you use Exchange for certain things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2316.7s	2316.7	 But in other things, for example, to manage your namespace, you may use Okta.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2320.5s	2320.5	 But then they say, actually, no, we need you to use our version of Okta.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2325.3s	2325.3	 It all becomes complicated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2326.7s	2326.7	 I think it's too complicated for a government to understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2329.2s	2329.2	 So I think the general thing is, can we extend the definition of these basic rules
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2335.3s	2335.3	 that we've agreed to in other markets to include technology?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2339.1s	2339.1	 And would we be better served?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2341.0s	2341.0	 And I think for the most part, I do think it would be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2343.6s	2343.6	 It would better serve startups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2345.4s	2345.4	 It would better serve the folks that want to build products.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2347.9s	2347.9	 How would that work in practicality, though?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2349.5s	2349.5	 You would you would have Office say, here's Teams,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2353.3s	2353.3	 turned it on for a dollar a person or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2355.3s	2355.3	 Here's introductory price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2356.7s	2356.7	 I think the combination of what David said and I said would do the trick,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2359.6s	2359.6	 which is if you force these highly complicated license agreements to be transparent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2365.2s	2365.2	 it would not allow them to dump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2367.9s	2367.9	 And then the second thing is that all of that transfer pricing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2371.3s	2371.3	 that goes into that license cost needs to sum up to the cost itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2375.3s	2375.3	 Now, why is that important?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2376.7s	2376.7	 You can learn about how they prevent this in health care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2380.8s	2380.8	 So let's take Pfizer. Good example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2382.4s	2382.4	 Here's a company with 30 billion dollars on the balance sheet. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2386.5s	2386.5	 And Pfizer has a need still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2390.1s	2390.1	 to subsidize all of the R&D of their drugs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2392.3s	2392.3	 And you would say, well, yeah, they have 30 billion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2394.4s	2394.4	 So they should just take the money off the balance sheet and do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2396.5s	2396.5	 Why don't they do it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2397.7s	2397.7	 It's because the accounting laws and all of the complicated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2400.2s	2400.2	 and anti-competitive laws say, well, if you want to take this cash pile
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2403.1s	2403.1	 and use it over here, it goes from an asset liability item,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2408.3s	2408.3	 30 billion of cash, and all of a sudden I'm going to net it against your EPS.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2412.7s	2412.7	 All right, Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2413.9s	2413.9	 I think there's an actual cost for these companies to do this stuff,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2418.7s	2418.7	 to bundle, to cross to all of this stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2420.5s	2420.5	 And so what do they do? They go into the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2422.7s	2422.7	 They ask startups to build stuff and then they buy it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2425.1s	2425.1	 That's the kind of market I think is better for us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2427.1s	2427.1	 Yeah. Let's have that be the last word on this topic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2429.0s	2429.0	 as we've been going for a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2429.9s	2429.9	 But I'm glad you brought up Pfizer, because this brings us to issue two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2434.1s	2434.1	 Oh, boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2435.5s	2435.5	 Which is and I think we can show this clip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2437.6s	2437.6	 Red meat for David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2438.4s	2438.4	 Yeah. So Albert Burlow, who's the CEO of Pfizer, went to Davos last week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2442.9s	2442.9	 and he probably expect to Davos, you know, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2446.4s	2446.4	 the conference, the surplus elites.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2448.5s	2448.5	 And he expected probably nothing but softballs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2451.6s	2451.6	 and fawning treatment from the establishment media.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2453.7s	2453.7	 And instead, he probably had the most uncomfortable walk of his life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2457.0s	2457.0	 when two reporters from Rebel News approached him outside the room
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2461.0s	2461.0	 and started asking him some tough questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2463.7s	2463.7	 Let's roll tape. What's Rebel News?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2466.2s	2466.2	 Or like, can I ask you, when did you know that the vaccines didn't stop transmission?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2471.8s	2471.8	 How long did you know that without saying it publicly?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2474.7s	2474.7	 Thank you very much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2475.9s	2475.9	 I'm sorry. Question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2477.8s	2477.8	 I mean, we now know that the vaccines didn't stop transmission.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2481.7s	2481.7	 But why did you keep it secret?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2484.8s	2484.8	 Good question. You said it was 100 percent effective, then 90 percent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2488.4s	2488.4	 then 80 percent, then 70 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2490.9s	2490.9	 But we now know that the vaccines do not trans stop transmission.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2494.3s	2494.3	 Why did you keep that secret?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2496.3s	2496.3	 Have a nice day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2497.5s	2497.5	 I won't have a nice day until I know the answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2500.4s	2500.4	 Why did you keep it a secret that your vaccine did not stop transmission?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2505.4s	2505.4	 We'll come in. We should we should cut this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2507.4s	2507.4	 OK, we can stop from there. But that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2509.0s	2509.0	 Wow. Welcome to Info Wars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2510.6s	2510.6	 All in it for us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2511.6s	2511.6	 That's what real journalism looks like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2513.0s	2513.0	 First of all, you know, real journalism looks like not a bunch of New York Times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2516.9s	2516.9	 reporters covering for powerful people, but asking them tough questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2520.5s	2520.5	 OK, is that a legitimate question, Freiburg?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2522.5s	2522.5	 Is that a legitimate question?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2524.3s	2524.3	 Freiburg, what do you think of the question? Is it legit or not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2526.3s	2526.3	 You got you guys are about to get us down ranked on YouTube and Spotify.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2530.3s	2530.3	 What's the word? We're about to get warning labels.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2532.1s	2532.1	 Why is this covering for this sort of thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2534.6s	2534.6	 Yeah, I mean, you're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2535.9s	2535.9	 You're right that YouTube banned that video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2539.1s	2539.1	 We had to watch it on Twitter because Elon Musk Twitter is still free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2542.9s	2542.9	 OK, listen, you actually protecting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2544.7s	2544.7	 Why? Hold on. Why is YouTube abridging freedom of the press
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2549.3s	2549.3	 in order to protect the powerful CEO of Pfizer from answering more questions?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2553.6s	2553.6	 That is a question. Yeah, just their basic questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2557.6s	2557.6	 Is it a legitimate question of did they cover up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2561.7s	2561.7	 the fact that the vaccines didn't transmit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2564.4s	2564.4	 I think it's like a legitimate question that I would actually want to be answered to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2567.7s	2567.7	 I don't know why you didn't just answer that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2569.4s	2569.4	 No, we didn't cover it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2572.4s	2572.4	 Freiburg, what are you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2573.9s	2573.9	 You're asking me if I know what whether Pfizer did a cover up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2576.9s	2576.9	 Is that what you're like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2578.5s	2578.5	 Well, no, it's a legitimate question is what I'm getting at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2580.7s	2580.7	 Why are you unwilling to question the Pfizer CEO?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2583.7s	2583.7	 Oh, no, I'm not. I'm not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2584.7s	2584.7	 I'm not unwilling to question at all, but I'm not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2586.6s	2586.6	 I don't think that this is a fight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2588.0s	2588.0	 Look, first of all, Pfizer is a commercial enterprise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2592.4s	2592.4	 So they have the incentive to make money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2594.3s	2594.3	 Hundred percent. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2595.3s	2595.3	 So their objective is to sell a vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2597.1s	2597.1	 I think they're making 10 to 15 billion dollars on this vaccine this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2602.1s	2602.1	 You're absolutely right that the economic incentive is there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2605.4s	2605.4	 for Pfizer to continue to push and rationalize the sales of this vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2610.5s	2610.5	 The efficacy of the vaccine wane very quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2613.7s	2613.7	 As this virus evolved and mutated, it became pretty evident, pretty fast that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2619.1s	2619.1	 The the rate of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2621.9s	2621.9	 Transmission in vaccinated people continue to go up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2626.3s	2626.3	 And, you know, this may be a function of the quality of the vaccine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2629.7s	2629.7	 or the efficacy of the vaccine, more likely a function of the fact that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2633.6s	2633.6	 the virus as predicted evolved and therefore the antibodies that are produced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2638.7s	2638.7	 and the response that that's induced by the original vaccine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2642.9s	2642.9	 becomes less efficacious over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2645.0s	2645.0	 So the real question is a policy question, a behavioral question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2647.9s	2647.9	 But look, Pfizer didn't have another product to sell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2650.1s	2650.1	 So it certainly makes sense for them to continue to sell their product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2652.9s	2652.9	 And there is still good data that represents that there is some immune
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2657.3s	2657.3	 response and some benefit in certain populations to continuing to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2661.5s	2661.5	 a booster and all this stuff with the original.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2663.3s	2663.3	 Yeah, let me ask you about the data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2664.7s	2664.7	 The fact that that Pfizer only has this product to sell is not exactly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2668.1s	2668.1	 a ringing endorsement of their behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2669.4s	2669.4	 But let's stay on the data for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2671.7s	2671.7	 There was a study in Nature, which is, you know, one of the most preeminent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2675.6s	2675.6	 scientific journals about the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2680.3s	2680.3	 which is basically inflammation of the heart tissue, which can basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2683.7s	2683.7	 lead to heart attacks, saying that the risk among young people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2688.3s	2688.3	 especially young men in 18 to 24 years, was elevated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2693.0s	2693.0	 if they got the vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2694.4s	2694.4	 This was a study out of France.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2698.1s	2698.1	 So it's pretty clear that the vaccine wasn't as efficacious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2702.9s	2702.9	 as we thought, but is it less safe than we thought as well?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2705.7s	2705.7	 I generally don't know the answer to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2707.8s	2707.8	 I would like to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2709.1s	2709.1	 It's an important question, and there's a lot of work being done to uncover it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2712.7s	2712.7	 And here's a link to a paper that was published.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2716.0s	2716.0	 In the journal, Circulation is the name of the journal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2720.6s	2720.6	 not too long ago by a team led by a researcher at Mass General.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2725.5s	2725.5	 And what this and so just to address the myocarditis question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2731.2s	2731.2	 And just so everyone that's listening knows, I take a very objective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2734.7s	2734.7	 view on all this stuff. I don't have a strong bias one way or the other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2737.1s	2737.1	 So the Mass General team identified 16 people that had myocarditis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2741.1s	2741.1	 that were vaccinated and 45 people that didn't were part of their control group.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2745.7s	2745.7	 And they tried to understand what the difference was between these two groups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2749.3s	2749.3	 There have historically been three kind of theories about why there is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2752.7s	2752.7	 incidence of myocarditis in certain populations that get the covid vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2757.9s	2757.9	 And by the way, the incidence rate is still typically less than two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2761.5s	2761.5	 out of every 100,000 people that get the vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2764.2s	2764.2	 But as you saw in the paper, you just shared about the number of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2766.9s	2766.9	 who have been vaccinated and others have validated it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2769.5s	2769.5	 It can be as high as 30 times more likely to happen in young people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2773.7s	2773.7	 that take the Moderna vaccine, which is still a low incidence,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2777.0s	2777.0	 but 30 times higher is significant and worth understanding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2780.7s	2780.7	 So the three kind of reasons or the three ideas that are times higher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2783.9s	2783.9	 That sounds like a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2785.2s	2785.2	 Yeah. So the reason and off a small base, but yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2788.0s	2788.0	 And so the three ideas or the three theories around why this is happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2792.4s	2792.4	 Number one is what's called protein mimicry, where certain people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2796.4s	2796.4	 their heart tissue, for example, or certain proteins found in the cells
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2799.1s	2799.1	 in their heart tissue, maybe look like some element of the spike protein
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2804.3s	2804.3	 that's created by the vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2805.7s	2805.7	 Therefore, when you make antibodies to bind to and clear your body of spike protein,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2810.5s	2810.5	 it's also binding to your own cells and causing an autoimmune response.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2815.2s	2815.2	 And those are called kind of auto antibodies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2817.9s	2817.9	 The second is just general immune system activation that maybe genetically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2820.9s	2820.9	 some people are predisposed to having a very active immune system in response
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2824.2s	2824.2	 to the vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2825.0s	2825.0	 And therefore, with a very active immune system, they get inflammation and damage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2827.9s	2827.9	 And then the third is this idea that there's just massive proliferation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2831.5s	2831.5	 of your B cells, some of which have auto antibodies and some of which therefore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2835.1s	2835.1	 destroy your heart tissue and cause this inflammation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2837.4s	2837.4	 So what this team did is they looked at the blood difference between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2840.3s	2840.3	 people that had myocarditis and people that didn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2843.1s	2843.1	 They found no auto antibodies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2844.9s	2844.9	 They found no big changes in the T or B cell populations, meaning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2848.3s	2848.3	 that there isn't a big immune system activation difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2850.9s	2850.9	 The big difference that they found was that the people that had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2854.1s	2854.1	 myocarditis actually had a lot of the spike protein floating around in their blood,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2861.0s	2861.0	 whereas the people that did not have the spike protein floating around in their blood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2864.4s	2864.4	 So this answers one question, but opens up many more doors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2868.3s	2868.3	 which is what's really going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2869.5s	2869.5	 So if you have spike protein in your blood and your body's not clearing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2873.2s	2873.2	 Right. Well, how long after getting vaccinated were the spike proteins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2876.8s	2876.8	 still floating around?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2877.6s	2877.6	 Because I remember when the mRNA vaccine first came out, they said the spike proteins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2881.7s	2881.7	 would go away after a couple of days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2883.5s	2883.5	 Three weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2884.9s	2884.9	 Three weeks after the vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2886.1s	2886.1	 Have they done a study like, you know, six months after or a year after?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2889.7s	2889.7	 Not yet, but that's being done right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2891.6s	2891.6	 So what they're identifying is what's going on with the immune system of this population
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2896.7s	2896.7	 where their body is not able to clear the spike protein.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2899.2s	2899.2	 And when their body doesn't clear the spike protein, a bunch of cytokines and other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2902.9s	2902.9	 inflammatory things start to get released and it causes inflammation on the heart tissue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2907.4s	2907.4	 because there's a particular set of reasons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2910.2s	2910.2	 Jake, I want to ask you, I remember, I remember when, you know, the vaccine first came out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2916.0s	2916.0	 I remember Rogan almost got canceled for saying that if he was a young person, a young man,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2922.3s	2922.3	 he's like 50.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2923.1s	2923.1	 So he got vaccinated, but he said that if I was a young person in my 20s, I would not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2927.3s	2927.3	 get vaccinated because I don't think the risk return makes sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2932.3s	2932.3	 And he almost got canceled for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2933.6s	2933.6	 Was Rogan right about that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2935.9s	2935.9	 So, you know, I have been thinking a lot about this decision to get vaccinated or not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2943.8s	2943.8	 and how we came to that decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2945.5s	2945.5	 And then I think what Freebrook said earlier is super interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2950.9s	2950.9	 Because the virus mutated, the efficacy of these vaccines obviously changed and wasn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2956.7s	2956.7	 necessary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2957.8s	2957.8	 And so I think it was a moving target to understand if you should take it or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2963.0s	2963.0	 It was a very personal decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2964.3s	2964.3	 Clearly, for people who were over 65 years old, the chances of dying were pretty significant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2970.7s	2970.7	 For people under that a certain age, it was lower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2973.1s	2973.1	 So everybody had to make a very personal decision here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2976.3s	2976.3	 Wait, hold on a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2978.3s	2978.3	 Was it a personal decision when you had vaccine mandates?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2982.3s	2982.3	 And then on top of that, on top of that, you had the media were dunking on anti-vaxxers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2989.2s	2989.2	 throughout 2021.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2990.3s	2990.3	 Remember that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2991.5s	2991.5	 They were saying about anti-vaxxers that if you didn't get the vaccine and you got sick,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2995.4s	2995.4	 there wouldn't be a hospital bed for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=2997.5s	2997.5	 There was a lot of dancing on the graves of these people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3001.1s	3001.1	 Where there were all these articles that would be some preacher who said don't get vaccinated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3007.0s	3007.0	 and then they would die of COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3008.2s	3008.2	 And there's a lot of morbid, ghoulish articles dancing on their graves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3013.4s	3013.4	 It was not this objective personal decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3015.5s	3015.5	 There was tremendous social and legal pressure to get vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3019.3s	3019.3	 You're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3019.8s	3019.8	 Was there not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3020.5s	3020.5	 You're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3021.1s	3021.1	 There was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3021.6s	3021.6	 And I think part of the reason I myself got vaccinated was because I wanted to be able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3026.3s	3026.3	 to travel again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3027.0s	3027.0	 I wanted to be able to go to Madison Square Garden and watch the Knicks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3029.6s	3029.6	 And I also thought, well, I don't want to be, if I'm overweight,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3032.8s	3032.8	 one of the people who dies from this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3034.7s	3034.7	 So we all sat here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3036.5s	3036.5	 We all got vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3037.9s	3037.9	 Do we regret our decision to get vaccinated now that we see this studies?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3042.4s	3042.4	 Maybe it wasn't necessary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3044.5s	3044.5	 And also it was apparently oversold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3046.7s	3046.7	 When the Pfizer CEO won't say when they knew it wasn't going to stop transmission,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3051.1s	3051.1	 I think it's a valid question to investigate what Pfizer knew and when.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3055.8s	3055.8	 And just keep everybody accountable for this, for future things that happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3059.4s	3059.4	 Because right now we're in a position where if Pfizer is not being honest with us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3064.7s	3064.7	 if the origin story of COVID isn't being honest with us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3067.3s	3067.3	 these conspiracy theories are now starting to start to look like reality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3071.4s	3071.4	 Let me go to you, Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3073.1s	3073.1	 So we all felt this tremendous pressure in 2021 to get the vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3080.0s	3080.0	 We all care about our health.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3081.6s	3081.6	 You care a lot about your health.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3084.2s	3084.2	 We all thought we could trust the experts that the vaccine was both efficacious and safe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3090.2s	3090.2	 We know it was not efficacious in the sense that they're telling us that we have to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3094.1s	3094.1	 revaccinated every two months for it to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3096.9s	3096.9	 On safety, I don't want to get over my skis because we only have some data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3101.4s	3101.4	 But clearly, this myocarditis data is not good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3105.4s	3105.4	 So were we basically stampeded into making a decision that was not actually good for us?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3112.1s	3112.1	 And would you make that same decision today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3115.9s	3115.9	 Let's just lay the foundation for understanding how we got here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3118.7s	3118.7	 So there are these pathways inside the FDA to get drugs approved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3125.1s	3125.1	 And if you take a normal pathway for a normal drug,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3128.5s	3128.5	 you're going to spend nine or 10 years, maybe more 12, 13, in some cases,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3134.0s	3134.0	 more than a billion dollars to get a drug approved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3136.7s	3136.7	 And the way that it works is in phase one, you do a study on toxicology,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3141.4s	3141.4	 effectively like is this safe or not safe?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3144.1s	3144.1	 And you have to have enough people take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3146.3s	3146.3	 And you need to observe them for enough time where that phase one outcome essentially says
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3151.4s	3151.4	 this won't hurt people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3152.9s	3152.9	 It's benign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3154.0s	3154.0	 We don't know the mechanism of action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3156.1s	3156.1	 We don't know whether it's going to solve the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3158.5s	3158.5	 But we know that it's safe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3160.3s	3160.3	 And then in phase two, you then try to really understand the mechanism of action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3166.4s	3166.4	 And if that works, you go into phase three, where you actually scale it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3171.1s	3171.1	 You create a double arm study.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3173.1s	3173.1	 You may do a control group.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3174.3s	3174.3	 You may do an open label companion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3175.9s	3175.9	 You may overpower it with thousands of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3179.0s	3179.0	 And the FDA is incredibly rigorous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3181.9s	3181.9	 Even down to like, it's incredible, by the way, like how you're allowed to open the results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3186.4s	3186.4	 And they have all of these services that make sure that you can't influence the results or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3191.8s	3191.8	 manipulate them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3192.6s	3192.6	 It's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3193.2s	3193.2	 The FDA has an incredible process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3195.8s	3195.8	 The thing is that they also have a way to jump around that fence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3200.0s	3200.0	 And that is what we use for the COVID-19 vaccines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3203.1s	3203.1	 So in a molecule, 13 years, if it's for a really important drug,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3209.5s	3209.5	 you can shorten it to six or seven with this thing called breakthrough designation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3214.5s	3214.5	 For a biologic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3216.7s	3216.7	 12 or 13 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3218.2s	3218.2	 But if you get this thing called RMAT, six or seven years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3221.9s	3221.9	 So you're still talking years and thousands of people, David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3225.9s	3225.9	 But then there's this one special asterisk that exists inside the FDA called emergency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3230.8s	3230.8	 use authorization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3232.7s	3232.7	 And in moments of deemed emergency, you can shorten even six years down to in some cases,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3239.0s	3239.0	 six, seven, nine months, a year, two years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3241.5s	3241.5	 Pete Slauson Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3242.1s	3242.1	 Are you describing operation warp speed?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3245.1s	3245.1	 So that emergency use authorization fast tracked these vaccines to market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3251.0s	3251.0	 Now, the thing to keep in mind is there are still two classes of vaccines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3255.1s	3255.1	 There are the messenger RNA vaccines, that's the BioNTech and Pfizer ones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3258.5s	3258.5	 And then there are the more regular ones that in many cases the West was dumping on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3262.6s	3262.6	 AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3264.3s	3264.3	 As an example, we used to ship those to developing countries and say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3267.8s	3267.8	 we'll just keep the mRNA ones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3270.0s	3270.0	 You guys, Dave Chappelle had this funny joke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3272.0s	3272.0	 He's like, I took the J&J vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3274.2s	3274.2	 Right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3275.5s	3275.5	 But it turns out that now when we're looking back, the long tail of issues may actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3281.1s	3281.1	 apply to these things that were fast tracked, these mRNA vaccines that were fast tracked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3285.3s	3285.3	 under emergency use.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3286.3s	3286.3	 Why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3286.5s	3286.5	 Because of what Friedberg said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3288.1s	3288.1	 This protein mimicry thing is something we don't understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3290.7s	3290.7	 Now, why don't we understand it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3292.7s	3292.7	 It's because our tools are not precise enough to exactly know when we engineer these solutions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3301.9s	3301.9	 that it only binds to this specific protein.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3306.9s	3306.9	 And what we're learning is that these proteins are so similar that there can be a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3313.2s	3313.2	 collateral damage that this other thing that looks 99% will also all of a sudden attract
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3321.4s	3321.4	 this antigen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3322.0s	3322.0	 So this is a very complicated body of problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3326.7s	3326.7	 And because we didn't give it enough time to bake in the wild,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3330.4s	3330.4	 we're learning about this thing in real time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3332.6s	3332.6	 If we had gone to what you had suggested, which is a massive masking mandate while this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3338.7s	3338.7	 stuff played out, could the outcome be different?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3341.5s	3341.5	 Well, we don't know because we didn't make those decisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3344.5s	3344.5	 But I think that's what people will be debating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3346.3s	3346.3	 The last thing I'll say on this is specifically to myocarditis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3350.4s	3350.4	 I have an interventional cardiologist in LA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3352.5s	3352.5	 I've seen him every three years ever since Goldie passed away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3357.1s	3357.1	 Out of respect for Goldie and Cheryl who initially asked me to go,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3360.3s	3360.3	 but it's been a great thing that I've done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3362.6s	3362.6	 I've learned a lot from him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3363.7s	3363.7	 He introduced me to PCSK9 inhibitors and a bunch of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3367.6s	3367.6	 He called me two years ago and said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3369.6s	3369.6	 Chimath, I want to do a study that, or a year ago, I want to do a study that looks at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3374.8s	3374.8	 actually myocarditis and the effects of this vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3378.3s	3378.3	 And Nick, I don't know if you can just throw it up, but we published something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3381.1s	3381.1	 And basically, you know, what we see, David, is that for folks with myocarditis,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3386.0s	3386.0	 you're releasing troponin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3387.9s	3387.9	 And this is a protein that you would otherwise use to figure out whether you're having a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3393.1s	3393.1	 heart attack or severe, you know, some sort of heart abnormality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3398.2s	3398.2	 And so it just goes to show you that there is some collateral damage in some cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3402.5s	3402.5	 In this example, this is one case that we published, which is a 63-year-old white woman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3407.6s	3407.6	 I'm saying that implicitly so that people understand that these things really matter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3411.2s	3411.2	 on age, gender, and race.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3412.7s	3412.7	 All of the data that comes out of France really was focused on, I think it was 18 to 34-year-old
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3417.9s	3417.9	 males of all racial persuasions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3421.0s	3421.0	 And we thought that this issue is prevalent only in males, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3425.9s	3425.9	 we've had a few cases that we've talked about now that touch women as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3429.6s	3429.6	 So it's a complicated set of things because our tools are not fine grain enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3436.5s	3436.5	 to engineer the drug for incredible species species.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3441.3s	3441.3	 And I think that's the thing that we're dealing with now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3444.2s	3444.2	 And by the way, last thing, because of all this, it probably is reasonable to take a step back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3451.1s	3451.1	 and have a commission that just uncovers all of this stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3453.7s	3453.7	 Look, we've had commissions for things as benign as-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3455.5s	3455.5	 Right, I totally agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3456.2s	3456.2	 We need an investigation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3456.8s	3456.8	 Has steroid usage in baseball?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3458.3s	3458.3	 Like if steroid usage in baseball-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3459.1s	3459.1	 Totally, we need an investigation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3460.3s	3460.3	 I guess, in that 11 condition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3461.6s	3461.6	 And this goes back to Rebel News asking Burla a very simple question, which is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3466.9s	3466.9	 what did you know and when did you know with respect to the evidence that you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3470.2s	3470.2	 talking about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3470.8s	3470.8	 I think that we know with respect to the efficacy and safety of these vaccines,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3474.1s	3474.1	 if they did not tell the public that these vaccines did not work the way they were supposed to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3478.8s	3478.8	 because they want to keep minting money, that is a legitimate scandal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3481.9s	3481.9	 We have a right to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3483.0s	3483.0	 But Freeberg, let me ask you a question here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3484.8s	3484.8	 I think, you know, Chamath talked about this sort of sped up process to cut through red tape
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3491.1s	3491.1	 and get a vaccine to market more quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3493.7s	3493.7	 I personally actually think that that kind of process is fine for patients who want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3498.7s	3498.7	 as sort of a libertarian, I support that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3501.1s	3501.1	 But I go back to the fact that people in many places were not given a choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3506.4s	3506.4	 They had to get vaccinated or they could lose their job or their freedom to participate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3512.2s	3512.2	 in society.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3514.8s	3514.8	 And now we're finding out that they may have been forced to do something that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3518.2s	3518.2	 in their particular case, may not really have been a great cost benefit decision for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3524.1s	3524.1	 What do you think that the sort of impact is going to be of this just like socially?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3530.8s	3530.8	 I mean, you've talked about, I think that there's a decline in trust of institutional authority in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3537.6s	3537.6	 the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3538.8s	3538.8	 And that's a huge problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3539.9s	3539.9	 I mean, isn't this going to contribute to that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3542.1s	3542.1	 Yeah, look, I mean, I think that there's been institutional authority overreach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3547.6s	3547.6	 that's been building for quite some time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3550.0s	3550.0	 And, you know, look, I mean, you guys can go back to our first episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3553.5s	3553.5	 And our earliest episodes and I wasn't and haven't been and I think the first time I tweeted,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3559.4s	3559.4	 I tweeted about the adverse impact that lockdowns could have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3562.8s	3562.8	 And we should be weighing the cost of the lockdowns against the benefit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3566.3s	3566.3	 And ultimately, the benefit was zero because we ended up accumulating,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3570.4s	3570.4	 call it $10 trillion of, you know, $4 trillion of net costs that we have to pay off at some point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3577.0s	3577.0	 not to mention the economic consequences of the lockdowns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3581.1s	3581.1	 And, you know, the benefit was negligible because the virus continued to spread and evolve,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3586.7s	3586.7	 and there was no way to really stop the virus in its tracks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3590.7s	3590.7	 Hindsight is 2020. Fog of war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3593.7s	3593.7	 Lawmakers made decisions. Was it the right decision?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3596.7s	3596.7	 Would you have made the same decision?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3597.7s	3597.7	 It's really hard to say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3598.6s	3598.6	 You feel like you're saving the world when the world is ending.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3601.8s	3601.8	 It's easy to kind of act with some degree of what is now viewed as overreach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3606.7s	3606.7	 I do think that the mass vaccination requirement may have also been deemed overreach given the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3612.5s	3612.5	 limited data that was available and the rapid evolution that was pretty apparent in the virus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3616.7s	3616.7	 at the time as well. But vaccines are required for a number of other illnesses in a number of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3624.4s	3624.4	 school systems around the country. You know, you start to question, I think we will start to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3630.3s	3630.3	 people question whether those are appropriate. But again, those are longer studied, better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3634.8s	3634.8	 understood. The cost benefit analysis is much there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3639.3s	3639.3	 Yeah, actually, I think you're right that one of the costs of this policy is going to be that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3644.4s	3644.4	 people will stop trusting vaccination in general, even though I think that these COVID vaccines,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3651.9s	3651.9	 I'm not even sure you can really call them vaccines. I mean, every other vaccine that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3655.5s	3655.5	 I've ever heard of completely prevents that disease. The polio vaccine ended polio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3661.8s	3661.8	 The MMR vaccine ended measles, mumps and rubella. The COVID vaccine just didn't work. I don't think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3667.2s	3667.2	 it was a vaccine. But I think now what's going to happen is people are going to have a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3670.8s	3670.8	 more distrust. There's a tremendous amount of post-activity rationalization going on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3678.6s	3678.6	 where once you kind of made a statement that the vaccine will stop transmission of the virus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3684.0s	3684.0	 or stop hospitalizations, and suddenly it doesn't, and you've made that statement with such surety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3690.1s	3690.1	 and brevity and funded it with so much money and caused such cost in doing so, at that point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3696.3s	3696.3	 you're too far removed to go back and say, you know what, it doesn't. And as we're seeing now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3700.7s	3700.7	 the consequences of not being willing to say that you were wrong may be far greater than the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3706.6s	3706.6	 consequences of kind of continuing or kind of making this change. So it's-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3712.2s	3712.2	 Well, actually, that's a good point. All right, final question to J. Cal, then, on that point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3715.9s	3715.9	 So, I mean, J. Cal, look, you were dunking or at least concerned trolling on anti-vaxxers during
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3721.9s	3721.9	 this time period. Do you reconsider that at all? I mean, in other words, everybody was saying that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3726.9s	3726.9	 the anti-vaxxers were these stupid, unsophisticated people who-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3731.3s	3731.3	 Yeah, I think-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3733.1s	3733.1	 But maybe it was the elites who were the ones suffering from group think. I mean, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3737.9s	3737.9	 and I put myself in this bucket. We were all herded into this idea of being an early adopter of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3744.7s	3744.7	 product, and now we're finding out that it certainly didn't do what it said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3748.4s	3748.4	 Yeah, in fairness, we said we knew this was experimental. We knew this was the first time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3752.4s	3752.4	 mRNA, but we also knew like a billion people had gotten them or when we got ours, we knew
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3757.7s	3757.7	 hundreds of millions of people had gotten them and the mRNA, hold on, let me just- you asked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3761.2s	3761.2	 the question, so let me finish. And so I think people made a risk assessment knowing this was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3766.8s	3766.8	 an experimental vaccine, knowing that the COVID was mutating at the time. And yeah, it could have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3773.5s	3773.5	 been oversold. Of course, that seems to be the case. All right, Nick, pull up this tweet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3779.2s	3779.2	 But we need to, I think we have to look at, because we had this conversation, you and I,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3785.5s	3785.5	 of you were very much in favor of everybody getting the mandate and everybody being forced to get the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3794.0s	3794.0	 vaccine. No, no, no, I never supported the mandate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3796.0s	3796.0	 You did. We had a conversation about that. Like, should people be able to go to work? Should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3799.0s	3799.0	 people go on trains? And your position was people shouldn't be able to go on trains.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3803.5s	3803.5	 No, I did not support a mandate. I thought it should always be people's choice. I did believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3807.9s	3807.9	 that. Hold on, I made the mistake of believing the experts in the mainstream media. I think if the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3815.5s	3815.5	 last couple of years have taught us anything, it's that they can't be trusted. The level of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3819.1s	3819.1	 distrust we should have is even greater than we thought. I never supported a mandate because I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3822.8s	3822.8	 thought it should be people's choice. And I certainly wasn't, I don't think I was dunking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3828.1s	3828.1	 on the anti-vaxxers. Let's pull up this tweet, Nick. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3833.5s	3833.5	 My Lord, Trump has cronies of Fox News are killing their own constituents with this anti-vaxx nonsense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3838.7s	3838.7	 Yeah. Do you retract that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3844.5s	3844.5	 Do I retract it? I'm trying to look at the date.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3847.9s	3847.9	 By the way, this is a tweet that Jason put out. What was the date?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3852.0s	3852.0	 Jan 4th, 2022. That's actually pulled up just so people-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3856.0s	3856.0	 Yeah, that was only a year ago. Yeah, no, at this point, people were saying that-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3861.7s	3861.7	 No, I get it. I get it. Look, this is not a rare sentiment, but I'm saying-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3867.2s	3867.2	 No, no, but hold on just to give this- Do you still stand by this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3869.5s	3869.5	 Well, hold on a second. I'm just reading it. This was showing the deaths from COVID were happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3876.7s	3876.7	 at a magnitude more by people who didn't take the vaccine. And we know the vaccine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3883.3s	3883.3	 had reduced deaths. So we still know that, correct, Freeberg? The vaccine reduces the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3889.0s	3889.0	 cases of deaths, correct? Yeah, this new bivalent booster,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3893.6s	3893.6	 Eric Topol put out a tweet. I gave you guys the link here where he covered a paper that was done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3899.3s	3899.3	 recently. And the paper shows a reduction in hospitalization rate and death rate for folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3904.7s	3904.7	 that are getting this new bivalent booster. But again, that is a benefit-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3909.4s	3909.4	 That is the benefit, yeah. In one's own kind of personal safety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3912.7s	3912.7	 And there's a risk profile associated with that, as Sax is pointing out. But this notion that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3917.1s	3917.1	 vaccines stop the virus and are a true vaccine in the sense of how we talk about polio and chicken
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3922.7s	3922.7	 pox or smallpox and this other stuff, not equivalent. Very different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3927.9s	3927.9	 But Freeberg, wait, that data, how long after vaccination was that data? Because I thought
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3931.9s	3931.9	 that with respect to the vaccine, one of the big problems is that the benefits only last for two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3937.1s	3937.1	 months. Unless you're willing to get revaccinated every two months, then it's not really realistic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3943.2s	3943.2	 Generally speaking, this is not like a vaccine in the sense of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3949.6s	3949.6	 smallpox or- Right. This is a shot. It's a treatment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3953.4s	3953.4	 It's a modest muting of the effects, and it's one that people need to take kind of a risk-based
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3959.2s	3959.2	 decision on for one's personal thing. But having mandates on whether or not you can go to school
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3963.6s	3963.6	 and whether or not you can be in places and whether or not it's appropriate for workplace
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3969.5s	3969.5	 setting, there's still high degrees of infectiousness with this ever-evolving virus. The virus that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3973.9s	3973.9	 have today is not the virus that we had in February of 2020. It's a very different virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3979.7s	3979.7	 And it has evolved to such an extent now, and it's continuing to evolve,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3984.7s	3984.7	 that it's very difficult to say there's a vaccine for this virus. It's a-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3989.6s	3989.6	 But Jacob, why won't you just say that the so-called vaccine has been a failure?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3994.3s	3994.3	 Hold on. I'm going to admit- Hold on. It's a failure at-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=3997.2s	3997.2	 We don't know the full safety implications. Like I said, I don't want to get too far out of my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4002.1s	4002.1	 skis on that. However, we know the efficaciousness of it has been a failure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4006.6s	4006.6	 For what? For blocking transmission or for reducing death?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4007.3s	4007.3	 That it doesn't last long enough. Unless you're going to get- Hold on. Unless you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4011.0s	4011.0	 going to get jabbed six times a year, which I don't think anybody here would do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4015.1s	4015.1	 And nothing doesn't work. And probably not necessary because it's- Hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4018.8s	4018.8	 There was a time period where it was effective, correct, Friedberg, and it did reduce deaths
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4024.7s	4024.7	 massively. So I think that's the issue that we're talking about here is that now the COVID strains
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4029.1s	4029.1	 are so weak that maybe it's not as necessary. But there was a time period where people were not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4034.1s	4034.1	 taking the vaccine and Republicans specifically weren't taking the vaccine and they were dying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4039.3s	4039.3	 at a much higher percentage. So it didn't- If you're defining the vaccine as not transferring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4045.0s	4045.0	 the disease, sure it was a failure. It didn't block like we thought it would. But in terms of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4049.3s	4049.3	 reducing death, it did work for a period of time. If it only lasted for two months and COVID is still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4056.1s	4056.1	 around and it's basically endemic, it's everywhere, how did the vaccine make any difference whatsoever?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4061.1s	4061.1	 I think now it's two months, but back then it wasn't. But, you know, Friedberg-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4064.6s	4064.6	 Wait, Friedberg, is that true? What's the question? I'm losing track at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4069.7s	4069.7	 How long does the lowering the percentage of deaths-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4073.8s	4073.8	 The benefits of it only-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4075.3s	4075.3	 Yes, reducing the chance of death.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4077.4s	4077.4	 What we've learned is it only lasts two months. Is that true?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4079.5s	4079.5	 Yeah, it depends on the population. And yes, there is a decline in the benefit over time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4085.4s	4085.4	 as well as the fact that the virus is evolving. Those are both two kind of independent things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4090.2s	4090.2	 And as a result, over time, you know, like, yeah, we got to keep getting boosted or shots. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4094.9s	4094.9	 Pfizer's making a great business out of it. You're right. There's a massive economic incentive here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4099.1s	4099.1	 for them and Moderna to keep this gravy train rolling. And there's a massive incentive for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4103.9s	4103.9	 government officials, politicians to continue to stand by what they said before, because otherwise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4108.9s	4108.9	 they're going to be called wrong and they're going to get beat up for it. And they're not going to get reelected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4112.4s	4112.4	 I feel like you're making an effort to stand by what you previously said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4118.5s	4118.5	 I think we should just come out and say that, look, regardless of where the safety data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4121.9s	4121.9	 ultimately comes out, just based on efficaciousness, we can say that this thing didn't work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4126.9s	4126.9	 And therefore mandating it was even worse thing. Because hold on, we put the drug through this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4133.0s	4133.0	 rapid process, and we didn't let people make an individual cost benefit decision. We basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4138.5s	4138.5	 herded them into this. And at best, it didn't do very much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4142.8s	4142.8	 I don't think that that decision, if you make that conclusion, I'm not sure that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4147.1s	4147.1	 it gives us a toolkit to do better the next time. And I think we've all said this and Friedberg was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4153.1s	4153.1	 the one that first really taught us about this. There will be a next time, unfortunately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4158.0s	4158.0	 So I think that we have to focus our energy here in acknowledging that the tools that we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4166.4s	4166.4	 to create these messenger RNA vaccines and other types of solutions, we are pushing the boundaries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4172.3s	4172.3	 of science and the body is still very poorly understood. And so the sensitivity and specificity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4177.6s	4177.6	 of these drugs may not be what we think upfront. And as a result of that, maybe we need to find a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4184.7s	4184.7	 different way of using emergency use authorization in the future. And I don't know, David, to your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4191.9s	4191.9	 point, I'm beyond my ski tips on scientific knowledge to know how.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4197.7s	4197.7	 Right. Well, I'd say at a minimum, I would say as a minimum that if we're going to do emergency use,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4203.0s	4203.0	 it shouldn't be mandated. Let patients and doctors decide on their own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4206.5s	4206.5	 Okay, let's move on. So we have a moment of agreement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4208.6s	4208.6	 One question for Friedberg. Would you advise or in your life, would you continue to get a booster?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4215.5s	4215.5	 Or are you going to consider getting a booster every year?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4217.9s	4217.9	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4218.3s	4218.3	 If they keep coming with them? And now would you advise parents or, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4222.7s	4222.7	 adults over 65 or 70 to get one? Because those seem to be the high risk group, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4227.2s	4227.2	 So if your parents said, should I get it or not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4230.1s	4230.1	 I would advise them to talk to their doctor and their doctor would advise them to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4233.9s	4233.9	 What do you think most doctors would tell somebody above 65 or 70 at this point?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4238.6s	4238.6	 It depends what state they're in at this point. But like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4241.7s	4241.7	 basically would be split on political lines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4244.5s	4244.5	 Unless this virus turns into Ebola, I'm never getting boosted again. I'll tell you that right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4249.6s	4249.6	 I do agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4250.7s	4250.7	 What about you guys?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4252.0s	4252.0	 I'm not getting boosted again. No, I'm not getting boosted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4254.3s	4254.3	 I think that speaks volumes. That's volumes right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4256.7s	4256.7	 That's why I asked it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4257.5s	4257.5	 That's it. That's it. Like we could have just done this in 10 seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4261.5s	4261.5	 Guys, we are literally not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4262.7s	4262.7	 I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4263.1s	4263.1	 This show will be big on every platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4264.3s	4264.3	 All right. Let's move on. Let's move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4265.6s	4265.6	 No, we're not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4266.3s	4266.3	 Hold on. Freeberg, but the fact that all of us can arrive at that and then we're worried
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4270.9s	4270.9	 about getting banned tells you how screwed up our society is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4275.9s	4275.9	 Like what? We can't like have an honest conversation about this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4279.1s	4279.1	 By the way, the other thing this is going to do, it's going to inflame a large number of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4282.3s	4282.3	 just hearing us say this. And because people have these deep, what's happened is this has now become
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4287.3s	4287.3	 a sense of identity, a sense of tribalism and a sense of it's a belief system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4291.0s	4291.0	 It's no longer about an objective decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4292.9s	4292.9	 Well, we saw this with the mass. The mass became the blue, became the blue equivalent of the red
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4297.4s	4297.4	 maga hat. And the vaccine is basically, you know, it's become tribal. But that's not going to, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4303.8s	4303.8	 people need to move beyond that because this is a scientific question of cost and benefits related
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4308.7s	4308.7	 to this medical treatment. Okay. Let's just move on. There's too much other stuff to talk about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4313.1s	4313.1	 There's not for venture capitalists about your vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4317.3s	4317.3	 I agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4317.9s	4317.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4318.3s	4318.3	 Speak to your doctor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4319.2s	4319.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4319.5s	4319.5	 Speak to your doctor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4320.3s	4320.3	 Please don't listen to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4321.6s	4321.6	 All right. Let's move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4323.9s	4323.9	 We're as confused as you are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4324.6s	4324.6	 By the way, by the way, speak to your doctor and just remember, vaccine manufacturers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4329.3s	4329.3	 have a business to run and politicians have to get reelected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4332.0s	4332.0	 All right. Let's move on because we've got to stuck on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4334.8s	4334.8	 Okay. Look, there's been some important developments in Ukraine. I think we should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4337.3s	4337.3	 just cover quickly this week. There were a bunch of things. The Biden administration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4340.8s	4340.8	 said they're going to send Abrams tanks as well as Bradley's and Leopard 2s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4346.2s	4346.2	 The Abrams tank in particular is our best, most expensive tank. At the beginning of the war,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4351.6s	4351.6	 they said they would not send them, so they reversed their decision on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4355.0s	4355.0	 Now the Ukrainians are saying they want jets as well. That's the next issue that's going to come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4359.2s	4359.2	 up. The Biden administration also in a New York Times article that came out earlier this week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4364.5s	4364.5	 said that they were warming to the idea of supporting an invasion of Crimea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4371.0s	4371.0	 Some Europeans like Peter Hitchens are getting very nervous about this level of escalation. He
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4375.5s	4375.5	 had a pretty amazing piece talking about the risk of this creating nuclear war. Even if the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4381.5s	4381.5	 Ukrainians prevail in this war, there was a really interesting statement by Larry Fink
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4387.2s	4387.2	 at Davos last week saying that he estimated the cost of reconstruction at $750 billion and Fitch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4394.1s	4394.1	 ratings agency says that Ukraine is headed towards default. Major, major developments,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4400.0s	4400.0	 I think, in the war this week. I want to get your guys' opinion on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4404.8s	4404.8	 We know from history that wars tend to escalate and to be far more costly than the participants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4410.5s	4410.5	 ever thought. Is that the track we're on now? In hindsight, knowing what we know now, should we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4416.7s	4416.7	 regret that we didn't use every diplomatic tool we had to prevent the war, most notably taking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4421.3s	4421.3	 NATO expansion off the table? Freiburg, I'll go to you. It's such a tough situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4429.4s	4429.4	 Well, just is the situation escalating to a point where we should be concerned?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4434.4s	4434.4	 You know, there's a lot of information we don't have and there's a lot of intelligence gathering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4440.3s	4440.3	 and conversations and chatter that we're not privy to. So to sit here and kind of be an armchair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4448.1s	4448.1	 mechanic on this stuff, I don't know what diplomatic conversations have gone on or are going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4455.1s	4455.1	 All I know is what we're reading on the internet, right? So I don't have a primary...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4461.5s	4461.5	 This war is extremely well covered and there are no diplomatic conversations going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4468.0s	4468.0	 We are escalating the war. Let me get J. Keller Trimoth in here. Do you guys have any concerns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4472.9s	4472.9	 about the direction this is headed at all? Yes, I'm concerned. I also agree with Freiburg that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4478.6s	4478.6	 I don't think we have all the information, but I'm not exactly sure what we can do right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4485.5s	4485.5	 It seems like they have decided that there is a play to exert a lot of pressure come the spring,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4493.7s	4493.7	 and that's something that you've mentioned as a very likely thing. And so I guess the calculus on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4499.5s	4499.5	 the ground is that there's a way to really push Russia into a corner. And the only way to do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4505.4s	4505.4	 is with more military support. And then on the heels of that, David, the link that you sent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4512.8s	4512.8	 is then it's not just the war machine that is now spinning up, but it's the aftermarket
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4518.7s	4518.7	 financial services infrastructure that's also spinning up. Or Larry Fink would like-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4522.4s	4522.4	 You mean the grift aspect of this war?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4524.1s	4524.1	 Well, yeah. Where Larry Fink was like, hey, they're going to need three quarters of a trillion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4528.5s	4528.5	 dollars of reconstruction support. We saw that play out in Iraq as well, where at first it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4534.5s	4534.5	 the war machine and then it was the reconstruction machine and together it was trillions and trillions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4538.9s	4538.9	 By the way, you know what that's called? Those are called infrastructure funds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4542.8s	4542.8	 And those infrastructure funds raise hundreds of billions of dollars to make investments,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4547.5s	4547.5	 to build new infrastructure in markets that need it and that are willing to pay for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4551.6s	4551.6	 And it will likely end up being kind of long-term debt assumed by that region
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4555.5s	4555.5	 to pay to do this work. And the beneficiaries will be the investors and owners of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4559.9s	4559.9	 infrastructure funds. I think there's two sides to this, that are worth kind of noting. One is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4564.5s	4564.5	 the telegraphing of this decision because it's not being done secretly. It's being done out in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4569.1s	4569.1	 open. There's certainly a calculus to that. Why are they telegraphing this and what do they intend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4574.5s	4574.5	 to do with that messaging being put out there like this? And it may be that it's to assert or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4581.6s	4581.6	 assume a stronger negotiating position, certainly to go into some sort of mild modest exit or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4587.4s	4587.4	 settlement coming out of this thing. But you're right. The flip side is, and the cost here is one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4591.8s	4591.8	 of extreme outcome, which is there may be a France-Ferdenand moment here where one thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4598.1s	4598.1	 goes too far and triggers a cataclysmic outcome. And in this case, the cataclysmic outcome is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4604.4s	4604.4	 tactical nuclear weapons. And tactical nuclear weapons, as we've talked about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4610.1s	4610.1	 and I think I had some conversations and some dinners I shared with you guys with some folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4615.4s	4615.4	 in the intelligence community. And this has been talked about by ex-intelligence community folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4619.4s	4619.4	 publicly, are a key part of the Russian war playbook. That there is a tactical nuclear weapon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4626.9s	4626.9	 response system that is in place. And these are very possible paths that we could find ourselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4634.9s	4634.9	 kind of walking down. Obviously, were that to happen, it would be a massive escalation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4639.4s	4639.4	 And you're right, there could be a France-Ferdenand kind of moment that emerges by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4644.3s	4644.3	 shaking the cage and lighting a fire. And there may be a stronger negotiating position to get to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4649.9s	4649.9	 a settlement faster by doing this. I don't have a strong point of view on the probability of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4654.8s	4654.8	 either of those and why, but I think maybe both are certainly in play here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4660.0s	4660.0	 Yeah. It was interesting to me that the Wall Street Journal on the heels of all of this stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4663.8s	4663.8	 also published an article about Roman Abramovich. And the interesting thing about it was a quote in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4670.2s	4670.2	 the article that effectively said something tantamount to, well, now that he's proven not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4675.1s	4675.1	 as useful, we need to target him with sanctions. So I just think that what all of this is, is now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4684.5s	4684.5	 sort of they're entering the end game, David, to use a chess analogy. And it looks like they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4691.4s	4691.4	 setting the wheels in motion to kind of put all the pieces together for a negotiated settlement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4699.9s	4699.9	 Do we know that? I mean, well, but is it the end game or is it continual escalation? I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4704.2s	4704.2	 J. Cal, at the beginning of the war, we didn't want to give the Ukrainians Abram's tanks because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4708.6s	4708.6	 they were, that was considered too provocative. Now we're giving them to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4713.5s	4713.5	 I think what's going on here is, and I suspected this, you know, from the beginning is that we are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4719.8s	4719.8	 trying to engage them in a war of attrition, and it's working. And so I think the West,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4725.5s	4725.5	 collectively, is trying to further that goal of just making Russia economically, politically,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4731.2s	4731.2	 militarily, culturally irrelevant or angled in some way. And if you think about what's now happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4737.9s	4737.9	 with energy, you know, his primary export, he is going to lose those customers and his customers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4744.3s	4744.3	 will be, you know, bottom feeding India, China, low cost, you know, oil and he is going to be a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4751.0s	4751.0	 pariah. So what I'm looking at is if there's going to be a negotiated settlement this year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4754.2s	4754.2	 what is the next five or 10 years going to look like for Russia? What is their place in the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4758.3s	4758.3	 going to be? The West is never going to trust them again. The Germans are never going to buy their oil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4762.6s	4762.6	 again. Everybody is going to be looking for ways to distance themselves from. So how does he have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4767.4s	4767.4	 an exit ramp? And we talked about this from the get go here on this podcast is what's the golden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4772.1s	4772.1	 bridge for him to retreat across. And we really need to find that golden bridge quickly, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4777.9s	4777.9	 I do think this is starting to look desperate for him. The West keeps giving better and better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4782.3s	4782.3	 munitions. He keeps losing economically, he's going to keep losing. And politically, who would ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4789.2s	4789.2	 want to engage Putin in anything with, you know, any kind of cultural or international trade,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4795.3s	4795.3	 it's going to be a disaster for him. So this war of attrition has to resolve itself with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4802.9s	4802.9	 some sort of settlement. But we can't go on for two or three years, can it? I mean, it has to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4807.5s	4807.5	 settle at some point. I think that it certainly can go on. And I think that history proves that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4813.5s	4813.5	 wars tend to escalate and the costs incurred are much greater, in many cases than participants ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4820.1s	4820.1	 dreamed of. And if they had to go and do it all over again, they wouldn't have gotten into it in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4824.3s	4824.3	 the first place. So yeah, I think this is concerning. I think, you know, the crazy thing is-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4830.2s	4830.2	 Do you think it is a war of attrition strategy? Do you think that's the-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4832.3s	4832.3	 Yeah, I think it has developed into a war of attrition. And I think you're right that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4837.5s	4837.5	 well, I think- Do you think that was by design?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4839.8s	4839.8	 I think there's two possibilities, J. Cal. I think that the, maybe the more cynical or realistic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4845.7s	4845.7	 members of the administration think there's benefit in wearing Russia down and grinding them down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4851.1s	4851.1	 However, I also think there's kind of a true believer camp that sees pushing Russia out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4856.3s	4856.3	 Ukraine, nothing less than that will do. And we have to punish their aggression. Maybe they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4860.9s	4860.9	 want regime change. I think there's dueling factions in the administration. Remember,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4864.3s	4864.3	 General Milley several months ago said that everything that the Ukrainians could achieve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4868.8s	4868.8	 militarily just about had been done and they should negotiate. And even Jake Sullivan had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4873.7s	4873.7	 said that they should take Crimea off the table. That was just the leaks a few months ago. Now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4878.9s	4878.9	 the administration is leaking that they're going to support a Crimean invasion. So I think there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4884.3s	4884.3	 both schools within the administration, the true believers and the more cynical folks. And it feels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4890.8s	4890.8	 to me like the true believers are on top right now because we just keep escalating this war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4896.2s	4896.2	 more and more. And I think that's dangerous. That polarizes the outcomes, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4900.9s	4900.9	 So I think, J. Cal, if you had your way, it sounds like you would grind the Russians down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4904.7s	4904.7	 but at a certain point you would say enough is enough. And like a poker player, like you do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4910.2s	4910.2	 at the poker table, you'd say have won my prius for the night. I don't need to risk that to win
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4916.2s	4916.2	 a Tesla. So I'm going to cash in my chips and get away, walk up, walk away, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4921.0s	4921.0	 J. Cal Lambsot Yeah, I wish I could do that. I wish I could do that consistently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4925.1s	4925.1	 J. Cal Lambsot Yeah, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4926.4s	4926.4	 J. Cal Lambsot Getting up from the table is a rare skill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4928.8s	4928.8	 J. Cal Lambsot That's right. But I'm not sure the administration's getting up from the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4932.5s	4932.5	 I mean, I think we've achieved the American position on this, I think has largely been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4937.7s	4937.7	 achieved. We've prevented Russia from taking over Ukraine. We've prevented, we've basically shifted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4944.3s	4944.3	 Europe onto American natural gas. We've destroyed Nord Stream. I think we're close to achieving our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4950.0s	4950.0	 major objectives, but I'm not sure we're going to stop there. Anyway, all right, let's move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4957.7s	4957.7	 Friedberg, you have a Science Corner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4958.7s	4958.7	 Friedberg I was going to share the, this was last week, I think we talked about talking about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4964.7s	4964.7	 this week. So there was a paper that is a pretty compelling paper published by a team led out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4972.0s	4972.0	 Harvard on identifying what may be the core driver of aging and demonstration on an ability to kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4982.0s	4982.0	 of reverse aging. So I'll just start really quickly that, you know, in the human body,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4987.8s	4987.8	 we have many different types of cells, right? We have 200 roughly different kinds of cells,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4991.9s	4991.9	 an eye cell, a skin cell, a brain cell, a heart cell. They all have the same DNA, the same genetic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=4997.7s	4997.7	 code, the same genome at the nucleus of that cell. What makes those cells different, and the reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5002.7s	5002.7	 they act and behave differently is they have different gene expression, meaning different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5007.9s	5007.9	 genes in that cell are turned on and off. And when a gene is turned on, the protein that that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5013.8s	5013.8	 gene codes for is expressed and made in the cell. And the genes that are off those proteins are not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5018.7s	5018.7	 made. And remember, proteins are the biochemical machines in biology. So when certain proteins are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5023.9s	5023.9	 produced, they do stuff and other proteins don't do stuff and the cell acts and behaves very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5028.0s	5028.0	 differently. So some cells, when you turn genes on and off, you get a neuron. Some cells, you turn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5032.7s	5032.7	 them on and off, you get a muscle cell in your bicep. Some of them you get a heart cell. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5037.1s	5037.1	 all of these cells are differentiated by the genes that are expressed. The general term for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5044.0s	5044.0	 the expression of genes is the epigenome. And an epigenome basically refers to these systems whereby
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5052.1s	5052.1	 there's certain parts of the DNA, certain segments of genes are uncoiled a little bit. So if you zoom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5059.5s	5059.5	 in on DNA, you know, there's 23 chromosomes, they're tightly wrapped in these coils. And when you go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5065.7s	5065.7	 even closer, you see that there's these segments called nucleosomes. And a nucleosome means it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5069.8s	5069.8	 like a bead and a bunch of DNA is wrapped around the bead. And how closely those beads are together,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5074.8s	5074.8	 how much the DNA is wrapped allows a segment of the DNA to be opened up and then expressed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5080.6s	5080.6	 meaning copies of the DNA are turned into RNA, which floats into this thing called the ribosome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5086.3s	5086.3	 And the ribosome is the protein printer. So the more these little segments of genome are exposed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5090.9s	5090.9	 the more they're expressed. And there are certain chemicals, these methyls and acetyls that kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5095.3s	5095.3	 attach to the genome and certain elements that allow parts of the chromosome to wrap up and get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5101.4s	5101.4	 really tightly bound or to unwrap and to express the gene. So the epigenome is almost you can think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5107.8s	5107.8	 about it like the software. And the genome or the DNA is the hardware. And so the hardware basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5113.9s	5113.9	 defines what you can make. The epigenome defines what is being made, what stuff is turned on and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5118.3s	5118.3	 what stuff is turned off. So this paper and this work that was done, historically, we've always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5123.7s	5123.7	 thought that aging meant that over time, the DNA in our cells was mutating and errors were accumulating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5129.3s	5129.3	 in the DNA. And as a result of those errors, the cells start to dysfunction. And what these guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5134.8s	5134.8	 really did a good job of proving with this paper is that it may not be mutations in the DNA that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5139.9s	5139.9	 causing aging, but actually changes in the epigenome and that the DNA remains pretty stable and pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5145.9s	5145.9	 consistent over time. And the way they did this is they broke the DNA. And just so you guys know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5151.0s	5151.0	 every second of your life, about a million breaks in DNA in cells throughout your body are happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5157.0s	5157.0	 Your DNA is being broken up and then there's all this machinery in your cell that fixes the DNA when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5161.7s	5161.7	 it breaks. Now, what happens when it fixes it, it turns out it's actually really good at fixing it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5166.6s	5166.6	 and the DNA doesn't change. And we historically thought that the DNA changed a lot and mutations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5171.1s	5171.1	 accumulate over time. But in reality, what may be happening is as your DNA gets fixed, the epigenome,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5177.9s	5177.9	 the acetyl and methyl groups on the gene, on the chromosome, don't get put in the right place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5185.3s	5185.3	 And over time, what happens is the epigenome degrades. And this is considered, and a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5190.7s	5190.7	 people refer to this now, as the information theory of aging. You can kind of think about making a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5194.9s	5194.9	 of copies of software, a lot of copies of a photo and a photo printer over time. And every time you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5200.0s	5200.0	 make a copy, there's a little error, a little error, and those errors accumulate. And the errors that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5204.3s	5204.3	 accumulate cause the epigenome to change. And as a result, certain genes are turned on that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5209.2s	5209.2	 supposed to be off and certain genes are turned off that are supposed to be turned on. And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5213.9s	5213.9	 those cells start to get dysfunctional because the wrong proteins are being made in the cell can no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5218.7s	5218.7	 longer do what it's supposed to do. So what these guys... Could it be the ribosome as well that gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5223.9s	5223.9	 screwed up over time, the printer? The ribosome is a pretty static protein. It just does its thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5231.5s	5231.5	 And there's hundreds of ribosomes in a cell. So if one of them is dysfunctional, it just doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5235.9s	5235.9	 do anything. And then the other ones kind of step in and do it. So the ribosomes are constantly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5239.3s	5239.3	 running. What these guys did is they basically took two mice, two populations of mice, and they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5245.3s	5245.3	 gave the one population of mice a certain thing that caused its DNA to break at three times the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5251.1s	5251.1	 rate of the other population. And then as the DNA broke, they could see that this mouse population
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5257.5s	5257.5	 got older and older faster and by a bunch of measures on how do you measure age. But what they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5263.1s	5263.1	 did is they then sequenced the DNA of the two populations of mice. And what they showed is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5268.9s	5268.9	 the older mice, the ones that had their DNA changing a lot... By the way, these were genetically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5273.9s	5273.9	 identical mice. The ones that had their DNA broken a lot more, they had the correct genome. Their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5279.5s	5279.5	 genome was the exact same as the other mice that stayed young. And so what that tells us is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5285.1s	5285.1	 it's the epigenome and not the DNA itself that's changing. So then here's what they did. Remember
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5291.1s	5291.1	 last year we talked about Yamanaka factors, which are these four proteins, these four molecules that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5295.6s	5295.6	 can be applied to DNA, to a cell, and they cause all of the gene expression to reset back to looking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5302.8s	5302.8	 like a stem cell. And remember all of those differentiated cells come from a stem cell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5307.1s	5307.1	 And when they did that, the older population of mice suddenly started to act younger and all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5312.5s	5312.5	 the measures of age reversed. And they did this across different tissue types. They measured this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5317.5s	5317.5	 in a lot of different ways, cognitive function, health, cellular health, et cetera. And so it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5323.9s	5323.9	 not just a fantastic new proof point of how Yamanaka factors can actually reverse age,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5329.4s	5329.4	 but it demonstrates that the epigenome itself is what is the core driver of aging. And you guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5336.1s	5336.1	 remember Altos Labs raised $3 billion in a seed round last year. And remember at the end of 21,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5340.9s	5340.9	 I said like Yamanaka factors and aging research is going to be kind of the next hot thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5344.7s	5344.7	 I think this paper is going to be one of the seminal papers that really kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5348.4s	5348.4	 illustrates and proves the point that this epigenome is the driver of aging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5353.1s	5353.1	 And as we now are investing a lot of money in figuring out how Yamanaka factors and other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5357.9s	5357.9	 transcription factors like the Yamanaka factors can be applied in specific ways to actually reverse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5363.2s	5363.2	 aging and cause the cells to start functioning correctly again. And then people will start to act
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5368.3s	5368.3	 and resolve in a healthy way. Once again, there's a lot of work to go between here and there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5373.9s	5373.9	 but now we have a much more kind of definitive proof point that this information theory of aging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5377.5s	5377.5	 may be real, that it's tied to the epigenome and that there are solutions that can work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5382.3s	5382.3	 And we have to figure out how to put them together and how to engineer fantastic outcomes. So really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5387.0s	5387.0	 great paper by a team led out of Harvard, I think really validates a lot of the work and the money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5392.4s	5392.4	 that's going into the space, both in the public and the private sector. And obviously a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5397.5s	5397.5	 new startups kind of chasing this opportunity to figure out how we can use these transcription
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5401.6s	5401.6	 factors to reverse aging and that this may end up leading us to a much kind of healthy life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5407.5s	5407.5	 And by the way, when they applied those Yamanaka factors to the mice, the mice lived 107% longer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5413.9s	5413.9	 than they were supposed to, but more importantly, the health span as it's defined improved. So the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5418.8s	5418.8	 mice not only lived longer, but they actually lived healthier. All the measures of healthiness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5423.5s	5423.5	 in the body improved. So it's a really kind of powerful indicator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5426.3s	5426.3	 Is this going to help us in the next 10 years?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5428.7s	5428.7	 It may. Yeah, it's very well made. There are now some therapeutic...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5432.5s	5432.5	 I want to have a requirement. Is that how long they gave you sacks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5435.2s	5435.2	 They gave you time. No, Science Corner, I feel like Science
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5437.7s	5437.7	 Corner should only discuss things that can happen in the next few years, let's put it that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5443.0s	5443.0	 Or is that the wrong way to look at it? I'll tell you one thing for sure. You can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5446.6s	5446.6	 make money as an investor over the next 10 years in finding the right teams that are going to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5450.4s	5450.4	 the highest likelihood of progressing clinical trials in this space. I will say that there may
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5454.3s	5454.3	 be clinical trials that can come to market really fast, particularly with these ex vivo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5458.6s	5458.6	 therapeutics where you take cells out of your body, apply the Yamanaka factors, and then put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5462.7s	5462.7	 them back in your body for certain tissue types like eye cells, for example, or T cells in your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5467.1s	5467.1	 blood. There's a lot of ways that this may come to market faster. And it's not just about reversing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5471.3s	5471.3	 your age overall, but reversing the age of certain cell types in your body that can then have profound
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5476.2s	5476.2	 health impacts in the near term. So that's the kind of stuff that's going to start to come through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5479.5s	5479.5	 clinical stage sooner than later. And then maybe some number of years down the road,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5484.3s	5484.3	 we figure out a way to reverse the age in all the cells in our body and the whole body becomes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5488.0s	5488.0	 more youthful. But for now, it's going to be targeted cells in a very specific way to reverse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5492.3s	5492.3	 aging and improve health. Very powerful, very interesting, lots of investment opportunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5498.1s	5498.1	 And certainly some very smart folks. What do you think the realistic time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5503.5s	5503.5	 frame is for like, you know, reversing aging? Because we need that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5510.5s	5510.5	 30 years? Yeah. But I think I'll be 80.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5516.3s	5516.3	 No, but that's when you'll need it the most. But so, so if we live to 80, does that mean we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5523.0s	5523.0	 going to be able to like live to a hundred because we'll be able to like reverse age?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5526.4s	5526.4	 Well, it depends. Can you live well to a hundred? I think that's the question. We don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5531.8s	5531.8	 But if you could reverse aging. Yeah, but we don't know what that means,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5536.5s	5536.5	 because there's all kinds of things that you inherit over time that this may not, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5540.7s	5540.7	 like if you have long-term heart disease, I could see how the cells could get healthier,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5545.9s	5545.9	 but it can't eliminate the plaque in your arteries. Right. You know, that's calcium.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5552.3s	5552.3	 That's right. That shit's there. So you have to live well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5582.7s	5582.7	 older. Those are things that I think are like short-term solutions. But no, to be honest with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5587.3s	5587.3	 you, Sachs, the stuff that really can screw you, which is heart disease and brain function,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5592.7s	5592.7	 this probably won't do much for a long time. So J.K.L. screwed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5597.2s	5597.2	 Yeah. I'm in the best shape I've been in 20 years. I feel great. Can you reverse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5602.1s	5602.1	 whatever is wrong with J.K.L. or is that in the plaque category? Can I do a quality of life shout

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5611.0s	5611.0	 from a guy who I won't say just to not to violate his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5614.7s	5614.7	 privacy, privacy. But he's in Saskatchewan. He listens to the pod or his father is and made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5621.9s	5621.9	 him get a prenuvo scan, flew the father to Vancouver. They found a five centimeter cancerous tumor on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5628.1s	5628.1	 his kidney. And three days ago had it removed and looks like guys totally healthy and well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5635.5s	5635.5	 eliminated. Here's thing. So another live saved. But I wanted to show you guys a picture. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5641.9s	5641.9	 yesterday I went to Los Angeles to see my interventional cardiologist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5647.1s	5647.1	 And what they do is they do what's called a contrast CT scan. So they put you into an IV
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5652.3s	5652.3	 and they put this contrast inside of you. Nick, do you want to throw the picture up, please?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5657.1s	5657.1	 And then they use all the software to actually create an extremely accurate 3D model of your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5662.2s	5662.2	 heart. And what they can do is go inside of your arteries and actually measure the calcium build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5667.9s	5667.9	 up. I've mentioned this before this this is a service called heart flow H E A R T F L O W.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5677.1s	5677.1	 In any event, my calcium score is still zero. Thank God touch wood, keep grinding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5683.1s	5683.1	 But I just wanted to put this out there for anybody who has a history of heart disease in

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5693.9s	5693.9	 this is a third party service that they can do it, you go get a contrast CT. And you can get a very

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5711.9s	5711.9	 Because all of us we try to find if you had a heart for all this 112 episodes. Dr. Carlsberg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5717.7s	5717.7	 was shocked. They found a heart. It looked huge. It looked like secretariat. He's got a big heart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5723.9s	5723.9	 Yeah. Yeah. I do have a big heart boys as you guys know. No, I mean, this is shocking for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5730.5s	5730.5	 audience. All of us are actual size. That can't be actual size. His heart's bigger than this brain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5734.8s	5734.8	 He's got a big heart. Glad you're healthy bestie. That's fantastic. So go get go get a heart flow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5740.9s	5740.9	 If anybody has heart disease, go talk to your doctor. All right. Well, for David Sachs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5745.5s	5745.5	 was the moderation okay? Yeah, I mean, listen, it was funny as if you were doing it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5751.1s	5751.1	 Jake. All right, fairness. I'll come back to moderate next week. I'll moderate. I'll be honest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5755.4s	5755.4	 with you. I would give both the Davids a robotic B minus C plus. I think they're better off opining
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5764.5s	5764.5	 than moderating. Okay. And I think that Jason really doesn't have anything interesting to say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5769.6s	5769.6	 So he's better off moderating. I don't know what it's like my comments last week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5774.4s	5774.4	 And then we can minimize the number of times he finds any random way to take it back to virtue

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5786.7s	5786.7	 49ers game where Kittle was an ineligible downfield receiver and they didn't call a penalty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5792.3s	5792.3	 Very important catch for that game that again, the Cowboys now losing every single time they get to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5797.1s	5797.1	 the playoffs. But I didn't want to ask you because I thought that you'd veer it toward Xi Jinping and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5802.5s	5802.5	 some China comment. No. Any genuflecting would you like to do before you go back to your-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5809.7s	5809.7	 I will admit that the moderation thing is harder than it looks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5814.5s	5814.5	 Well, it's harder than it looks to be entertaining. I think that's the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQMMzoeH9s&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=9&t=5818.7s	5818.7	 I think Jake is the last one to not check a job.
