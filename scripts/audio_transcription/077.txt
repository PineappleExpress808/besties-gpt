https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=273.6s	273.6	 Thanks for having me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=274.6s	274.6	 This is awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=275.6s	275.6	 I listen to your show every week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=276.6s	276.6	 Oh, thanks for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=277.6s	277.6	 So I guess, you know, the topic we all have talked about a whole bunch is work and keeping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=285.4s	285.4	 people focused at work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=287.0s	287.0	 You took a very bold step, which Toby A. Chappavai, I think, followed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=290.4s	290.4	 You said, listen, if you're coming to work, our mission is crypto.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=295.1s	295.1	 Can we stop talking about every other thing in the world and just stay focused on that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=299.6s	299.6	 And I think that was maybe, was that a year and a half ago?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=303.4s	303.4	 Something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=304.4s	304.4	 You did that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=306.1s	306.1	 Everybody wants to know how that worked out for the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=309.4s	309.4	 So maybe you could tell us what it was like to go through that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=312.2s	312.2	 Because, I mean, you were a target for a period of time, we all thought seems reasonable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=318.5s	318.5	 And then how has that actually impacted day to day life for the people who decided to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=323.8s	323.8	 opt into working at a single focused coinbase?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=327.1s	327.1	 Yeah, so I would say, you know, short term, it was quite a painful transition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=330.8s	330.8	 I think it created a lot of consternation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=332.7s	332.7	 There was some folks in the media decided to go call a bunch of people who'd left the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=336.5s	336.5	 company and write hit pieces and all that kind of thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=340.1s	340.1	 And frankly, about 5% of the company opted into the exit package.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=343.5s	343.5	 So there was some teams that were shorthanded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=345.1s	345.1	 A lot of people had to work extra time to fill in the gaps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=347.9s	347.9	 But long term, I think it turned out to be an incredibly positive decision for the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=352.3s	352.3	 I do think there's a lot of companies in Silicon Valley right now and probably elsewhere is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=355.7s	355.7	 that, you know, the CEOs and the management team almost feel like they're being held
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=359.9s	359.9	 hostage by employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=362.0s	362.0	 And I feel for some of these organizations, you know, Sundar probably has an incredibly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=365.5s	365.5	 difficult job right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=366.6s	366.6	 We saw that video from Microsoft, I think last year with Satya and kind of was with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=371.8s	371.8	 people talking about their hair color and stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=373.6s	373.6	 And they don't feel like that they can really lean in and move the company in the direction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=378.3s	378.3	 they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=379.3s	379.3	 And they're fearful of kind of all these internal dynamics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=382.9s	382.9	 So you know, I think there's probably a better way to do it than what I did, which is if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=386.4s	386.4	 you're starting a company today, just make that clear upfront.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=389.0s	389.0	 I didn't make it clear upfront.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=390.1s	390.1	 And so the company culture started to diverge and drift.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=393.5s	393.5	 And I had to kind of realign it, which was a painful process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=396.5s	396.5	 If I was doing it over again, I'd probably just set that as the expectation upfront and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=400.0s	400.0	 then there wouldn't be this, you know, public awkward realignment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=403.6s	403.6	 But yeah, I think I'm really glad that I did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=406.1s	406.1	 I think Coinbase has been very productive since then.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=408.8s	408.8	 And we've been able to attract a lot of the best and brightest people from some of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=411.7s	411.7	 other companies that are like, I don't want to be in those companies anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=414.4s	414.4	 I want to work at a company where we just focus on the work and the mission because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=416.9s	416.9	 that's actually important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=418.5s	418.5	 So I'd say it's been positive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=420.0s	420.0	 Brian, I've always talked about this as being like the difference between a hard culture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=423.6s	423.6	 and a soft culture, where hard cultures are companies that really define what they do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=429.7s	429.7	 and what they don't do and what they spend time on and what they don't spend time on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=433.9s	433.9	 And sometimes what you don't spend time on can relate to products.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=436.5s	436.5	 Sometimes it can relate to things outside or externalities to the business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=439.9s	439.9	 Do you think that that's become kind of a trend where, you know, soft culture in Silicon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=445.1s	445.1	 Valley is more about appeasing a very fickle employee base.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=450.0s	450.0	 And as a result, you kind of aren't as clear about what you're not going to talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=453.8s	453.8	 and are going to talk about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=454.6s	454.6	 And suddenly the troops rule the day and things get kind of sidetracked and productivity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=459.3s	459.3	 goes down. I mean, can you talk a little bit about what you've seen, you know, with other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=463.4s	463.4	 cultures around the valley and how that's kind of affecting work and what employees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=467.3s	467.3	 are choosing to go to and not go to?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=468.9s	468.9	 Yeah. So I think, you know, Ben Horowitz always talked about wartime CEO, peacetime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=473.5s	473.5	 CEO. And frankly, you know, I'm kind of a conflict avoidant person, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=477.0s	477.0	 I never thought of myself as like wartime CEO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=479.3s	479.3	 We're just like, we're all going in this direction. Let's go, go, go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=481.9s	481.9	 You know, I never really thought of myself like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=484.0s	484.0	 But I think what I'm trying to do now is find the happy medium between these two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=487.9s	487.9	 So the company should have a really ambitious mission.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=491.3s	491.3	 And then I think you as a CEO, you do have to say no to things which are off track from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=496.0s	496.0	 that. You do have to part ways with people who are not helping raise the talent bar in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=500.0s	500.0	 the company. And so in some ways you have to be, I guess, hard in that sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=504.4s	504.4	 But I don't think it's it's not like, you know, we're all here to make money and it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=508.9s	508.9	 like it's bonus time or you're out or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=510.9s	510.9	 It's like we actually have a much softer culture than that, I think, in Silicon Valley,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=513.6s	513.6	 which is most of the missions of these companies are trying to do great humanitarian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=517.6s	517.6	 efforts and they're trying to improve the biggest problems in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=520.7s	520.7	 And so people sign up for those because they want to have a real impact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=524.3s	524.3	 And, you know, we take time to like go for exec offsites and we walk in nature and we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=529.1s	529.1	 have like coaching, we do all this touchy feely stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=531.2s	531.2	 So I think it's kind of a mix of both is the right balance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=535.6s	535.6	 I don't think of myself as like, you know, a Wall Street hedge fund or like the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=540.3s	540.3	 touchy feely culture you can imagine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=541.9s	541.9	 Why do you think companies now have sort of veered into this place where they have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=545.9s	545.9	 kind of appease these fringes on either side?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=549.2s	549.2	 Do you spend time trying to figure out, like, how did we evolve there from just being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=553.9s	553.9	 mission focused to having to deal with all this other stuff?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=556.1s	556.1	 Yeah, I mean, one theory I have on this is that in Silicon Valley, especially pre
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=559.7s	559.7	 pandemic, we were all it was so competitive to get talent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=563.1s	563.1	 Right. You know, Google and Facebook, they were just kind of one upping each other on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=566.6s	566.6	 like higher and higher salaries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=567.8s	567.8	 And so I know as a CEO of a company that was rising at that time, I felt incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=572.3s	572.3	 scarcity. Like I had people leave to get out who got better offers and it was like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=576.2s	576.2	 real issue. And so I was doing anything I could to retain people and keep them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=580.1s	580.1	 And so if an employee said, hey, I want, you know, another flavor of water in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=584.9s	584.9	 kitchen or whatever, I was like, OK, maybe we should do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=587.2s	587.2	 Right. But I think, you know, during the pandemic, we removed we moved to remote first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=591.2s	591.2	 as a culture, the talent, the talent we could get opened up by 100 X people all over the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=595.9s	595.9	 world who were really hungry and like, frankly, thankful for these jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=599.9s	599.9	 And that actually changed the scarcity mindset a little bit to say, hey, you know, if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=604.3s	604.3	 you don't want to be here, that's fine. We can we have other people we can go recruit and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=607.5s	607.5	 hire in who really are going to value it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=609.5s	609.5	 That's probably just one piece of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=610.9s	610.9	 It's a much more complex issue than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=612.9s	612.9	 I think one other one other thing is that, you know, like Google and Facebook, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=617.5s	617.5	 kind of made this a common trend in the valley where companies would host these open mic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=622.7s	622.7	 Q&A on every Friday or every two weeks or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=625.8s	625.8	 And it was almost like a town hall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=627.1s	627.1	 It felt like a democracy. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=628.9s	628.9	 And in a democracy like the leader, you know, works for the people, they're elected by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=633.1s	633.1	 people. But what got very awkward was that these open mic Q&A's, it became this kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=638.5s	638.5	 of like hostile thing of like, how can we make the person squirm and let's ask them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=642.4s	642.4	 these difficult societal issue questions that aren't actually related to the company and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=645.6s	645.6	 what we're all building? And, you know, I think that was actually a mistake in Silicon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=649.2s	649.2	 Valley. We've since gotten rid of these open mic Q&A's because it really encourages people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=654.3s	654.3	 I'd say we were like 150, 200 people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=657.0s	657.0	 Everyone was on the same page. Everyone was asking good questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=659.5s	659.5	 Once we got to like 500, 700 people, it started to feel like there was a little bit of an us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=663.9s	663.9	 versus them. And then, you know, the questions got very off track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=667.7s	667.7	 And I realized at a certain point, this is not a democracy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=670.9s	670.9	 I want everyone's input. I'm not going to rule like with an iron fist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=673.9s	673.9	 But ultimately, you know, I'm the CEO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=676.1s	676.1	 I need to help guide this company in one direction and force the hard decisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=679.9s	679.9	 Not everyone's going to like them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=681.4s	681.4	 So we're not going to allow people to do grandstanding open mic stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=684.1s	684.1	 There's just a little bit of a risk for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=685.5s	685.5	 You know, 99% of people don't do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=687.3s	687.3	 But if one person does it and it kind of creates this snowball effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=689.8s	689.8	 So we got rid of the open mics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=691.6s	691.6	 People can still submit questions, but nobody else can see them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=695.6s	695.6	 We read them ahead of the Q&A.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=696.9s	696.9	 And if there's a good theme in the questions, we address it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=699.1s	699.1	 But you can't like grandstand with an open mic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=701.2s	701.2	 I saw this site was in Twitter, Nick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=703.8s	703.8	 Maybe you can find it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=704.7s	704.7	 But it was like this general that had commanded all of these different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=707.7s	707.7	 battalions. And he was talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=711.0s	711.0	 What it was like in all the different theaters in which he's operated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=713.9s	713.9	 And he basically said, you know, 80% of the men and women that serve for me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=718.0s	718.0	 were just absolutely incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=720.0s	720.0	 You could always rely on them 100% of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=723.3s	723.3	 They were 100% aligned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=725.6s	725.6	 And then he said there was 15% that was wishy washy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=729.2s	729.2	 And what they were looking for was how you managed and dealt with the 5%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=734.9s	734.9	 And the 5% of folks were always trying to push the boundaries and try to figure out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=739.3s	739.3	 where the escape valve was or where the exception was or, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=743.1s	743.1	 whether they would be grandstanding or whether they try to break a rule.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=747.1s	747.1	 And he said his entire energy was focused on keeping those folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=750.9s	750.9	 extremely focused and on point or out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=754.2s	754.2	 because that was what saw for the 15% because the 80% would be fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=758.4s	758.4	 But if you didn't deal with the five, the 15 would go crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=761.6s	761.6	 And then the 80 would get dejected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=763.3s	763.3	 And it just kind of the whole thing would rot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=765.3s	765.3	 And it was a really interesting reminder that there's these people that come into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=769.1s	769.1	 these companies almost with the desire to see these companies go sideways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=773.3s	773.3	 or just waste their time, which is completely counterintuitive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=776.0s	776.0	 because you think you join for the mission, but they don't all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=780.2s	780.2	 And to be fair, you, I think, told people, listen, you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=784.6s	784.6	 you could, as a group of people off hours, create your own,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=789.1s	789.1	 you know, dinner party and talk about whatever topics you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=792.8s	792.8	 This is just when I'm paying you to come to work for those eight hours,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=796.7s	796.7	 you know, on the company servers, if you're using Slack or whatever,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=799.7s	799.7	 you know, communication platform you're using, let's just stay focused
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=803.2s	803.2	 on getting the work done. So this could be a viable enterprise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=806.9s	806.9	 But you were fine with people if they wanted to self organize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=810.3s	810.3	 and do that on their own time, correct?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=812.3s	812.3	 You weren't saying you can't have political beliefs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=814.4s	814.4	 You can't care, not care about BLM or some right wing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=818.1s	818.1	 That was one of the biggest sort of misnomers or miss
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=823.1s	823.1	 characterization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=824.1s	824.1	 Yeah, exactly. Deliberate mischaracterizations about the policy is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=827.1s	827.1	 it somehow silenced people or prevented them from, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=831.0s	831.0	 taking positions on issues or donating to causes they cared about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=834.4s	834.4	 The policy never said that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=835.3s	835.3	 It just said that while we're in the office together on Coinbase time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=839.1s	839.1	 we're going to engage in Coinbase's mission and avoid fractious debates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=842.7s	842.7	 that divide us. Yeah, that's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=846.1s	846.1	 And there's a time for those debates and just might not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=848.9s	848.9	 I think a lot of this has to do with Slack. I'd be totally honest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=852.6s	852.6	 Yeah. When people are in a Slack room and they're frustrated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=855.8s	855.8	 and people can have valid frustrations, like there are things in the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=858.3s	858.3	 that are horrible. And yeah, you want to talk about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=860.3s	860.3	 And yeah, you build friendships at work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=861.6s	861.6	 It's completely understandable that people would want to blow off steam
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=865.0s	865.0	 and but just people have to look at Slack as not an AOL chat room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=869.3s	869.3	 It's not Reddit. It's not AOL chat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=871.1s	871.1	 Maybe you could talk a little bit about electronic communications.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=873.3s	873.3	 And then I think David has a follow up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=874.4s	874.4	 Yes, I agree with you. Slack, I think, you know, is an amazing tool,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=877.7s	877.7	 but it does start to turn into social media once you get more than,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=881.1s	881.1	 I don't know, 500 people in a room or a thousand people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=884.1s	884.1	 A lot of CEOs I've been talking to, we're all trying to figure this out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=886.8s	886.8	 because we still think Slack is a net positive to productivity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=889.7s	889.7	 but it has a huge negative in terms of both distracting people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=893.3s	893.3	 with lots of things popping up all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=894.9s	894.9	 But also these kind of social media flame wars that did emerge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=898.5s	898.5	 and mob like behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=899.5s	899.5	 So some of the things I mean, we've been trying is, for instance,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=902.3s	902.3	 if we get any kind of a Slack room that has, say, more than 500 or a thousand people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=906.7s	906.7	 we'll often try to limit it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=907.9s	907.9	 So only you know, you can you have to be a VP or level nine and above
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=911.5s	911.5	 can only post in there. And otherwise, it's read only.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=914.7s	914.7	 So we're trying to, you know, Dunbar's number is 150 people, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=917.3s	917.3	 You're trying to think who who can you remember everyone's name
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=919.3s	919.3	 and have some sort of group affinity with them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=921.8s	921.8	 And any too much above Dunbar's number?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=924.0s	924.0	 We try to like cap it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=925.3s	925.3	 So it's it's a read only chat room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=926.9s	926.9	 But I think these tools need to keep evolving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=929.0s	929.0	 And I hope some I know there's a couple of startups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=930.8s	930.8	 You all might have funded some of them that are working on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=933.6s	933.6	 Yeah, there's an actual neat feature you can do in Slack now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=936.4s	936.4	 where like that level nine person can post and everybody else can post in the thread.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=941.2s	941.2	 Like you can reply to the thread, but the opening salvos and thread
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=944.7s	944.7	 have to be started by somebody in that sort of group.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=946.9s	946.9	 So but Slack definitely needs to double down on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=950.0s	950.0	 I also think they put that random room in there and you put the random room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=953.5s	953.5	 It's like basically waving the flag like it's random.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=956.4s	956.4	 Put stuff in there. I think you got to delete that if you're running.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=958.5s	958.5	 I tell all startups, delete the random room
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=960.5s	960.5	 and tell people do not post memes and jokes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=962.8s	962.8	 David, you had a follow up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=963.6s	963.6	 One thing I was going to say is so, Brian, I agree with everything you said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=966.5s	966.5	 The one place maybe where I would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=969.5s	969.5	 nitpick in a way that gives you a little more credit is you found a coin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=972.1s	972.1	 based back in 2012, right? Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=974.7s	974.7	 So if you had created this policy on day one,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=977.9s	977.9	 I don't think you or anybody could have predicted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=980.9s	980.9	 that these issues would arise the way they have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=983.3s	983.3	 I remember 2012 was the year I sold my company to Microsoft.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=986.3s	986.3	 We never had to deal with any of this stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=987.8s	987.8	 And we were using we didn't have Slack back then.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=989.6s	989.6	 We were using Yammer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=990.7s	990.7	 Very open culture. People could communicate on anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=993.0s	993.0	 We never had sort of hyper activist employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=997.9s	997.9	 The word woke didn't even exist yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1000.0s	1000.0	 And it just wasn't an issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1002.7s	1002.7	 So it would have required you, I think, to see ahead so many years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1006.7s	1006.7	 And I think what's happened is over the last several years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1008.9s	1008.9	 there's been this drift towards, you know, employee activism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1013.0s	1013.0	 inside these companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1014.1s	1014.1	 I don't think it's coming from both sides of the political spectrum, to be honest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1017.5s	1017.5	 I think it's coming from the sort of hyper woke employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1020.2s	1020.2	 And they engage in petitions and letter writing campaigns and threats of boycotts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1025.1s	1025.1	 And they sort of Hector and Mao Mao, these CEOs to basically give into them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1030.0s	1030.0	 And we've seen it at Apple the way that the Apple was pressured
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1032.6s	1032.6	 to fire Antonio Garcia Martinez.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1034.7s	1034.7	 And they gave in and now they have a letter writing campaign every month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1037.5s	1037.5	 And you just saw it in Florida.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1039.7s	1039.7	 I think Bob was named Bob Chaypeck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1043.1s	1043.1	 I don't think he's going to survive the year after what just happened at Disney.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1046.7s	1046.7	 And it's because he gave into the employees, took sides against the governor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1051.0s	1051.0	 in Florida and the legislature, and they just ripped away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1054.1s	1054.1	 Disney special privileges in Florida.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1056.5s	1056.5	 You saw it at Netflix, where Ted Sarandos was sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1061.1s	1061.1	 Mao Mao by these employees who want to cancel Dave Chappelle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1064.5s	1064.5	 He ultimately stuck by Chappelle, but only after groveling to these employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1069.3s	1069.3	 And so I think we're seeing these issues did not exist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1071.6s	1071.6	 Even five years ago, I would say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1073.4s	1073.4	 And I think the reason why the Coinbase story is so relevant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1078.2s	1078.2	 to a broader audience and what you did with your policy is so relevant is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1083.1s	1083.1	 I just think every company is going to have to make a decision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1085.5s	1085.5	 sooner or later on where they stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1088.0s	1088.0	 Do you give into these petitions and mobs and boycotts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1091.6s	1091.6	 Do you allow unlimited activism inside the four walls of your company?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1096.6s	1096.6	 Or do you take some sort of more neutral stance where you say, listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1100.3s	1100.3	 we're all going to leave our politics to the door so we can effectively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1103.3s	1103.3	 work together on the company's mission.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1104.9s	1104.9	 I think every company eventually is going to have to either be Coinbase or be Apple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1110.1s	1110.1	 You're going to have to be Coinbase or be Disney.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1112.6s	1112.6	 You're either going to have to give into the mob and suffer the consequences,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1116.4s	1116.4	 or you take the short term pain of doing what Brian did and you basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1121.3s	1121.3	 realign everyone around the mission.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1123.1s	1123.1	 And a year later, you're very happy with where you are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1125.7s	1125.7	 The good thing with Netflix and Disney, though, is that they're going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1128.5s	1128.5	 very clear examples of the business impact of getting distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1134.0s	1134.0	 And I think that, you know, Brian took leadership, but the business impact,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1138.3s	1138.3	 at least from the outside looking in was not really measurable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1141.1s	1141.1	 Obviously he felt that the team felt that whatever they did and that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1143.9s	1143.9	 business is working, but it wasn't done as a public company pre and post.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1148.6s	1148.6	 So the counterfactual is hard to measure in the case of Disney and Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1151.9s	1151.9	 It's really clear to measure, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1153.9s	1153.9	 Meaning in all of this confusion, Netflix has completely botched their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1158.1s	1158.1	 business model in all of this fighting now internally inside of Disney.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1163.0s	1163.0	 Not only are they going to lose essentially a fiefdom inside of Florida,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1166.1s	1166.1	 but it's going to have repercussions with respect to taxes, with respect to debt,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1169.9s	1169.9	 with respect to the quality of the service they can deploy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1172.9s	1172.9	 And that'll eventually flow through the business and that'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1174.9s	1174.9	 be measurable by investors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1176.2s	1176.2	 And I think David, I think probably what I think, which is a slightly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1181.5s	1181.5	 sort of more modified version of what you just said is in the next few
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1184.9s	1184.9	 quarters, I think CEOs will actually be better equipped to numerically point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1190.0s	1190.0	 to why taking Brian's path is the value creating path for shareholders and for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1195.7s	1195.7	 stakeholders and the cost of getting distracted, quote unquote, can be really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1201.3s	1201.3	 expensive if you, if you are a for-profit company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1204.5s	1204.5	 And you also have the option to run your company and say, you know what, we care
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1208.7s	1208.7	 about this issue a whole bunch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1209.9s	1209.9	 We really care about human rights here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1211.6s	1211.6	 We really care about communications and freedom of speech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1215.2s	1215.2	 And I'm going to run Twitter as a freedom of speech company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1218.8s	1218.8	 And everybody has to align behind that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1220.8s	1220.8	 If you believe in censoring, this is not the right company for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1223.7s	1223.7	 If you believe in policing speech or you're uncomfortable with uncomfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1227.9s	1227.9	 speech or speech that makes you feel uncomfortable, you don't have to work at Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1232.2s	1232.2	 So it's not like you have to, you know, do what Brian didn't say, Hey, we're just,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1237.0s	1237.0	 you got to decide on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1237.9s	1237.9	 You got to make a decision and be intentional about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1240.2s	1240.2	 I think it's the higher order bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1241.3s	1241.3	 No, my, I was just going to say, my only point is in the absence of intentionality,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1244.4s	1244.4	 Jason, you'll slip into one realm or the other and not really know what you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1247.6s	1247.6	 trying to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1248.0s	1248.0	 I agree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1249.1s	1249.1	 And my only point is that you'll be able to measure the impact of unintentionally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1253.1s	1253.1	 slipping and sliding around versus picking a course and sticking to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1256.9s	1256.9	 Let me ask you guys a question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1258.2s	1258.2	 If you're an individual and you want to affect social change, where is the forum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1265.1s	1265.1	 in the theater that you think you would go to first, you spend most of your time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1269.3s	1269.3	 at work and maybe you don't have as much free time to go march and protest in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1275.0s	1275.0	 streets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1275.4s	1275.4	 And if you did, no one would pay attention to you there anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1278.1s	1278.1	 So Saks, like I know that you'll probably have a point of view on this, but like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1282.0s	1282.0	 if you're giving a 19 year old who has a strong point of view or a 25 year old
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1286.8s	1286.8	 who has a strong point of view about something that they want to see change in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1290.1s	1290.1	 society, what's the right forum for them to have their protest and to make their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1294.2s	1294.2	 voice heard?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1294.9s	1294.9	 I think that companies are a great change agent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1299.4s	1299.4	 I think we all do being in Silicon Valley, creating startups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1302.1s	1302.1	 We all believe that startups are a great way to change the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1304.1s	1304.1	 Those startups have missions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1305.7s	1305.7	 Brian's company has a mission around crypto and expanding, democratizing access to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1311.2s	1311.2	 the financial system based on crypto.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1312.9s	1312.9	 Elon has a company that is accelerating the world towards sustainable transport and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1320.0s	1320.0	 He wants to make where I quibble a little bit with what Jason said about free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1323.4s	1323.4	 speech. I think Elon wants to make free speech restore its place back in Twitter's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1328.1s	1328.1	 mission. So it's not like a separate thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1330.0s	1330.0	 It's actually like should be very core to what they do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1333.3s	1333.3	 I think that there's a mission driven company out there for any young person who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1338.9s	1338.9	 cares about that issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1341.1s	1341.1	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1341.4s	1341.4	 And if there's not, if there's not a for-profit vehicle, there's a 501.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1344.8s	1344.8	 You can go join a nonprofit company or start one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1348.1s	1348.1	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1348.5s	1348.5	 So that one donate money to a cause.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1350.7s	1350.7	 You have the whole weekend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1351.7s	1351.7	 You got media.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1352.4s	1352.4	 You can write a blog post.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1353.4s	1353.4	 What I don't think would work is when you have people who don't, who aren't really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1357.5s	1357.5	 mission driven, their mission is whatever the current thing is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1360.9s	1360.9	 And so they're just kind of like oscillating from the one, the current, you know, from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1366.5s	1366.5	 one current thing to the next current thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1368.3s	1368.3	 And every three months, there's an issue du jour that that they care about more than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1372.1s	1372.1	 anything else in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1373.2s	1373.2	 Look, there's not going to be a company that can accommodate that sort of fickle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1377.2s	1377.2	 activism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1377.8s	1377.8	 Brian, can I ask you a question?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1379.1s	1379.1	 Are there any systems, decentralized systems that kind of give individuals?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1386.7s	1386.7	 You know, that you've viewed interesting models that give people the ability to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1390.4s	1390.4	 affect social change in a way that kind of historically may have been more of a hill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1395.5s	1395.5	 to climb where people can kind of aggregate resources and aggregate a voice in a way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1399.3s	1399.3	 that can kind of affect outcomes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1401.2s	1401.2	 And do we think that that kind of becomes a mechanism for social change in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1404.6s	1404.6	 future?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1405.2s	1405.2	 You make me think of dows and things like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1407.1s	1407.1	 But I think a lot of that is kind of unproven.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1408.8s	1408.8	 Like, dows are probably good ways to get new kind of governance systems in place for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1413.6s	1413.6	 allocating capital or maybe even managing a city or or a society.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1417.5s	1417.5	 But, you know, I kind of agree with David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1419.5s	1419.5	 I think the best way to affect change right now today is for young people is start a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1423.5s	1423.5	 company or join a company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1425.9s	1425.9	 I think young people are sometimes a little enamored with like becoming an activist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1429.7s	1429.7	 But I think fundamentally that's you're sort of giving up your power by saying, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1433.6s	1433.6	 well, they have the power and I don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1435.1s	1435.1	 And so I'm going to speak truth to power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1437.3s	1437.3	 But I think, you know, there's context for that historically, whether that may have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1440.8s	1440.8	 been more true. But I think today, a lot of people, they have more power than they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1443.7s	1443.7	 realize. And if you go start a company, which by the way, companies are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1446.5s	1446.5	 decentralized, too, you can have lots of little companies all over the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1450.2s	1450.2	 They're not like, you know, monolithic usually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1452.6s	1452.6	 And so if they start a company, they can have a good impact, I think, on the biggest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1456.6s	1456.6	 issues out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1458.4s	1458.4	 And I think over time as well, the way that you have real impact is that you prove
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1462.3s	1462.3	 yourself in the market of ideas to have a high reputation and to be really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1466.8s	1466.8	 reliable. And that is not something that you can just overpower, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1471.7s	1471.7	 because you're 19 or 20 and you're really upset by something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1475.4s	1475.4	 At some point, you're going to have to really invest your time and dedicate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1479.2s	1479.2	 yourself to something that you really, really care about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1481.9s	1481.9	 And then the world tends to move to the good ideas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1485.6s	1485.6	 So I think part of like what we also need to remind folks is that this is a like if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1489.7s	1489.7	 you want to make real sustainable change, it's hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1492.6s	1492.6	 It doesn't matter in which area you pick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1494.9s	1494.9	 It is just really hard. But if it's really worth it, you should give your life to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1498.9s	1498.9	 it. But what I think people push back on is the more superficial forms of just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1504.9s	1504.9	 virtue signaling and saying, yeah, in this moment, I really want to pretend I care
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1509.3s	1509.3	 about something. But when push comes to shove, I'm not really willing to take the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1512.4s	1512.4	 next step. I don't I think that most people find that very unreliable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1515.4s	1515.4	 Yeah, I think a good question to ask for somebody who purports to really care is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1519.4s	1519.4	 like, what do you care about that's not currently in the news? You know, that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1522.7s	1522.7	 not like the hot thing that everyone is basically obsessed with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1527.1s	1527.1	 Well, and then how are you changing it? And what is your plan to change it over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1530.4s	1530.4	 the next decade or two? Like, you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1532.9s	1532.9	 Yeah, because it takes it takes it takes many years to effectively create a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1536.9s	1536.9	 startup, you know, five years, 10 years. And so if your issue de jure is whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1541.5s	1541.5	 is in the news, you're not going to create that kind of change. You know, I do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1544.3s	1544.3	 think there are a lot of similarities between mission driven startups and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1547.7s	1547.7	 political movements. You know, I wrote a blog post called Your Startup is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1550.8s	1550.8	 Movement where I basically say that, you know, good marketing is about evangelism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1555.7s	1555.7	 It is that everything in common with what good political leaders do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1560.3s	1560.3	 Basically, they critique the status quo. They tell you what the world looks like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1564.6s	1564.6	 today, what the problem with that is, and where the world needs to get to what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1569.1s	1569.1	 solution is, and then how they're going to deliver that solution. So you can, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1573.6s	1573.6	 think as the leader of a company, be very mission driven, you can bring about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1578.9s	1578.9	 that change you want to see in the world, you just have to attach a business model
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1581.9s	1581.9	 to it. If you don't have a business model, you're just collecting donations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1584.9s	1584.9	 Let's build on that. Brian, what is the stated mission today of Coinbase?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1589.1s	1589.1	 Yeah, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. And if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1592.8s	1592.8	 for people aren't familiar with that term, economic freedom is kind of an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1595.2s	1595.2	 economics term like GDP, but it looks at the measures of different countries of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1598.7s	1598.7	 the world. And it looks at factors like, are there property rights enforced? How
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1602.8s	1602.8	 stable is the currency? How easy is it to start a business? You know, is there a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1606.5s	1606.5	 corruption and bribery prevalent and things like that? And what's really cool
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1610.1s	1610.1	 about economic freedom is that it basically countries with higher economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1613.1s	1613.1	 freedom, you know, like Singapore and the United States and Ireland, they tend to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1618.5s	1618.5	 correlate with all kinds of things we want in society, not just better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1622.4s	1622.4	 economic growth, but even higher self reported happiness of citizens, better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1626.1s	1626.1	 treatment of the environment, better income for the lowest 10% in society.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1629.9s	1629.9	 Gender equality, all that stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1631.9s	1631.9	 Yeah, gender equality. And then yeah, countries with low economic freedom, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1636.4s	1636.4	 know, Cuba, North Korea, Sudan, these are some of the lowest, they tend to have,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1641.5s	1641.5	 you know, even things we don't want, like higher corruption and higher war, higher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1646.1s	1646.1	 infant mortality. So it's basically when I read the Bitcoin white paper back in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1650.7s	1650.7	 2010, I had this thought eventually that was like, maybe cryptocurrency is this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1655.2s	1655.2	 unique moment in history, this unique technology that allows us to inject
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1658.6s	1658.6	 economic freedom into the countries all over the world, especially now that more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1661.4s	1661.4	 and more people have a smartphone. And we can basically put good financial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1665.0s	1665.0	 infrastructure, good property rights, you know, global trade, a stable currency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1669.3s	1669.3	 into 200 countries all over the world as one small group, relatively small group
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1674.1s	1674.1	 of people. And hopefully it has all these positive downstream impacts. So that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1677.1s	1677.1	 the mission of Coinbase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1678.3s	1678.3	 When you look at the regulatory environment, it has been far from clear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1683.7s	1683.7	 what's allowed here in the United States. In fact, you had a pretty strongly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1689.9s	1689.9	 worded tweet storm back in September of 2021, some really sketchy behavior coming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1696.0s	1696.0	 out of the SEC race recently storytime, maybe you could talk a little bit about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1700.1s	1700.1	 the SEC's approach to cryptocurrency versus securities, XRP comes to mind. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1708.5s	1708.5	 knowing your customer, you've obviously taken a very conservative approach to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1712.1s	1712.1	 what tokens you put on the platform. And then you have competitors who are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1716.4s	1716.4	 offshore who it's kind of YOLO, anything goes. What is the current administration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1722.9s	1722.9	 doing right, wrong, and what needs to happen here in the US to for us to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1727.7s	1727.7	 competitive in crypto, while still protecting citizens from, you know, being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1732.9s	1732.9	 bag holders?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1733.7s	1733.7	 Yeah, it's a big question. So, you know, as a startup, you're always trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1738.3s	1738.3	 thread the needle here, you don't want to wait too long for clarity, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1741.6s	1741.6	 sometimes these things take five, 10 years, and so you'll just never launch a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1745.0s	1745.0	 product. But if you if you're too aggressive, you can blow the place up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1748.5s	1748.5	 And so what we always did in the early days of Coinbase is we said, we want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1752.3s	1752.3	 go do what we think is going to be required in the future, go get licenses,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1756.0s	1756.0	 go do KYC, go do AML, anti money laundering. And so we tried to basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1761.2s	1761.2	 do the right thing, go and talk to these regulators practically. Now, the US has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1765.1s	1765.1	 actually been pretty forward thinking on this, I'd say every year, we get more and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1768.5s	1768.5	 more clarity. So Coinbase is now a very regulated financial service business, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1772.6s	1772.6	 know, I can go through the whole list, we have a license from the CFTC, a federal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1776.3s	1776.3	 regulator, we acquired some brokerage or licenses, which the SEC regulates, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1780.3s	1780.3	 have money transmission licenses, we're a bit licensed in New York, etc. going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1783.7s	1783.7	 that's just in the United States. So we're in many, many countries around the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1786.8s	1786.8	 world. So how do we get more clarity? Well, one thing I'll just say is it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1791.1s	1791.1	 actually better for there to be lack of clarity than to be clarity that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1795.2s	1795.2	 punitive or bad. So it's good that there's a little bit of lack of clarity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1799.8s	1799.8	 as long as it's not curtailing the industry, but would be even better is to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1803.0s	1803.0	 have clarity that does provide that right balance of good consumer protection, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1807.8s	1807.8	 know, make sure that there's a fair level playing field for all the players. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1812.4s	1812.4	 then it allows innovation to flourish. And so what's good now is that in the US,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1817.2s	1817.2	 you know, the Biden administration put out an executive order recently kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1819.9s	1819.9	 asking all the different agencies and departments to come back with a clear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1823.1s	1823.1	 plan. And they did recognize the potential innovation in crypto in that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1827.0s	1827.0	 executive order, which I was really pleasantly surprised to see. So what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1831.6s	1831.6	 happening now is that there was a little bit of jockeying, I think, there where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1834.8s	1834.8	 the SEC said, hey, these all look like securities to us. And I don't think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1837.6s	1837.6	 that's quite true. You know, the CFTC is regulates commodities while some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1841.3s	1841.3	 cryptos are going to be commodities. I think here's here's what I'm realizing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1845.1s	1845.1	 is that crypto is going to be many different things. It's not just going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1848.3s	1848.3	 be one regulator doing it. So, you know, think about cryptocurrencies like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1852.4s	1852.4	 Bitcoin, that's pretty clearly a commodity or Ethereum, right? Like, many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1855.9s	1855.9	 of these are commodities that probably should be regulated by the commodities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1858.9s	1858.9	 regulator, the CFTC. Now, if people want to raise money for their company, a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1862.9s	1862.9	 security token, that should be regulated as a security by the SEC. That'd be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1866.4s	1866.4	 great to have more clarity on that. Let's have, we would love to keep working
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1870.1s	1870.1	 with the SEC to make that a well trodden path that any company can go raise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1873.9s	1873.9	 money. And that's how it would get listed on an exchange like ours. And we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1876.5s	1876.5	 could register as a broker dealer or whatever license is needed. Separately,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1881.7s	1881.7	 there's also some cryptocurrencies that are going to be currencies like stable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1884.9s	1884.9	 coins. And, you know, maybe the Treasury should regulate those. And finally,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1888.6s	1888.6	 there's going to be cryptocurrencies that are none of the above, they're artwork
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1892.3s	1892.3	 or something that's probably shouldn't even be regulated. And so the US with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1896.9s	1896.9	 various financial, you know, international bodies like G20 and FATF
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1901.3s	1901.3	 and all these IMF are probably going to put some policy papers together, we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1905.4s	1905.4	 going to eventually end up with some kind of a test that says, is this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1908.6s	1908.6	 cryptocurrency a commodity, a security, a currency or something else like artwork?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1913.3s	1913.3	 And then maybe maybe five more things we haven't even thought of that will end up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1916.5s	1916.5	 being in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1917.2s	1917.2	 What would you make the test for this is a utility token versus speculative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1924.9s	1924.9	 security, because that seems to be the one that's really hard for people to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1928.7s	1928.7	 figure out if 99% of people are buying a token on Coinbase, because they want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1934.7s	1934.7	 see it appreciate and they want to see it gain value, and only 1% are using it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1939.3s	1939.3	 for the actual utility of it. Is it then a security? Is it by the percentage of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1943.7s	1943.7	 people who use it? How how would you as the the you know, the leader in this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1949.1s	1949.1	 industry, you know, actually define it? What's your definition?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1953.8s	1953.8	 Yeah, so I think, look, I don't want to be presumptuous here. I think that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1957.5s	1957.5	 can we can put some policy papers together, but I don't want to be, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1960.9s	1960.9	 know, it's the policymakers job to come up with the policy. So I don't want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1964.1s	1964.1	 step on anyone anyone's toes. But that being said, I think there's some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1966.8s	1966.8	 existing case law out there, like, you know, the Howie test is something from a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1970.0s	1970.0	 long time ago, we could probably build upon that. So the Howie test kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1973.4s	1973.4	 says, you know, is this an investment in a common enterprise with an expectation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1977.8s	1977.8	 of profit? And that would make it that would make it a security. So there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1980.3s	1980.3	 lot of pieces to that, you know, is it an investment? Well, if you're just giving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1983.5s	1983.5	 the tokens away, I guess people aren't investing, right? Is it a common
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1986.6s	1986.6	 enterprise? Well, maybe if it's decentralized, and you don't actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1989.5s	1989.5	 control this entity, like you own, you know, less than a majority share or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1993.2s	1993.2	 something, maybe then that's not a security, right? Or if there's not an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1995.8s	1995.8	 expectation of profit, people are using it for something. So every startup right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=1999.4s	1999.4	 now in the space has basically had to hire a bunch of expensive lawyers to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2002.4s	2002.4	 tease apart these old old rules that some of them were created in like the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2005.7s	2005.7	 1930s, you know, before the internet and everything, and try to understand where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2011.1s	2011.1	 they're falling. And so I think building upon that Howie test, but it could be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2014.9s	2014.9	 something that includes a commodities definition, something or currency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2017.9s	2017.9	 definition. You know, I think we should basically it's on us and the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2022.1s	2022.1	 crypto companies out there to go hire a really smart lawyer who has drafted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2026.5s	2026.5	 legislation before and a bill and actually get a draft of it out there and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2030.1s	2030.1	 then we can start to circulate it with various policymakers and get their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2032.9s	2032.9	 feedback and maybe they take it and run with it. Maybe they say thanks, we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2035.5s	2035.5	 it, we've got it from here. But that's our next step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2038.0s	2038.0	 Friedberg, Sachs, Jamath, would you go with the Howie test? Or do you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2043.1s	2043.1	 thoughts on how to how the government here in the US should say this is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2046.7s	2046.7	 security, this is a utility token?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2049.8s	2049.8	 I think what the EO did was basically kind of give people enough regulatory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2058.8s	2058.8	 safety in the sense that something reasonable will probably happen in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2062.7s	2062.7	 reasonable future so that people could keep building and iterating. My big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2066.2s	2066.2	 takeaway in the last sort of like nine months is that this thing is now too big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2070.3s	2070.3	 to fail. And the government basically has to just find a reasonable framework to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2074.2s	2074.2	 enable something because the the real big issue Jason would be if they did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2078.2s	2078.2	 something crazy, and now, you know, retail would just get completely smoked,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2082.0s	2082.0	 because I think they are the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2083.3s	2083.3	 what do you think is reasonable?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2084.5s	2084.5	 I think Congress has to basically pass a sensible set of legislations that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2087.9s	2087.9	 clearly demarcate exactly what Brian said, this realm of stuff goes to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2091.5s	2091.5	 CFTC, this realm of stuff goes to the SEC. Now you guys go and implement. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2096.7s	2096.7	 if left to their own devices, those two will use these arcane laws and try to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2099.9s	2099.9	 negotiate amongst each other, who should be covering what but they can't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2102.9s	2102.9	 arbitrate that decision. And so as a result, nothing will nothing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2105.7s	2105.7	 reasonable will happen. So I think that's what has to happen. Congress has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2109.4s	2109.4	 to get together and write something reasonable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2110.8s	2110.8	 Free bird you are building companies at the production board every year you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2114.7s	2114.7	 build a couple of companies, you have to go through securities law, you have to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2118.6s	2118.6	 you know, raise money from accredited investors, you do it in the traditional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2122.7s	2122.7	 way. But you must be looking at crypto saying, well, I could launch Kana,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2127.1s	2127.1	 unique, whatever project and have a token associated with it and raise money and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2130.9s	2130.9	 raise it globally or started down. What do you think is a reasonable way for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2136.3s	2136.3	 people like yourself who are playing by the existing rules to be able to embrace
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2142.4s	2142.4	 this new technology and these new platforms and paradigms? I think a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2146.3s	2146.3	 bit government handle it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2147.5s	2147.5	 Well, some perspectives important, which is, you know, go back to kind of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2152.1s	2152.1	 1920s in the United States, and there were pre 1920s, folks would go around and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2158.7s	2158.7	 tell tall tales about interesting business ideas or business concepts or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2163.4s	2163.4	 things that they were going to do with if they got a bunch of money from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2165.9s	2165.9	 investors and investors gave them money. And they didn't actually deliver on what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2169.5s	2169.5	 they said they were going to do. And they got swindled. And there was swindle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2172.7s	2172.7	 story after swindle story that you can read about. And we saw this even with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2176.7s	2176.7	 ICO craze of a few years ago, right, where people tell a tall tale, you expect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2180.9s	2180.9	 some value or some asset that you're kind of putting capital into that will pay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2185.2s	2185.2	 off over time. And there's a swindle behind it. And that's really the origin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2189.7s	2189.7	 of securities laws, in large part is to protect the individual from being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2194.3s	2194.3	 swindled to protect the storyteller that can take money away from people and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2198.3s	2198.3	 figure out how to kind of rip them off and create a set of laws that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2203.1s	2203.1	 government can then enforce through the risk of imprisonment against doing those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2207.4s	2207.4	 things. The challenge becomes when there's this more thoughtful way of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2212.5s	2212.5	 running capital markets on the other side, and how do we actually resolve to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2216.3s	2216.3	 some medium ground here? I'm not sure that you're going to have as quick of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2220.4s	2220.4	 resolution to say, well, let's go back to the old way where anyone can say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2223.5s	2223.5	 anything to anyone they want. And anyone can put money into any project that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2227.3s	2227.3	 want. Because the role of the arbiter is to protect those from being taken
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2231.7s	2231.7	 advantage of if 85% of those projects are great. And 85% of the investors are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2236.3s	2236.3	 intelligent and know what they're doing. It's the 15 it doesn't matter. It's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2239.7s	2239.7	 15% that the government is here to protect. And that's the reason we have an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2245.0s	2245.0	 institution called the government is to create systems of protection for those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2249.5s	2249.5	 who are otherwise unable to protect themselves. Now a free market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2253.0s	2253.0	 libertarian might say, we should have at it. But the problem is we all have we all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2258.1s	2258.1	 feel as a group, at some point, a moral obligation to protect those who are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2263.4s	2263.4	 unprotected. And that's why these systems emerge over time. And that's why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2266.9s	2266.9	 these institutions exist. That's why the government exists. And it's why these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2270.0s	2270.0	 securities laws exist. And so it's difficult to assume that we can just go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2273.8s	2273.8	 back to the kind of, you know, prototypical days of, you know, let me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2280.0s	2280.0	 raise money for anything with any story without any regulation, and assume that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2283.6s	2283.6	 it's going to work out well, because all it's going to take is a few of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2286.6s	2286.6	 stories before you have folks standing up in Congress saying, this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2290.3s	2290.3	 unbelievable, we can't let this happen anymore. Let's go shut down the miners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2293.7s	2293.7	 Let's go shut down the data centers. Let's go after every asset we can. And by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2297.0s	2297.0	 the way, they will because look at what just happened with Russia, the way that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2300.5s	2300.5	 governments can kind of coalesce around digital systems now, and make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2304.1s	2304.1	 significant change and block things from happening. I don't know if there is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2308.0s	2308.0	 world where we can assume that even with a free and open internet, that these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2312.0s	2312.0	 systems can truly be decentralized, given the reach that governments have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2316.0s	2316.0	 And it is going to be in my mind, I've said this in the past, kind of the great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2319.3s	2319.3	 tension of the 21st century socially, is the decentralized systems that really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2323.8s	2323.8	 want to challenge what we believe to be a lot of overreach that's happening by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2327.5s	2327.5	 governments against the government's believed role to be protecting those who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2331.5s	2331.5	 are who need the protection. And so I don't know, that's a very long winded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2335.0s	2335.0	 moral statement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2336.1s	2336.1	 Well, I mean, I think it's a very interesting one. Brian, what do you what do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2339.0s	2339.0	 you think of this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2339.6s	2339.6	 I get it. These are complicated issues, right? We want to balance protecting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2342.9s	2342.9	 people, but we also want to not have the government be in a position where it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2346.5s	2346.5	 picking winners and losers. And so, you know, just because something is legal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2352.2s	2352.2	 doesn't make it make it a good investment. I guess, you know, you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2354.9s	2354.9	 have you could have owned Netflix last week or something like that. You guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2358.9s	2358.9	 might talk about that in a minute. But look, I think we all want to get rid of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2362.5s	2362.5	 fraud, right? So if you commit fraud, meaning you lied to investors, then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2368.8s	2368.8	 that's going to be a crime, right? Like we I want to I want to work with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2371.7s	2371.7	 anybody in government to go put that make that stuff not happen. The danger is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2375.4s	2375.4	 if we ever get into a place where we say, well, only wealthy people can now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2378.5s	2378.5	 invest, because somehow there's an accredited investor test, that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2381.7s	2381.7	 inherently exclusionary. I don't I don't like the accredited investor laws. If
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2385.3s	2385.3	 we ever get into a place where the government is saying, you know, well, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2387.5s	2387.5	 have to, you have to have x, y, z criteria and a person with this many years of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2391.3s	2391.3	 experience on their resume. And then now we get into like the government sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2394.8s	2394.8	 designed by committee to pick winners and losers. And that's that's inherently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2398.1s	2398.1	 flawed. Because, you know, a lot of true breakthrough innovation, they look like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2402.5s	2402.5	 bad ideas at the beginning, they're the kind of things that a government body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2405.9s	2405.9	 would never invest in or put money into, right? So that's the inherent tension we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2410.1s	2410.1	 have to worry about protecting people, but not putting the government in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2413.1s	2413.1	 role of picking winners and losers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2414.3s	2414.3	 Sacks, you have any input on this sort of framework, you are investing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2419.1s	2419.1	 traditionally in stocks, but you have also allocated some money to multi coin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2423.8s	2423.8	 capital and other folks who are buying tokens, and then you have to distribute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2427.5s	2427.5	 them and you have to deal with these downstream legal issues, how are you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2429.9s	2429.9	 dealing with them? And then what do you think is a is a proper framework here in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2433.8s	2433.8	 the US for protecting consumers while allowing innovation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2436.9s	2436.9	 I think the big picture framework that we have is correct, which is you kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2440.0s	2440.0	 have this dichotomy between security tokens and utility tokens. So security
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2444.9s	2444.9	 tokens, basically, it's a token that's issued, that it's basically like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2449.6s	2449.6	 share of stock or a fractional ownership in some business doesn't really have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2455.0s	2455.0	 lot of functionality associated with it. That's kind of an end run around the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2458.7s	2458.7	 securities laws, they should be treated like securities. On the other hand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2461.9s	2461.9	 though, there are a lot of tokens that are issued as part of creating a new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2467.6s	2467.6	 kind of technology network. And those tokens have real functionality. And if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2472.1s	2472.1	 you were to subject them to securities laws, and impose KYC and accreditation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2476.2s	2476.2	 you have to go through all these oops, just to add one to your wallet, it would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2479.1s	2479.1	 destroy the potential functionality created by these systems. So where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2483.3s	2483.3	 there's real utility like that, I think the government should foster innovation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2487.7s	2487.7	 by having a lighter hand, don't subject them to securities laws. And really what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2492.3s	2492.3	 entrepreneurs need in the space are some safe harbors, really clear lines around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2497.8s	2497.8	 what would trip them up and have them cross over from utility token and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2503.1s	2503.1	 security token, so they know to avoid those things, so they can continue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2506.6s	2506.6	 innovating on their core project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2508.8s	2508.8	 I think that's well said. I have three ideas, Brian, I want to run by number
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2512.9s	2512.9	 one, a sophisticated test for investors in crypto and in startups. So just like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2517.7s	2517.7	 you get a gun test or, you know, a test or a driver's license, we come up with a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2522.3s	2522.3	 way for people to become sophisticated, they take a simple test, maybe it's a, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2526.3s	2526.3	 know, whatever number of questions. And then second, maybe some safe harbors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2530.7s	2530.7	 around the scale of a project. So any crypto project under 10 million can be an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2535.3s	2535.3	 experiment. And, you know, it's kind of like, no need to have rules, people just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2539.9s	2539.9	 have to sign a disclaimer or a waiver, this is an experiment, then things may be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2543.1s	2543.1	 between 10 and 100 million, you implement KYC and maybe throttle the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2547.5s	2547.5	 number of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2548.2s	2548.2	 those are some good ideas for when you're talking about the bucket of security
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2551.5s	2551.5	 tokens, if you want to start imposing those kinds of rules on utility tokens,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2556.3s	2556.3	 you can't have a functioning network with like all these sort of friction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2560.9s	2560.9	 Well, hold on. But if then if the project gets scale, then you just have to file a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2565.7s	2565.7	 little more have a little more KYC. And then finally, the founders of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2569.3s	2569.3	 projects, they can just launch them and disappear. They have no director like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2575.0s	2575.0	 duty to the project. Do you think there needs to be something similar to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2579.7s	2579.7	 directors in corporation? So just three ideas there that I've heard other people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2584.9s	2584.9	 talk about, or I've been thinking about, Brian,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2587.1s	2587.1	 those are pretty good. I like those, actually. I mean, the nice thing about a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2590.2s	2590.2	 driver's license test for financial literacy is that it doesn't measure how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2594.1s	2594.1	 much money you have. So it would allow smart, you know, aspiring people who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2598.8s	2598.8	 didn't start with a lot of money, like a lot of us to also be able to participate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2603.0s	2603.0	 early on in these, which would be really great. Yeah, I think it's, you know, some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2607.1s	2607.1	 kind of a safe harbor or sandbox provision, I think is a really great idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2610.5s	2610.5	 as well. And lastly, yeah, I mean, if you were able to, I'm basically I think your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2615.0s	2615.0	 three ideas are great. So those are good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2617.4s	2617.4	 I think they're good for securities. But I mean, if you just want to buy gas on a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2621.9s	2621.9	 blockchain to run your program, where you're a user of a application that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2627.1s	2627.1	 being run on a blockchain, you just want to buy a token for gas, do you really have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2631.1s	2631.1	 to go through all these like KYC type hoops?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2633.0s	2633.0	 Hopefully not, especially if it's if it's a utility. I mean, self custodial wallets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2636.3s	2636.3	 and dApps or decentralized apps are this huge area of innovation that, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2640.2s	2640.2	 you wouldn't want to like, imagine if the US government had said you need to come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2643.1s	2643.1	 in and register to make a website or something like that, that would have been a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2646.1s	2646.1	 terrible thing for innovation globally. So you have to remember, too, that a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2650.9s	2650.9	 of this is going to flow to the country with the most permissive laws. So a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2654.9s	2654.9	 governments around the world, not the most permissive, but the most well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2658.2s	2658.2	 structured that balances all the all the pros and cons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2660.2s	2660.2	 Maybe clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2661.7s	2661.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2662.5s	2662.5	 The thing that I would just add to this, though, is that there's a lot more than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2665.5s	2665.5	 just AML and KYC guys that has to happen for this to be a functioning ecosystem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2671.1s	2671.1	 We average, I think, one hack a week in the crypto ecosystem, right? This bean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2676.0s	2676.0	 stock happened, what, just a few days ago, that was almost $200 million. Last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2681.3s	2681.3	 month, Axie Infinity, what was that almost $600 million? So there's a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2685.3s	2685.3	 stuff where in the in the normal securities world, like if you're a director
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2691.3s	2691.3	 of a company, and you don't have these adequate procedures, and Brian, you live
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2695.1s	2695.1	 this every day where there's like an audit committee, and there's somebody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2697.4s	2697.4	 that chairs audit that has to go and think about information security and blah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2701.5s	2701.5	 blah, blah, and all these disclosures have to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2704.1s	2704.1	 Insurance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2705.1s	2705.1	 But all these disclosures are really about actual work being done. If you don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2708.9s	2708.9	 do that work, and then you get hacked, you're actually liable, right? There's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2712.5s	2712.5	 no version of this in a world where it is a little bit of the Wild West. So that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2715.8s	2715.8	 stuff also has to exist. This is what I what I mean by I actually think Congress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2719.9s	2719.9	 just needs to kind of like update the set of laws that actually allow the CFTC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2724.7s	2724.7	 and the SEC to do their job to include this and say now go and incrementally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2728.1s	2728.1	 figure this out. Because even if you get the AML and KYC stuff, right, then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2732.8s	2732.8	 there's all this other stuff where, you know, these folks that had their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2735.7s	2735.7	 basically, you know, all this all this value deprived, who do they go to try to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2740.3s	2740.3	 get the money back? You know, in the case of AXE, I mean, this is it's an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2745.1s	2745.1	 incredible thing. But like, you know, they went to Andreessen, and they raised a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2747.7s	2747.7	 new round, they're like, we're just going to make everybody whole. But that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2750.3s	2750.3	 insane. Right? That's like not you can't expect that to happen with every single
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2754.3s	2754.3	 project, every single company, it's not going to be possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2757.2s	2757.2	 Yeah. Well, I think a couple things will happen. I mean, in the in the custodial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2761.0s	2761.0	 world of crypto, there'll be more regulation there already is right, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2764.0s	2764.0	 we have a New York Trust company that we get audited for various control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2768.4s	2768.4	 environments and safety and things like that. But in the self custodial world,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2771.9s	2771.9	 everyone is going to start to be in control of their own assets. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2775.8s	2775.8	 that, you know, the tools are getting better and better for that, like, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2778.8s	2778.8	 know, social recovery of keys, if you if you forget your password, and these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2782.9s	2782.9	 kind of smart contract wallets. And so, you know, both are growing. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2787.8s	2787.8	 in the future, people may actually start to take more responsibilities for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2790.5s	2790.5	 storing their own wealth, if they want to choose to do that. And that'll allow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2793.9s	2793.9	 them to kind of access a broader ecosystem of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2797.5s	2797.5	 Let me ask you a question, Brian. Everybody seems to be very concerned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2801.4s	2801.4	 about tether. You I don't believe participate in the tether ecosystem at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2806.4s	2806.4	 Coinbase. Is that correct?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2808.7s	2808.7	 Well, we're not participating directly, but we support as many assets as people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2812.5s	2812.5	 want to use. And that is one of the ones that we've supported people to deposit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2816.1s	2816.1	 and withdraw in Coinbase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2817.5s	2817.5	 They've been banned in New York, they've had regulatory action in Canada, people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2825.3s	2825.3	 are concerned about their attestations or lack of clarity on their commercial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2830.0s	2830.0	 paper. What do you think of the stable coins getting very big? And maybe USDC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2837.3s	2837.3	 seems to have it pretty tightly covered. But there's all these concerns and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2841.2s	2841.2	 regulatory actions against tether. Is that a big nothing burger? Or does it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2845.6s	2845.6	 concern you that there's a lack of transparency into their holdings?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2851.0s	2851.0	 Yeah, so I would say, you know, some of the early stable coin efforts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2854.6s	2854.6	 definitely didn't have all their ducks in a row from a reputational point of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2858.4s	2858.4	 view. You know, I'm not an I'm not an expert on tether. My understanding is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2862.2s	2862.2	 that there have been some investigations and enforcement actions, which have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2865.6s	2865.6	 required them to go in there and clean up some things. And, you know, our, our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2870.3s	2870.3	 digital asset listing group kind of looked at a lot of this in depth and made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2873.0s	2873.0	 that judgment called that where they where they were and where they are now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2877.3s	2877.3	 But yeah, I do think that we're seeing the emergence of new groups like, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2881.2s	2881.2	 know, USD coin is one of those that I think has some better controls around it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2885.3s	2885.3	 And there's actually a bunch of stable coins now that are decentralized. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2890.5s	2890.5	 know, die and fracks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2892.1s	2892.1	 explain what that is, and why it's important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2895.2s	2895.2	 Well, so okay, so it really comes down to trust. I mean, you know, you can trust,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2900.6s	2900.6	 you can decide to trust something like USDC that has kind of audit requirements
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2904.4s	2904.4	 and you know, a big four accounting firm come in and look at it and things like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2907.3s	2907.3	 that. Or you can look at smart contract code and you know, thousands of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2912.5s	2912.5	 around the world can look at that and there's an inherent bug bounty if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2914.8s	2914.8	 find an issue there. And if it hasn't been found, then you can start to think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2917.6s	2917.6	 about trusting that. Now, I think stable coins like like die and others, they've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2923.4s	2923.4	 been able to create these relatively complex systems that have sort of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2927.7s	2927.7	 one asset which is intended to be stable, but another one which is sort of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2931.1s	2931.1	 collateral. And you could imagine various black swan events where you know, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2934.9s	2934.9	 peg would get broken and things like that. But it really hasn't happened yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2937.7s	2937.7	 in die. And it's shown a lot of resiliency, which I've been very impressed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2941.5s	2941.5	 by. There's one actually one other type of coin, which I think is even maybe more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2946.2s	2946.2	 interesting than just wrapping a fiat like a dollar or a rupee or something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2951.3s	2951.3	 like that. Because frankly, you know, the dollar is seeing a lot of inflation, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2954.3s	2954.3	 guys have talked about it many times on this show. So do you really want to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2957.5s	2957.5	 a stable stable coin that is inflating 8% a year? Exactly. There's there's some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2962.7s	2962.7	 new coins coming out, which I've been really excited to see, which are, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2966.1s	2966.1	 think, you know, biology calls them flat coins, but they're basically looking at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2969.1s	2969.1	 the consumer price index. And they're trying to basically have flat purchasing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2974.6s	2974.6	 power and assume that the dollar and various fiat currencies around the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2978.3s	2978.3	 actually going to go through more inflation. That's a pretty cool idea. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2981.3s	2981.3	 you can do that in a creative way on a blockchain by having various oracles,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2984.8s	2984.8	 which are these sources of truth. And if enough of them, you know, 51% of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2988.1s	2988.1	 tell you the CPI we think is this this year, it can kind of keep keep pace with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2992.4s	2992.4	 CPI, which is a really cool innovation, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2994.7s	2994.7	 Thank you so much for Brian Armstrong for joining us for the first hour. And now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=2997.6s	2997.6	 we'll continue on with our Netflix discussion. Brian's fantastic. He was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3001.2s	3001.2	 very honest, he answered a lot of questions very honestly, and he's a super
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3004.4s	3004.4	 fan of the show. That business is a great business. That business will be a great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3008.3s	3008.3	 business. We like somebody who's thoughtful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3010.6s	3010.6	 I really think that the challenge that Brian faced a year and a half ago and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3013.4s	3013.4	 the policy decision he faced is now being faced by every CEO across America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3018.0s	3018.0	 And that's the broad relevance is, you know, what are they going to do? Do you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3021.7s	3021.7	 see this this quote by the McDonald's CEO, the former McDonald's CEO Ed Renzi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3026.0s	3026.0	 on Wednesday said companies have no business being in politics, and has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3030.1s	3030.1	 launched a new advocacy coalition to fight woke corporate politics. He said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3035.8s	3035.8	 corporations have no business being on the right or the left, because they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3039.5s	3039.5	 represent everybody there and their sole job is to build equity for their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3043.2s	3043.2	 investors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3043.9s	3043.9	 Wait, the people who make filet of fish are not going to chime in on Ukraine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3047.7s	3047.7	 anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3048.8s	3048.8	 Yeah, but but think about that, because that actually is a pretty radical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3053.3s	3053.3	 It is a line in the sand. Yeah, he's standing on Brian shoulders. Let's be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3056.4s	3056.4	 honest. I think you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3058.1s	3058.1	 the CEO McDonald's I mean, that's like a big, you know, traditional fortune
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3061.9s	3061.9	 500 type corporation. And they're saying like, we're not doing this anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3065.7s	3065.7	 Well, you know what, they were more than willing to do it if it scored them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3068.1s	3068.1	 points. What they realized was it's going to be a never once you engage that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3072.3s	3072.3	 you're never going to be able to disengage from it. All right, let's pivot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3075.3s	3075.3	 over to Netflix, they reported a drop in net subscribers for the first time in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3079.0s	3079.0	 10 years, and the stock dropped 35% market cap from 155 billion to about 98
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3087.3s	3087.3	 billion. According to Bloomberg, as of Wednesday, Netflix was the worst
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3090.9s	3090.9	 performing S&P 500 so far in 2022 stock down 63% year to date, Ackman dumped his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3100.0s	3100.0	 entire stake and booked a $430 million loss. And a large part of this was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3107.1s	3107.1	 because they didn't hit their 2.5 million or so target increase in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3112.3s	3112.3	 subscribers. And they in fact, lost all 700,000 Russian subscribers as part of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3119.3s	3119.3	 boycotting Russia because of the Ukraine war. What do we think is happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3127.8s	3127.8	 here? Is this a bellwether Chamath for something more important going on? Or is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3134.1s	3134.1	 this just Netflix not executing well?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3137.9s	3137.9	 I think there are there's a macro thing. And then there's a Netflix specific
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3142.5s	3142.5	 thing. The macro thing is that we are learning the broad sweeping impact of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3148.2s	3148.2	 Apple's privacy changes. In my opinion, you first saw it flow through into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3153.3s	3153.3	 Facebook's earnings, and basically them saying this is going to be really tough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3157.3s	3157.3	 And you had Netflix, even if you add back the Russian subscribers basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3161.1s	3161.1	 spend almost $600 million in the quarter on customer acquisition, to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3165.2s	3165.2	 effectively they would have generated 500,000 subscribers net of churn, right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3169.3s	3169.3	 which was still about a million and a half under where they needed to be. So the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3172.8s	3172.8	 point is that I think Netflix in some ways was a little bit of a canary in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3176.8s	3176.8	 coal mine for the the shrinking effectiveness of online advertising. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3185.2s	3185.2	 I think that's why you then saw two days later, Facebook got taken to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3189.9s	3189.9	 woodshed in two days was down, you know, now it's down, I don't know, 1520%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3193.9s	3193.9	 Google, I think has been down a lot today, it's just getting absolutely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3198.0s	3198.0	 smoked relative to the market. So that's the macro issue, which is I think, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3203.6s	3203.6	 really hard for these ads to be as effective as they used to be. And it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3207.3s	3207.3	 only going to get worse because Google has also said that they're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3209.7s	3209.7	 implement a lot of the same versions of what Apple did inside of Android. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3213.3s	3213.3	 customer acquisition is going up. So if you look at then all the companies that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3216.2s	3216.2	 have to live and die on CAC, it's going to be an expensive road. That's the macro
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3223.6s	3223.6	 thing, I think that not enough people are talking about. I think the micro thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3227.0s	3227.0	 inside of Netflix is that, you know, people churn out of a service when there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3233.1s	3233.1	 isn't enough value. And I think that's the most basic explanation of why so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3238.8s	3238.8	 many people are leaving Netflix is that it's not that valuable. So when you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3242.3s	3242.3	 spending $20 billion a year on content, but people more than ever are leaving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3247.6s	3247.6	 the service, you have to inspect how much are you really spending in these areas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3251.4s	3251.4	 and what is it actually creating in terms of like library value, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3255.2s	3255.2	 Disney Plus, I think has gotten has done an incredible job in a much shorter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3260.8s	3260.8	 period of time. Apple, after only a few years wins the first Oscar of any of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3266.2s	3266.2	 streamers, right beating Netflix, even though they've been in there and spent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3270.1s	3270.1	 a hundred for best picture, but I'm saying, so when you put all these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3273.5s	3273.5	 together, I think Netflix probably has lost a little bit of the script, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3277.4s	3277.4	 they're also suffering from a really macro headwind, which is the advertising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3280.2s	3280.2	 business is broken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3282.1s	3282.1	 I would imagine that like total subscribers to streaming services, and if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3286.8s	3286.8	 you were to add up total subscription service dollars, it's probably growing a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3290.4s	3290.4	 lot. Netflix's relative share is going down because the quality of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3296.0s	3296.0	 competitors is improving so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3298.2s	3298.2	 Even companies that are not able to deliver like CNN, shut down CNN plus this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3302.4s	3302.4	 week after investing $300 million in trying to build out the service.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3306.8s	3306.8	 I mean, folks are putting serious dollars behind these projects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3310.6s	3310.6	 And so the competition is fierce and they've got deep content libraries behind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3314.2s	3314.2	 them. I personally think HBO Max is the best streaming service now, followed by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3319.1s	3319.1	 Disney Plus, followed by maybe a mix of Amazon, Netflix and, you know, Prime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3327.2s	3327.2	 And so like Netflix's relative value is going down because there's so much other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3332.0s	3332.0	 content when I'm kind of thinking about what to watch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3334.4s	3334.4	 I'm looking at Disney Plus, I'm looking at HBO Max and I'm like, Hey, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3338.2s	3338.2	 what should I watch tonight?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3339.6s	3339.6	 And then I look at Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3340.7s	3340.7	 Netflix doesn't have a monopoly in content anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3344.1s	3344.1	 And so when I've got limited dollars, I personally, I looked at this after we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3347.7s	3347.7	 were texting about it. I subscribe to seven streaming services right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3352.2s	3352.2	 And if I didn't care as much about how much I was spending per month, I would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3355.2s	3355.2	 probably cut three of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3356.4s	3356.4	 And Netflix would probably...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3356.9s	3356.9	 Under a hundred.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3358.3s	3358.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3358.6s	3358.6	 You're also then highlighting the second, I think, macro thing that is actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3363.6s	3363.6	 equally important, maybe even more important, which is, you know, the first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3367.2s	3367.2	 rule of capitalism says that excess returns will always get competed away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3371.8s	3371.8	 So, you know, Netflix had the run of the place where they were an effective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3375.3s	3375.3	 monopoly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3376.1s	3376.1	 Totally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3376.4s	3376.4	 And now when everybody else woke up and got religion, they decided to invest and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3380.4s	3380.4	 they've created some really compelling content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3382.7s	3382.7	 And so all of those returns will now get spread across seven or eight or nine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3387.3s	3387.3	 competitors, which means that just by definition, mathematically, Netflix can't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3390.8s	3390.8	 win the way that they used to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3392.5s	3392.5	 And the network advantage in the streaming model is content and consumers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3396.5s	3396.5	 So you have better content, you get more consumers, you get more money from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3399.9s	3399.9	 consumers, you spend more on content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3401.8s	3401.8	 At some point you get diminishing returns in that network model.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3405.0s	3405.0	 And now we're seeing those diminishing returns hit Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3407.8s	3407.8	 They haven't built advantages in search and discovery or in other social sharing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3412.6s	3412.6	 or other features into the app or into the service that will give them more of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3416.0s	3416.0	 lock-in value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3417.0s	3417.0	 Because all I'm doing is buying content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3418.6s	3418.6	 There are also three times the price of Disney Plus and other services.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3424.0s	3424.0	 So in the competition space, people are starting to look at and go, is this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3428.3s	3428.3	 worth a Disney and an NBC?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3431.2s	3431.2	 Or is this worth a Hulu and an NBC?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3434.6s	3434.6	 Streaming service.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3435.5s	3435.5	 Sax, you had some to add?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3436.5s	3436.5	 Well, I mean, I agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3438.0s	3438.0	 I would just add one factor to this, which is what Elon said, which is he said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3442.6s	3442.6	 the woke mind virus is making Netflix unwatchable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3445.4s	3445.4	 I mean, the quality of the programming has gone down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3448.0s	3448.0	 I mean, Netflix used to be really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3450.3s	3450.3	 I can't think of like a show now that I watch on Netflix and I do watch HBO Max
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3456.6s	3456.6	 right now and Disney Plus because they got some shows that I like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3460.5s	3460.5	 So I think somehow the programming people at Netflix have gotten out of touch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3465.5s	3465.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3465.8s	3465.8	 Are they pandering to that audience, Sax, do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3467.9s	3467.9	 And, you know, similar to kind of how Disney ended up pandering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3470.5s	3470.5	 And do you think that there's broadly this kind of media problem of trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3474.4s	3474.4	 pander to the wrong audience?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3476.0s	3476.0	 I mean, they almost threw Chappelle off, who's the number, by far the number one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3479.1s	3479.1	 comic in, you know, in American comedy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3482.0s	3482.0	 And they absolutely would have thrown Chappelle off and done what a lot of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3486.0s	3486.0	 employees wanted if they didn't have such a big deal with him, if he wasn't such a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3489.2s	3489.2	 big deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3489.6s	3489.6	 No, I think they held the line pretty, pretty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3492.1s	3492.1	 There's a lot of groveling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3493.5s	3493.5	 There's a lot of groveling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3494.6s	3494.6	 I mean, I think they reasonably heard the concerns of their employees and said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3498.4s	3498.4	 we reasonably disagree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3499.9s	3499.9	 You cannot see the question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3501.3s	3501.3	 Yeah, but Jason, it showed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3503.7s	3503.7	 But yes, but look, yes, maybe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3506.2s	3506.2	 But what I'm saying is that that episode revealed that the people are doing the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3511.0s	3511.0	 programming at Netflix, obviously, like they're not like, I think they've lost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3515.6s	3515.6	 touch with where most of the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3517.7s	3517.7	 I will give a shout out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3518.7s	3518.7	 I have not watched a series on Netflix in probably a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3522.5s	3522.5	 Oh, no, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3524.7s	3524.7	 But I will give a shout out to Never Have I Ever, which Mindy Kaling created.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3529.0s	3529.0	 She's amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3530.0s	3530.0	 And that series is incredibly funny and poignant and cool and awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3535.0s	3535.0	 But outside of that series, I cannot think of a single reason why I would actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3540.4s	3540.4	 pay for Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3541.6s	3541.6	 Let me ask you guys a question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3542.7s	3542.7	 So going back to because, you know, there was the whole Disney, Pander, HBO, Max,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3546.2s	3546.2	 however. Oh, my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3547.2s	3547.2	 So good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3548.3s	3548.3	 The whole industry is suffering this problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3549.8s	3549.8	 Do you remember the Oscars?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3550.9s	3550.9	 We don't even watch it anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3552.1s	3552.1	 This is the question I have for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3553.8s	3553.8	 Do you guys think that there's a difference culturally in the management of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3559.0s	3559.0	 the media company?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3559.8s	3559.8	 So let's go through them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3560.9s	3560.9	 WarnerMedia, Disney, Netflix, Amazon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3566.0s	3566.0	 And do you think that that cultural difference may create an advantage and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3569.4s	3569.4	 success?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3569.8s	3569.8	 Do you think that WarnerMedia is operating HBO Max differently because they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3574.1s	3574.1	 culturally different?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3575.3s	3575.3	 Yeah, they're culturally different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3576.8s	3576.8	 HBO has always been culturally different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3578.6s	3578.6	 They have been for or tours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3580.8s	3580.8	 HBO has always had.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3581.8s	3581.8	 HBO sucked for years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3583.3s	3583.3	 They got a few good shows now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3584.8s	3584.8	 It's more like luck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3586.4s	3586.4	 They've always been for or tours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3587.6s	3587.6	 They always have gone with the vision of the director, the vision of the writer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3591.6s	3591.6	 and taken a lot of risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3592.9s	3592.9	 When you hear that HBO logo, you know it's going to be a high end or tour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3598.4s	3598.4	 I agree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3598.5s	3598.5	 They have some really good shows right now, but until the last couple of years, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3601.6s	3601.6	 was like pretty dismal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3602.6s	3602.6	 It is a headspace business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3603.0s	3603.0	 But I mean, to Friedberg's point, you know that Netflix is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3606.4s	3606.4	 I would say I would say Disney has Marvel and that's why they have Marvel and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3610.3s	3610.3	 Star Wars and that's and that's kept them extremely relevant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3614.0s	3614.0	 Yes, the IP.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3615.5s	3615.5	 There are I cannot tell you how much and the advantage Disney has is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3620.6s	3620.6	 rewatch ability of their content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3623.0s	3623.0	 I don't know how many times your kids have all watched Moana.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3626.2s	3626.2	 My kids have watched.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3627.1s	3627.1	 I've had to watch Moana one hundred and seven times already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3629.9s	3629.9	 Let's hear it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3630.5s	3630.5	 Let's start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3631.2s	3631.2	 Yeah, and and and you're welcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3634.8s	3634.8	 Yeah, you're welcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3636.0s	3636.0	 And the and the Star Wars content, as you guys know, you could rewatch Star Wars and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3639.3s	3639.3	 Marvel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3639.8s	3639.8	 I mean, like the content is very different on Pixar movies, too.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3646.5s	3646.5	 HBO Max is thrilling and engaging and doesn't feel like it's pandering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3650.9s	3650.9	 HBO right now is operating at the next level.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3681.7s	3681.7	 Ted Lasso, we crashed and then you look at HBO Max with just, you know, you for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3687.8s	3687.8	 way.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagVCXIPIlQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=58&t=3698.3s	3698.3	 HBO is like for adults.
