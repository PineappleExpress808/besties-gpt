https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=13.2s	13.2	 David Freberg announces today hours before the taping of this special Thanksgiving pod
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=19.3s	19.3	 that he is taking metro mile public through a SPAC and that bestie see and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=26.2s	26.2	 Here is the quote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=28.2s	28.2	 That as only Chamath can tweet Buffett had Geico I pick Metro Mile
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=36.6s	36.6	 I would just like to say I'll tell you move markets LeBron James has three rings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=45.6s	45.6	 Freberg tell us what is Metro Mile and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=49.6s	49.6	 Well, this isn't a self-promoting podcast is it I mean no, no, but I think it's just you know, it's your second company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=55.7s	55.7	 I started the company in 2011 when I was running climate when I was the CEO there and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=61.5s	61.5	 You know, we were climate was offering insurance at the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=65.0s	65.0	 We learned a lot about the insurance markets and figured like hey, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=68.7s	68.7	 Telematics or connecting cars to the Internet is gonna be a big deal and we're gonna be able to completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=73.1s	73.1	 Change the auto insurance industry. So we set up this company. I was the chairman from the founding in 2011 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=81.6s	81.6	 You know been been chairman and I've been an active investor in the business in every round since then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=87.0s	87.0	 so the business has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=89.5s	89.5	 built some you know, really compelling value proposition for customers and you know, it's got really good unit economics and it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=97.4s	97.4	 You know needed its last round of capital to get profitable and turns out, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=101.7s	101.7	 as we were thinking about that this summer that a SPAC was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=105.2s	105.2	 Really good path for the business given the inflection point. It's at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=108.8s	108.8	 And the basic premise of the business is instead of paying for insurance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=114.2s	114.2	 By month or time period innovation here is you pay per mile?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=118.2s	118.2	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=118.7s	118.7	 insurance today is like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=119.8s	119.8	 You know you fill out a form and you get a price for insurance you pay that rate for six months of coverage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=124.9s	124.9	 But you know depending on when you're driving and how much you're driving you should be paying a different price, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=129.9s	129.9	 So we we kind of changed the model to a rate per mile
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=133.8s	133.8	 And so if you don't drive you save, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=136.0s	136.0	 So the average customer doesn't drive a lot with metromile
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=138.6s	138.6	 They save 47% over what they were paying with like Geico or progressive reassurance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=143.4s	143.4	 And you do that with that odb port is a little plug-in device and increasingly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=148.0s	148.0	 We're actually doing it directly by connecting to cars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=150.6s	150.6	 Direct through a Ford and a couple other big automotive OEMs now have this ability to send the data directly out of the car
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=157.4s	157.4	 because they're all internet connected now, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=160.0s	160.0	 So that allows us to just basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=161.6s	161.6	 You know see how many miles you're driving and the rate per mile is what we bill you each month times the number of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=165.9s	165.9	 Miles you drove on your on your car and you you didn't mention how you drive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=170.6s	170.6	 I think that was a controversial concept for a while. You know if you speed if you write we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=177.7s	177.7	 roadmap or no that is part of it today, but frankly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=182.3s	182.3	 70% of the price difference you get in auto insurance is from the number of miles you drive only 30% is really in this variance around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=188.4s	188.4	 Behavior you know most people are generally pretty good drivers, so believe it or not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=192.6s	192.6	 So the real variance in terms of you know your risk to the insurance companies how many miles you drive?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=197.8s	197.8	 So that really is the predominant factors if we can accurately track that now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=201.2s	201.2	 What's interesting is like in a world of autonomous cars where you're like turning on the car?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=205.4s	205.4	 To be autonomous or fully self-driving at some point. You know it's on and off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=209.0s	209.0	 You should be getting a different rate for those miles right so if the car is your tesla on autopilot on the freeway that should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=214.8s	214.8	 Be safer than you on the freeway you shouldn't be paying as much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=218.0s	218.0	 Even better you can kind of think about how this moves into a world where everything is dynamically priced and dynamically built
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=224.2s	224.2	 Usage priced yeah usage price and that and also fair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=227.6s	227.6	 So you know if you're a good driver, and you're driving well, or if you're using autonomous features
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=231.8s	231.8	 You shouldn't pay as much and ultimately that translates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=234.6s	234.6	 You know into a truly kind of more dynamic service
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=237.5s	237.5	 And that's really where the world has to go because those low mileage drivers or those good drivers or those drivers using autonomous features
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=243.7s	243.7	 Should be paying considerably less so they'll start using our service and that'll force the other guys to raise their rates and it creates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=250.7s	250.7	 This huge you know kind of market mode
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=253.9s	253.9	 Great when that we're in the we're in the very early days. I mean it's like the first inning still so we're you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=258.5s	258.5	 We're we're just getting going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=260.1s	260.1	 Chum of you chose to do a pipe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=262.6s	262.6	 With the SPAC explain to the audience what a pipe is we both don't know and what you loved about Metro Mile sure I think the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=270.5s	270.5	 What is a pipe a pipe is a?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=273.1s	273.1	 private investment in a public enterprise and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=276.9s	276.9	 Basically what that means is that you're making the round bigger right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=282.2s	282.2	 So it's kind of like Sequoia does your series a and invest 10 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=286.0s	286.0	 I would come in and put another 10 million and now your series a is 20 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=290.8s	290.8	 same terms as the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=293.3s	293.3	 As Sequoia's round except you're now just grossing up the amount of capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=297.9s	297.9	 Why are why is that helpful? Well what it does is it allows?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=301.6s	301.6	 Somebody to price the deal so in this case David SPAC sponsor price the deal did the diligence and decided to underwrite Metro Mile at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=308.9s	308.9	 That price and then they came to me and said hey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=312.6s	312.6	 you know do you want to come and join this round essentially and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=316.2s	316.2	 I got to know the business a lot of things that David said basically are true the the thing that I will say is like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=323.5s	323.5	 You know everybody talks about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=325.5s	325.5	 the value of machine learning right and data oriented learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=330.1s	330.1	 The most obvious thing that you can do is if you learn on top of a huge subset of data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=336.6s	336.6	 especially out in the real world like driving data or any other kind of information is you should be taking risk on top of it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=343.3s	343.3	 This is why sort of these next generation insurance companies to me are so interesting because it's probably where you're gonna see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=350.6s	350.6	 machine learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=351.9s	351.9	 Be used that just massive massive scale because you're just gonna reprice risk and make it as David said much more dynamic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=358.5s	358.5	 So anyways, they showed it to me. I I really like the the product the metrics are really amazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=365.2s	365.2	 And so I joined it's great. I'm really excited for it. I'm really excited for free bird. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=371.4s	371.4	 Congratulations great tomorrow than I've never worked on anything together. So it's awesome. We're doing our first project here on the all-in podcast together

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=384.7s	384.7	 I read it like to be here for me in sacks. Yeah, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=390.3s	390.3	 Jason do you know about this? I don't know anything. I get I'm the last one out of it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=422.6s	422.6	 Back a little share let's Jason. Why don't you start an angel is syndicate for every all-in podcast listener?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=429.4s	429.4	 Yes, all in podcast syndicate. It will be on the syndicate comm I love you ageless, but yeah, okay

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=435.4s	435.4	 Thus syndicate comm slash all in podcast and then we'll aggregate all these subscribers

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=742.6s	742.6	 I don't know if it was Fauci or someone that's closer to the operation shared that they do think they can get 70% of Americans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=748.8s	748.8	 Immunized by May so my may yeah, so you know if you'll remember a few podcasts ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=755.1s	755.1	 I think I tried to explain a big part of the budget that went into this operation warp speed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=760.0s	760.0	 Was to parallelize production of these vaccines while they were being tested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=763.5s	763.5	 And so we've been scaling up the production and the manufacturing of these and if they weren't gonna work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=768.2s	768.2	 We're just gonna crash them right a couple billion dollars who cares. It's a good option for the American people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=773.2s	773.2	 So we've got a ton of doses that have been produced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=776.4s	776.4	 It's about packaging and distribution now and that's you know supposed to be kind of underway with the plan to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=781.7s	781.7	 That on December 11th or 12 when they give the emergency use authorization these doses start showing up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=788.1s	788.1	 In can we went all in we basically went all in blind like we just shoved the chips in and said we're gonna make these vaccines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=794.0s	794.0	 You know, it's more like it's more like us a spray and pray
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=798.4s	798.4	 Angel investment portfolio, you know, we bought a but we bought like four different things or five different things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=803.8s	803.8	 We made it bets in all of them and hope that one of them pays off and it turns out they're all gonna pay off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=807.9s	807.9	 So, you know or chunk of them are gonna pay off and we get to have them ready
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=812.5s	812.5	 You know in time to kind of make a difference here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=814.8s	814.8	 Now all that being said if you look at the case numbers in the US right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=819.3s	819.3	 We could be as high as 30% of the American people have already been infected with coronavirus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=825.8s	825.8	 Based on some estimates. So as of the June 30th
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=829.8s	829.8	 Paper that was published from those dialysis patients and they did a pretty good statistical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=834.7s	834.7	 Interpretation of looking at antibodies and people's blood they estimate 10% of the American population was infected by coronavirus as of June 30th
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=842.7s	842.7	 And then if you look at the number of people that have been infected since then and you apply the similar sort of multiple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=847.5s	847.5	 That you would assume based on tests
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=849.6s	849.6	 You know, there's an estimate that we could already be at up to 30% of the US population has been infected Wow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=855.7s	855.7	 And therefore immune and they're theoretically mostly immune. Let's just say that right and so we sure there's anecdotes and so on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=862.0s	862.0	 But yeah, let's just say generally yes immune
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=864.1s	864.1	 And so you combine that with these vaccines starting to roll out and we get you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=868.7s	868.7	 Pretty kind of comfortable position in terms of the pandemic and hopefully a couple of months here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=874.3s	874.3	 And that's why the markets going nuts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=876.0s	876.0	 And that's why everyone I mean, I don't know about you guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=877.9s	877.9	 But I got some conference invites this last week for conferences for next year that had been canceled this year and we're really on hold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=883.9s	883.9	 Yeah, so, oh wow people are starting to lean for what time frame third quarter or fourth quarter summer July
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=890.2s	890.2	 Yeah, so people are now assuming that and they're booking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=893.9s	893.9	 Hotel spaces based on it that is extraordinary sacks you shared this New York Times story
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=899.6s	899.6	 Why don't you summarize it for the audience and I'd love to get your thoughts in addition to this as to what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=906.4s	906.4	 this recovery might look like if in fact we have more vaccine than we need and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=912.8s	912.8	 Even you know a reasonable number of Americans take it and don't believe that it's a conspiracy theory by Bill Gates to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=919.2s	919.2	 control and the Illuminati
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=921.9s	921.9	 Yeah, I mean this New York Times story is pretty remarkable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=924.6s	924.6	 It's called politics science and that are markable race for a coronavirus vaccine. This came out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=930.1s	930.1	 I think just came out today in the New York Times actually sorry, it's published it published November 21st updated November 24th
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=938.6s	938.6	 And it's pretty remarkable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=940.8s	940.8	 it describes the effort by operation warp speed by the administration by Pfizer by the Durnett kind of gives you the behind-the-scenes play-by-play and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=949.8s	949.8	 reading the article you have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=952.6s	952.6	 Come away thinking that the Trump administration did a pretty good job with this whole warp speed project
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=958.9s	958.9	 I don't know if the New York Times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=962.7s	962.7	 Realizes that is making the Trump administration look so good or maybe they don't care anymore because he's lost the election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=968.6s	968.6	 But the article does make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=971.5s	971.5	 The administration looked very good. I mean competent very confident first of all they shoveled money to the right people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=978.0s	978.0	 They you know, they offered Pfizer money Pfizer didn't want it or need it, but Moderna did so they got a few billion dollars Moderna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=985.4s	985.4	 They parallel processed a bunch of different attempts here so that if one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=990.6s	990.6	 Company failed the others might succeed there was a sort of a Reaganite cutting of bureaucratic red tape wherever they could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=998.1s	998.1	 There were examples in the story of the drug company needing something some supplies or what have you and they would call the administration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1005.5s	1005.5	 They would you know make it happen and then finally the administration did do anything to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1011.1s	1011.1	 To kind of mess with the science, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1013.9s	1013.9	 in fact, they describe how this the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1017.3s	1017.3	 This new experimental mRNA technique that they used to generate the vaccine. They had the code for that within two days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1025.6s	1025.6	 They actually had the vaccine sort of printed if you will within weeks and really what took all this time were the human trials
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1034.5s	1034.5	 with you know, the three stage human trials which the administration did not do anything to speed up and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1039.6s	1039.6	 probably the irony of ironies the supreme irony is there's a story there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1043.9s	1043.9	 there's a bit in the story it actually begins with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1047.7s	1047.7	 This guy's sloughy who's the head of the Trump administration's effort to produce the vaccine. He actually slowed down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1054.8s	1054.8	 The Moderna human trials by about three weeks because they weren't including enough minorities in the you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1061.7s	1061.7	 In the in the trial and that cost him three weeks if it weren't for those three weeks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1067.5s	1067.5	 Moderna's vaccine would have happened before Pfizer and it would have come out about a week before the election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1072.6s	1072.6	 so you got to wonder like Trump has got to be pulling out his hair about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1078.9s	1078.9	 What hair about about about this twist of fate David? How does it attribute credit for warp speed?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1085.6s	1085.6	 And I can I'm going someplace with this. So I'm just asking you the question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1088.8s	1088.8	 Well, I don't the article is not trying to attribute credit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1092.3s	1092.3	 they're just kind of describing the behind the scenes of how Pfizer Moderna came up with their vaccines and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1098.2s	1098.2	 It just but but in describing, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1102.4s	1102.4	 Pfizer Moderna did the work of creating the vaccine but in describing the ways that warp speed contributed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1107.5s	1107.5	 They did things that were only helpful and nothing that was harmful. And so in that sense it made the Trump administration look quite good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1113.8s	1113.8	 Yeah, I think the point is that the the warp speed folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1117.7s	1117.7	 Which is probably the least well-known working group working on coronavirus to the rest of the public is because it was a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1124.1s	1124.1	 Wonky insiders it was sign of almost proving the exact opposite of what Trump typically does which is, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1130.4s	1130.4	 Some idiotic nepotistic leaning where it's his daughter or it's his son-in-law running around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1135.8s	1135.8	 You know completely and effectively, you know doing something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1140.9s	1140.9	 Where they become sort of front and center for taking credit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1144.5s	1144.5	 In this case, it was just a bunch of policy wonks you never heard about the project
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1148.1s	1148.1	 We only know about work speed because a handful of us have talked about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1151.4s	1151.4	 And it turns out to actually have been good because they knew what they were doing and they do enough to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1156.1s	1156.1	 To not try to seek the credit and just got out of the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1158.4s	1158.4	 I mean it proves almost the antithesis of how the Trump campaign, you know manage their time in the White House
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1164.4s	1164.4	 Well, I mean you have a point where you know, I was kind of reading this article wondering, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1169.4s	1169.4	 Where was Jared Kushner because if Kushner knew about this, there's no way he slows down the Moderna vaccine by three weeks. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1176.8s	1176.8	 Mean that might have made the difference right there and whether Trump wins or not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1181.1s	1181.1	 Can you imagine the effect on the election if the vaccine had come out one week before November 3rd decide?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1186.5s	1186.5	 I think Trump would have won decidedly if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1189.3s	1189.3	 He had a vaccine or two out with 90%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1192.2s	1192.2	 But I think he had no credibility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1194.5s	1194.5	 Even though Moderna and Pfizer were saying late November and he said the vaccines are around the corner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1200.1s	1200.1	 His whole tenure was based on so much lying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1203.9s	1203.9	 He was the boy who cried wolf
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1205.5s	1205.5	 He was the president who cried wolf by the time he told the truth and he was telling the truth about the vaccines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1212.4s	1212.4	 He it was like oh my lord. He he told the truth in the final three months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1217.6s	1217.6	 Well, can I give you the opposite David of that which is that if Moderna basically says hey guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1222.8s	1222.8	 We have a vaccine that works for white people and a disease that's you know disproportionately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1228.3s	1228.3	 Killing blacks and you know Hispanics and brown people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1232.8s	1232.8	 Native Americans and all of a sudden people are like wait, what the fuck?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1237.1s	1237.1	 Maybe they would have gone into Georgia and they would have just crushed them even more and then you would have actually had the Senate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1241.7s	1241.7	 flip too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1242.1s	1242.1	 so you could have had a whole kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1244.1s	1244.1	 Distribution of outcomes there in a different case because you could have had an angry reaction as well. We don't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1250.6s	1250.6	 I guess is my well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1253.0s	1253.0	 Yeah, I mean I think it's ironic that an administration that was constantly accused of white supremacy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1260.4s	1260.4	 Probably lost the election because they slowed down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1264.0s	1264.0	 This vaccine trial group to include more minorities. No, I know but I think what we're saying is it wasn't the actual administration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1271.1s	1271.1	 It was somebody you know, we know what they were doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1274.1s	1274.1	 We call that redemption in the movie when the person actually loses because they did the right thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1279.3s	1279.3	 It's kind of redemption freeburg when you look at these mRNA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1283.1s	1283.1	 Vaccines you were educating us about them last night
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1286.5s	1286.5	 And also for a long time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1291.0s	1291.0	 Tell the audience just one more time how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1294.2s	1294.2	 These work briefly and what the potential for them is in the future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1298.5s	1298.5	 Because I think a lot of us now are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1302.4s	1302.4	 This is gonna be over. We're gonna be at conferences or going traveling to Europe or whatever it is next summer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1308.3s	1308.3	 But we are all gonna be scarred for life thinking, you know, when is the next coronavirus?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1313.6s	1313.6	 Just like for a decade we we were on pins and needles. When is the next 9-eleven? So this is gonna be scar tissue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1319.9s	1319.9	 for a generation or two of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1322.2s	1322.2	 When the next kovat comes how quickly will warp speed 2.0 go? Yeah, it's it's a it's the right question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1330.0s	1330.0	 Because our approach to doing vaccines may have just changed permanently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1334.9s	1334.9	 So, you know every cell has your DNA and DNA basically codes proteins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1340.8s	1340.8	 Every three letters of DNA makes an amino acid codes for a specific amino acid. There's 20 amino acids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1347.6s	1347.6	 the way that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1348.6s	1348.6	 There's 20 amino acids the way that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1351.4s	1351.4	 DNA turns into proteins is through RNA. So RNA is kind of like a mirror copy of your DNA it floats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1357.5s	1357.5	 Into these things called ribosomes in your cells and outcome proteins and those it's like a printer, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1362.5s	1362.5	 And so those those ribosomes make your proteins using those amino acid sequences coded by the RNA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1368.1s	1368.1	 so the way that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1370.5s	1370.5	 Vaccines work historically is you'll get a dead virus, which is basically the protein of a virus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1376.1s	1376.1	 Your immune system then learns to kill that or to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1379.5s	1379.5	 that protein
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1381.4s	1381.4	 Oh man, Jesus my dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1383.4s	1383.4	 Your immune system then learns to remove that protein from your body and that's how you develop this memory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1389.7s	1389.7	 Your immune memory to a specific protein and so they put this dead art vaccine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1393.9s	1393.9	 But virus in your body and hopefully your immune system learns a good response to it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1398.0s	1398.0	 mRNA basically puts the RNA in your body that codes for that protein
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1402.9s	1402.9	 Your cells then make that protein and because it's making a lot more of the protein in a more consistent, you know way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1409.8s	1409.8	 Theoretically, the idea is your body develops a much more robust immune memory and immune response without it overloading your system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1416.4s	1416.4	 What all the immune cells try and wipe that protein out right away and so on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1420.3s	1420.3	 The the challenge is you're putting RNA in your body and we've always been worried about we don't know what the side effects of mixing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1425.3s	1425.3	 RNA in your body would be is it going to change your DNA? Is it going to change your genetic makeup?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1428.9s	1428.9	 Is it going to cause other deleterious side effects?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1431.3s	1431.3	 So this technology this capability this knowledge has been around forever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1434.7s	1434.7	 I'm not forever but for you know a long time and the idea has always been we could use RNA in this way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1439.3s	1439.3	 But you know, no one wanted and we've used it in animals and we've used it in plants and we've seen the capabilities of using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1444.5s	1444.5	 RNA to do different things like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1446.5s	1446.5	 But um, this is a big leap and so, uh, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1449.9s	1449.9	 We kind of leapt forward here of getting to the point that we felt comfortable with, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1453.8s	1453.8	 RNA is a as a treatment like this and it's um, it's working
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1456.6s	1456.6	 So in theory in the future as sax points out you could take any virus or any bacteria
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1460.9s	1460.9	 You could read its dna you do that in an hour
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1463.5s	1463.5	 Then you could take chunks of that dna and code RNA for it so your body makes those proteins of theoretically produced in immune response
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1469.0s	1469.0	 So that that's the that's the science of like how do you how do you create a new vaccine?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1473.6s	1473.6	 I think that's the amazing part is the way it's described
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1477.2s	1477.2	 You know in this article is that's almost like laser printing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1480.5s	1480.5	 or 3d printing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1482.1s	1482.1	 A vaccine is kind of like the equivalent of that. You just take the genome of the virus and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1487.6s	1487.6	 You know boom you've got the vaccine and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1490.4s	1490.4	 All the other delay is about human trials and testing of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1494.4s	1494.4	 But imagine if that there there was the next coronavirus is 10 times as deadly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1499.6s	1499.6	 you know something that's as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1501.4s	1501.4	 spreads as contagiously as smallpox and as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1505.1s	1505.1	 You know as deadly as Ebola or something like that. We could have a vaccine the next day, you know, like you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1511.3s	1511.3	 We we could have a very challenge david would be as we'd have it the next day like we did here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1516.2s	1516.2	 But we would be going through this three-phase trial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1518.7s	1518.7	 And so I want to take a moment here and talk to shamath about something which is challenge trials
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1524.2s	1524.2	 Um in the uk they will start doing challenge trials for those people who don't know what a challenge trial is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1529.5s	1529.5	 essentially they expose you to something dangerous i.e. a virus like covid and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1535.7s	1535.7	 They give you the vaccine and then they give you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1539.2s	1539.2	 Uh the virus as opposed to how we do a three-phase trial, which is you give the the vaccine to 30 000 people and a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1546.7s	1546.7	 Placebo to 30 000 and then you come back three months later and see how many people got infected and it takes time and money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1552.4s	1552.4	 Whereas challenge trials
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1554.3s	1554.3	 Only take risk on the individuals who are part of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1557.4s	1557.4	 Shamatha hundreds of people in the science community
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1560.7s	1560.7	 Signed a letter and in the uk they're going to be doing the first challenge trials in january
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1565.1s	1565.1	 The united states is not doing these i'm certain china is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1568.1s	1568.1	 Um, do you think it's a moment in time where we need to think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1573.0s	1573.0	 About the ethics and morality of challenge trials specifically and then if so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1578.5s	1578.5	 How do you execute them with that? How do you execute a challenge trial without it being unfair?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1584.0s	1584.0	 Um or too dangerous for people obviously you're not going to just go into a prison and say hey anybody want to get 10 years off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1588.9s	1588.9	 The sentence during the challenge trial that seems morally bankrupt, but we let people climb mountains without ropes. So right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1596.0s	1596.0	 Well, I think this speaks to a whole bunch of other issues that we've talked about on the pod before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1601.5s	1601.5	 You know another example of this was section 230 before when we talked about it. We had a body of law
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1607.4s	1607.4	 That was created at a moment of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1610.1s	1610.1	 That essentially was about framing and understanding a specific pathway and a way to use technologies that today look archaic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1617.9s	1617.9	 And we have to rewrite the laws in order to just compensate and understand for where we are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1623.6s	1623.6	 So if I if you double click on trials as an example, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1626.8s	1626.8	 If you have a solution for a rare disease
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1629.4s	1629.4	 You can go in a specific pathway with the fda and get breakthrough and fast track approval
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1634.1s	1634.1	 But if you for example have uh, you know a novel immunotherapy cancer drug you probably you cannot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1639.8s	1639.8	 You know, you have to do a multi-phase trial a typical three-phase trial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1643.1s	1643.1	 You have to solve for very typical things like fatigue etc, etc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1647.7s	1647.7	 All these things slow progress down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1650.9s	1650.9	 Now in a world where we were somewhat flying blind 40 or 50 years ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1655.4s	1655.4	 We didn't have you know things like crisper. We didn't have, you know a real understanding of the genome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1661.7s	1661.7	 We didn't have delivery mechanisms like karti. You would say, okay. Yeah, we should be really really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1667.5s	1667.5	 careful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1668.7s	1668.7	 Um, but I would say that the more you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1671.7s	1671.7	 Um, the more you can ease up on the rules because you can actually empower people with a lot of information
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1678.1s	1678.1	 And it shouldn't take a disaster scenario for us to be iterative and experimental
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1683.7s	1683.7	 So I think the challenge trial is really important. I think the concept of them make a lot of sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1689.0s	1689.0	 I think a lot of government should employ incentives to figure out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1694.0s	1694.0	 Who is eligible and why but if you're a healthy adult male or female and you want to participate in a trial?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1700.7s	1700.7	 for whatever set of reasons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1702.7s	1702.7	 You should be allowed to do so and companies that want to run those trials should be allowed to run them similarly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1709.5s	1709.5	 If you want to find a complementary pathway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1712.7s	1712.7	 Through regulatory agencies to get drugs to the starting line. You should be able to do those too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1717.8s	1717.8	 And I think what we have to do is multi-path
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1721.7s	1721.7	 These compounds going forward because I think that's where you accelerate all these technologies is ability to actually solve these diseases
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1728.0s	1728.0	 Freiburg, why is it so controversial that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1731.4s	1731.4	 A rocket ship company or you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1736.1s	1736.1	 People who want to climb on mountains without ropes or a rocket ship company like there are experimental pilots. We have astronauts they take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1742.9s	1742.9	 unbelievable risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1744.6s	1744.6	 we send
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1745.8s	1745.8	 thousands of troops into harm's way for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1749.0s	1749.0	 Many different reasons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1750.7s	1750.7	 Many of which sadly die and they volunteer for those activities. Those people are volunteering and compensated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1757.7s	1757.7	 But when we look at science and we look at a challenge trial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1761.4s	1761.4	 Scientists say this is morally reprehensible to compensate somebody for taking risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1767.4s	1767.4	 When that's exactly what we do in the army, we do it with police officers and we do it with astronauts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1772.6s	1772.6	 Help us understand how scientists think so differently than say war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1777.5s	1777.5	 I don't know if it's scientists as much as it is, you know regulatory framework like the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1783.4s	1783.4	 Some people would call it a nanny state and you know, there are things that the nanny state assumes individuals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1790.7s	1790.7	 Uh don't have the capacity to understand the extent of the potential loss or the or the nature of the risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1797.5s	1797.5	 This is true for angel investing right? You have to be a qualified investor to invest in a private company without appropriate disclosures
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1803.9s	1803.9	 and it's true in a lot of other contexts, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1807.4s	1807.4	 You know to give people the authority to make decisions like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1811.5s	1811.5	 It seems like my i'm I have no point of view that i'm kind of making here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1815.1s	1815.1	 but it seems like the the the the the the the government assumes or the the elected officials assume or the populace assumes that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1822.4s	1822.4	 There are things that people aren't really equipped to make decisions on because they can't understand the risk because they're not qualified
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1828.1s	1828.1	 And uh that and they get excluded from those activities, but sacks is the uh, it's just how should we reframe this? Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1835.8s	1835.8	 Well, I think how should we frame it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1837.8s	1837.8	 I think assumption of risk is is a is a really good principle and it is a way for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1844.0s	1844.0	 people to engage in potentially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1847.4s	1847.4	 Harmful behaviors just because the behavior is is potentially harmful doesn't mean you don't get to do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1852.3s	1852.3	 Um in the united states you're allowed to do things that are manifestly harmful to yourself like smoking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1858.2s	1858.2	 Well, you know you assume even worse if you're in oregon, you can now do all kinds of hard drugs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1863.8s	1863.8	 I mean you can assume that risk for yourself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1865.5s	1865.5	 So, you know if in portland oregon you can now take heroin openly in the street with no consequence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1871.5s	1871.5	 But you can't participate in a trial that could basically cure a cancer. That's insane to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1877.9s	1877.9	 I'll tell you the script. Yeah, i'll tell you i'll tell you the flip side of it. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1882.6s	1882.6	 You're allowed in nevada to play roulette. I mean what the fuck like, you know, it's got a negative expected value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1889.1s	1889.1	 Statistically factually for individuals, but the individual doesn't have the capacity generally speaking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1894.1s	1894.1	 That's playing roulette to recognize that every dollar they're spending at the roulette table is likely going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1898.8s	1898.8	 You know taken away from them like there's some percentage of that that's going to be taken away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1902.4s	1902.4	 There's a five percentage for the house on that on that game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1905.9s	1905.9	 And um, and so we make the argument in some cases that people don't have the capacity to understand risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1910.7s	1910.7	 But in other cases, it's okay for them to not have the capacity to take risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1915.0s	1915.0	 And I think that there is this notion of what some people call regulatory capture that probably encompasses both of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1920.3s	1920.3	 Which is that there is some degree of profiteering that has created some set of laws
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1924.5s	1924.5	 That kind of manifestly capture that system in a certain way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1928.3s	1928.3	 So there are profitable casino enterprises that say let's get people to spend their money in a risky way that they don't understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1934.6s	1934.6	 And that becomes the law and then people in nevada are allowed to do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1937.7s	1937.7	 There are also pharmaceutical companies that will say we need to have huge regulatory burdens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=1941.9s	1941.9	 So once we make that big investment and we get patent approval and we can lock in that drug

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2429.2s	2429.2	 A regulatory body and infrastructure that actually has changed with the times. I think the sec

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2449.1s	2449.1	 Is just deconstruct this kind of nanny state and say people can become educated and make good decisions for themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2455.3s	2455.3	 And because it's in some it's an area that's relatively benign i.e investing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2460.3s	2460.3	 People kind of just let it happen without a lot of pushback and everybody kind of generally supports it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2495.2s	2495.2	 And you were blocking the poor from having an opportunity to advance like what if apple store employees could get their paycheck and say

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2526.0s	2526.0	 Yes, what you're discussing is like a very really kind of classical republican reaganite idea, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2532.6s	2532.6	 I I agree and and and I think what's going to happen is I think you're going to continue to see deregulation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2538.6s	2538.6	 in areas that are

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2542.5s	2542.5	 So I think the sec
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2546.1s	2546.1	 The fcc, I think all of these places you'll see movement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2550.8s	2550.8	 Um, I think you'll probably actually see a lot more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2554.5s	2554.5	 choice, um and deregulation effectively in um

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2561.8s	2561.8	 I think those places will move first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2564.4s	2564.4	 And then I think it'll be up to some leader politician
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2569.4s	2569.4	 To then really rally the troops on some higher order bits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2572.9s	2572.9	 Um, and one of the biggest higher order bits would be sort of around the broader health care infrastructure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2578.1s	2578.1	 Um social security education education education is probably the biggest one. That's that's like the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2584.8s	2584.8	 It's just too sacrosanct for the democrats. You cannot get elected without the teachers. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2589.2s	2589.2	 Unless there is a startup that completely disrupts teacher pay

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2595.8s	2595.8	 Then the public school teachers unions will continue to dominate a lot of the federal and uh state policy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2605.1s	2605.1	 For the worst, unfortunately freeberg if you had one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2608.7s	2608.7	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2610.1s	2610.1	 Regulation or series of regulations or regulatory body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2614.0s	2614.0	 You would most like to see change for the good of humanity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2618.6s	2618.6	 And you know americans and the rest of the humans on the planet. What would it be? Um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2623.5s	2623.5	 I'd probably help. Uh, yeah, probably the drug process the drug development process, you know, there was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2631.2s	2631.2	 Um a gene editing, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2634.9s	2634.9	 Program that ran and someone died
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2638.6s	2638.6	 This was what year was this?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2642.8s	2642.8	 And they basically halted all gene editing programs for 13 years, you know, how many people died during that time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2648.9s	2648.9	 It was fucking it's a crazy crazy. Um, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2652.9s	2652.9	 fact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2654.4s	2654.4	 Where you know, they're the um, you know, the one death is too many rule
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2659.7s	2659.7	 Um, you know basically doesn't take into account the uh, the kind of broader implications
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2664.8s	2664.8	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2665.9s	2665.9	 On the downside. So yeah, I think that one's probably pretty important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2669.6s	2669.6	 But you know, there's a good interview if you want to hear some interesting thoughts and i'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2675.1s	2675.1	 again, uh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2676.2s	2676.2	 Not trying to be an advocate for any political point of view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2678.9s	2678.9	 But um charles coke goes on tim ferris. Have you guys heard this podcast interview? I've listened to it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2684.6s	2684.6	 Yeah, and he highlights a couple of really good examples about this regulatory capture problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2689.1s	2689.1	 Like if you're poor and you want to become a hairdresser and you know start a salon or go work in a salon and make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2695.8s	2695.8	 money cutting hair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2697.4s	2697.4	 The cost and the burden for you to go get the necessary approvals from the cosmetician
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2702.6s	2702.6	 Association
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2703.9s	2703.9	 Is too burdensome for you know, the average person who's poor needs to become a hairdresser
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2709.3s	2709.3	 And it's just insane that you can't just go be a hairdresser
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2713.1s	2713.1	 Um, the government government needs to ensure that people don't get bad haircuts. It's worse. It's worse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2719.7s	2719.7	 Yeah, you could you you can you don't need a license to be the engineer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2724.1s	2724.1	 That writes the machine learning code that either drives a car autonomously or that you know, uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2731.0s	2731.0	 Helps propel disinformation in a social network, but you do need to have a license to give someone a buzz cut
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2737.2s	2737.2	 Oh, that's a bingo statement right there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2739.7s	2739.7	 Yeah, I mean in fairness. I'm I am checking out sax's new haircut here and i'm kind of thinking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2745.2s	2745.2	 So there should be more regulation. They're my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2747.8s	2747.8	 I was practicing without a license
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2749.8s	2749.8	 You were I mean, yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2752.3s	2752.3	 We can't see the result of this you may want to think this one through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2755.7s	2755.7	 Sax sax you're so you're so white and pale you're you're blending into the background shade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2760.5s	2760.5	 It's impossible to see where your skin ends your hair starts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2766.5s	2766.5	 But I feel like the the regulatory if you think about the framework, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2770.0s	2770.0	 It extends into education too like you can't go get an entry-level job without a quote-unquote college degree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2775.6s	2775.6	 How fucking useful is a college philosophy degree to someone that's trying to get an entry-level job working at x y or z bank, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2781.7s	2781.7	 Like it's um, it's a bit absurd that the structure is set up so that there are whether it's you know government or not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2788.2s	2788.2	 But there is effectively a hurdle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2791.0s	2791.0	 which is this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2792.6s	2792.6	 Alternative to regulatory capture, but it's like call it embedded system, you know capture like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2797.9s	2797.9	 There is a significant kind of hurdle that you have to get through that costs a lot and the point of entry has gotten too high
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2803.1s	2803.1	 For most and it really stalls things out and it's going to cause more damage than good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2807.3s	2807.3	 Well, and it's also been completely disconnected from the reality of your employment potential people are going into debt for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2814.1s	2814.1	 $200,000 in a liberal arts degree that provides no scale that is do we all agree that makes sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2819.6s	2819.6	 Like does anyone on this in this group argue for needing a bachelor's degree for everyone? No, like I don't think I I think I think it's useless
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2828.1s	2828.1	 What do you guys think of isa's income sharing agreements? These have become kind of lambda school does them a bunch of other schools
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2835.4s	2835.4	 David you saw a startup we just invested in that's doing them and I think you like them at the demo day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2839.7s	2839.7	 We did uh with craft maybe you know, this idea is who should take the risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2845.5s	2845.5	 for an education and when you look at an isa an income sharing agreement what they're saying is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2850.1s	2850.1	 Uh, the school takes the risk they let you come to school for free. They give you what would be the equivalent of let's say a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2856.2s	2856.2	 $15,000 coding camp or growth marketer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2860.4s	2860.4	 Risk then you pay double that amount over five six seven years as a percentage of your income
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2866.5s	2866.5	 But if you don't get income if you don't break 50k a year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2869.3s	2869.3	 You don't have to pay it back

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2932.2s	2932.2	 Allergic reaction to income sharing agreements when they were first talked about they called them indentured servitude
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2937.5s	2937.5	 Modern slavery and it was like oh my god. Oh so insulting to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2941.4s	2941.4	 But it's different than signing a contract with an agent to represent you when you first start out in any industry music or or sports or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2948.8s	2948.8	 Uh film or whatever one you could sign an agency agreement where the agent is your rep for 10 20 years, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2953.8s	2953.8	 I mean some of those agreements can have long tails on them and that's effectively the same, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2959.1s	2959.1	 It's even worse. I say he's had a cap. Look at look at uh, we can talk about this in a second
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2963.0s	2963.0	 But like, you know, did you see what happened with chapelle the last couple of days where oh, yeah, let's go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2968.1s	2968.1	 Did you watch the video I loved it yeah, the video is incredible video is incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2972.0s	2972.0	 So the the the quick story on this is chapelle basically did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2975.4s	2975.4	 Um, he had a request he went to netflix and he said take down chapelle show netflix took it down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2980.8s	2980.8	 And he did a little stand-up. It's on his instagram. It's like 18 minutes. It's it's fabulous as most chapelle stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2987.2s	2987.2	 peak chapelle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2988.2s	2988.2	 And he basically told this story which essentially the punch line is like, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2992.4s	2992.4	 He signed a contract where he just got completely fucked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=2996.1s	2996.1	 And he's like this is happening every single day in so many markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3001.7s	3001.7	 And so the idea that then you have actually a different market which disrupts something by actually creating transparency and something reasonable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3010.0s	3010.0	 Is all of a sudden completely immoral makes no sense to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3013.2s	3013.2	 So there's abuses happening all the time that is what the contract that chapelle signed was indentured servitude
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3020.0s	3020.0	 He doesn't even have the rights to his name
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3022.5s	3022.5	 He cannot if they took his name and likeness right? Yeah, if you wanted to create the dave chapelle show again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3026.5s	3026.5	 He's actually called the dc show, but this is a perfect somebody owns his name. What the fuck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3032.1s	3032.1	 In perpetuity in all mediums and platforms forever. This is a perfect tie back to the earlier statement about uh, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3038.0s	3038.0	 Do you have the appropriate kind of um understanding of the risk you're taking or the benefit that you're getting?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3043.8s	3043.8	 Um, I think kanya has been doing this whole thing about he doesn't own the masters to his music originally, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3049.0s	3049.0	 At the moment that he signed that contract when he signed over all the masters, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3053.5s	3053.5	 The master recordings and all the future revenue rights to his music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3056.7s	3056.7	 He was getting paid a ton of money in his mind at that time. He said oh my gosh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3060.4s	3060.4	 I'm getting whatever it was. Let's say it's five million dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3062.5s	3062.5	 I'm getting five million dollars the most amount of money i've ever seen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3065.2s	3065.2	 It is absolutely worth me giving over the masters of this music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3068.8s	3068.8	 And the future royalty rights to this music for 12 songs or whatever it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3072.6s	3072.6	 For me to get five million dollars today and I can live an amazing life and it'll change everything for me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3077.3s	3077.3	 Who is to say that he was not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3079.7s	3079.7	 You know of the appropriate sound mind and understanding to decide in that moment to take that five million dollars and give up all future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3085.9s	3085.9	 royalties to his music well chapelle's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3088.5s	3088.5	 chapelle's argument was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3090.5s	3090.5	 The people who are in that ecosystem are all friends. They're all working together and they've commoditized the artist and they collude
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3098.3s	3098.3	 to do this kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3100.4s	3100.4	 upside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3101.4s	3101.4	 Limiting deals and I think what makes silicon valley so special is that we collude the other direction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3107.2s	3107.2	 We want people to have equity participation and we want the social contract of silicon valley is i'm giving you equity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3113.7s	3113.7	 I hope your your penny stock becomes worth 1500 dollars and that you create multi-generational wealth and you become an angel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3121.1s	3121.1	 But I don't know look if I if i'm an angel investor or want to be an angel investor and some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3125.7s	3125.7	 Schmo tricks me into investing in his shitty company and I just lose 20 000 dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3130.1s	3130.1	 But I didn't know how to determine whether that company was shitty or not because i've never done investing before read my book
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3134.8s	3134.8	 Is it for the government to regulate that circumstance and say you know what you need to be a quote-unquote qualified investor to be able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3140.2s	3140.2	 To discern a good company for a bad company or bullshit from not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3143.5s	3143.5	 And the same and the same for these contracts, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3145.5s	3145.5	 like I mean, so, you know, we're making the argument I think for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3148.9s	3148.9	 The you know the regulatory framework for preventing people from being able to have freedom of choice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3154.2s	3154.2	 And I think like earlier, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3155.7s	3155.7	 The case was made like people should be able to make have freedom of choice at any point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3159.5s	3159.5	 Why should the government kind of step in and make a decision for me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3161.9s	3161.9	 I think that there i'm not i'm not advocating advocating for government intervention. My my only point is that there are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3167.9s	3167.9	 morally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3169.1s	3169.1	 Reprehensible things that are happening today using contracts and that you know something like an income sharing agreement actually rights the ship in so many ways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3177.3s	3177.3	 That's definitely the burden of capitalism. Ultimately, you know, it it devolves to that right where like oh you're sick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3183.0s	3183.0	 You have cancer pay me a million dollars i'll give you this drug so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3187.0s	3187.0	 Hollywood's a little bit of its own beast where there's all these gatekeepers and the gatekeepers are always trying to get control over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3193.9s	3193.9	 You know the creative product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3195.8s	3195.8	 And so yeah, like, you know signing contracts with those sharks is always a dangerous thing to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3202.7s	3202.7	 Um, I think silica valley is very different. We have much more of a culture of of equity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3207.3s	3207.3	 I think the income sharing agreements are much more in that vein
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3210.8s	3210.8	 And I think they're a great idea for like any trade that demonstrably increases your earning power, right? So the beauty of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3218.2s	3218.2	 lambda school is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3220.0s	3220.0	 They pay for you to get an education being a coder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3223.9s	3223.9	 It then increases your salary and they get a piece of that. That's like a win-win for everybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3228.6s	3228.6	 I think where this goes if these isas are successful is that every trade?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3233.2s	3233.2	 That's valuable will get its own isa type school
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3237.5s	3237.5	 And then that gets peeled out of a university education
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3241.3s	3241.3	 So what's left for colleges to do it's basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3244.8s	3244.8	 You know all the stuff that doesn't add value. They're museums. They're they're basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3248.7s	3248.7	 Like these monasteries again, right? They go back to being monasteries not places where you get skills
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3254.0s	3254.0	 We need to set we need to celebrate vocational capability because I think like, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3258.3s	3258.3	 We have we have so celebrated this mythical bachelor's degree and it just means fucking nothing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3264.8s	3264.8	 It like it doesn't learn a trade and that's just as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3268.7s	3268.7	 Frankly, that should be as respected or more but in the american culture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3273.0s	3273.0	 You don't do that right now. I've never understood that if you go for example to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3277.3s	3277.3	 Different countries around the world europe's a good example actually of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3281.0s	3281.0	 Because it's the closest analog in terms of quality of living to america. There's a real celebration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3286.4s	3286.4	 of uh people who choose vocational tradecraft because there's an entire educational infrastructure that you can onboard yourself into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3292.9s	3292.9	 You can become a skilled person and you can have a really good decent life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3297.4s	3297.4	 And there's pride in the work and there's pride in that work and in america
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3301.6s	3301.6	 You know you covet this piece of paper the piece of paper is really just a scam
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3306.1s	3306.1	 That allows, you know administrators to basically pay themselves millions of dollars and or run an asset management business

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3350.0s	3350.0	 Inside of one of these trade schools, they spend 50 other time on placement 50 on education
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3355.9s	3355.9	 and that at a college they spend 99.x amount of time on

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3631.2s	3631.2	 Well, what what basically happened is you you know, you had rudy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3635.6s	3635.6	 And sydney pal and you know that legal team going to court to try and challenge all these rules the whack pack

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3676.8s	3676.8	 And somehow hugo chavez was behind this even though he's been dead for seven years hugo got us again

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3688.8s	3688.8	 Anyway, it was so wild and crazy that basically the narrative just cracked and so then you had like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3696.6s	3696.6	 Steve schwarzman come out and then sort of the republican business community and and pat toomy, you know republican senator from pennsylvania came out

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3850.1s	3850.1	 Because we never got credit for the vaccine now if

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3858.7s	3858.7	 I think you got to say that if these vaccines end covet in the next three four or five months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=3864.4s	3864.4	 2021 is going to be a great year

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4213.5s	4213.5	 Tired ways of behavior from my teens and my 20s that were just unproductive and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4219.9s	4219.9	 In the day-to-day life of just running around and going to meetings as david said like flying around go to a meeting go to the office

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4232.6s	4232.6	 Um, and so what i'm really thankful for is in this lockdown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4236.8s	4236.8	 I've been forced to really find the things that uh that I don't really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4241.3s	4241.3	 Like about myself and try to fix them

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4252.3s	4252.3	 That's definitely one thing for me. It's very touching and actually quite appropriate as we wrap here because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4258.3s	4258.3	 Sax and freebrook and I had some things we don't like about you chamath that we wanted to bring up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4264.1s	4264.1	 You kind of knocked one off the list already so we've got four more to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4267.8s	4267.8	 Uh, it's it's good. You're doing this work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4271.2s	4271.2	 It's good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4272.8s	4272.8	 We were planning an intervention for this end of the pod, but you kind of open the door. So here we go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4279.5s	4279.5	 You know i'll wrap up with just saying, you know family and friends are the obvious, you know things that you appreciate at this time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4286.9s	4286.9	 I am thankful also for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4289.3s	4289.3	 the hope that we've seen from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4292.1s	4292.1	 Uh, you know what we can do collectively as a society
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4296.0s	4296.0	 When we put our minds to something warp speed comes to mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4299.2s	4299.2	 These frontline workers. I mean we we really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4303.0s	4303.0	 Maybe have seen what a global
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4305.7s	4305.7	 Uh record a challenging problem being solved can do and hopefully that can translate into something like nuclear disarmament
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4312.5s	4312.5	 Sustainable energy global warming, etc. And so I think on a on a macro level the most macro levels the species
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4320.1s	4320.1	 Us humans as a species have now had an enlightening moment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4323.2s	4323.2	 Just like world wars, uh, and you know, hiroshima and nagasaki kind of changed people's perspective of the entire world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4329.6s	4329.6	 Jay and I were talking about that the other day how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4332.3s	4332.3	 People looked at the world differently after those horrific bombs went off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4336.3s	4336.3	 I think after this bomb goes off, we're going to look at the world and say hey we can solve problems, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4339.9s	4339.9	 And maybe we can be proactive about that. And then finally I think for the people suffering from mental illness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4345.6s	4345.6	 Who maybe I was callous and made fun of uh, or maybe just didn't relate to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4350.8s	4350.8	 I can relate to now because I have felt depressed. I have felt anxious. I have felt exhausted from this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4356.1s	4356.1	 Right, and it's the first time in the 49 years i've been on the planet that I ever would say I felt depressed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4360.9s	4360.9	 I didn't understand what that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4362.9s	4362.9	 Meaning was when sax would tell me how depressed he was. I just never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4366.9s	4366.9	 Never hit me. I'm joking. He never said that but uh, it's a good joke. I am joking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4371.4s	4371.4	 But I I you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4372.8s	4372.8	 I think for people suffering from mental illness get help and you know talk to people and and I think this really opened my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4378.4s	4378.4	 My eyes to that and of course
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4380.4s	4380.4	 This podcast, uh, you know and our podcast was the best thing that that in one of the best things in my life that came out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4386.6s	4386.6	 Of this whole period I think for me too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4389.2s	4389.2	 um, and you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4390.1s	4390.1	 I've heard that from a lot of the people who listen to it and i'm sure if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4393.5s	4393.5	 sax and friedberg had a fourth emotion they would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4396.4s	4396.4	 They would agree frankly. I think this podcast has been doing nothing but costing me money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4402.1s	4402.1	 You know because I painted you as a trump supporter god knows how many years i've lost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4406.9s	4406.9	 Because jason keeps trolling me as a trump supporter and then on top of it I get cut out of the only good bestie deal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4417.1s	4417.1	 If you would I thought at least I would get this bestie deal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4421.4s	4421.4	 And you guys cut me out of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4423.4s	4423.4	 Uh, okay. Listen, I just want to be clear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4426.5s	4426.5	 Sax is a conservative and a republican. He is not a trump supporter. He did not vote for trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4431.6s	4431.6	 This time he did not vote for trump last time. He does not support trump's behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4435.7s	4435.7	 You can't out what he's voting dude
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4437.8s	4437.8	 Sorry, but he told me he didn't vote for him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4440.1s	4440.1	 Well, he did which one which one of us which one of us is going to try to hire jared kushner as a general partner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4447.4s	4447.4	 Uh, no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4448.7s	4448.7	 Definitely not if you are saying most likely because now you're reinforcing the theme that's actually if you had to pick actually if you had to pick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4454.5s	4454.5	 A venture fund that is most like the higher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4456.8s	4456.8	 Uh jerry kushner as a gp and rason harvitz they'll do anything for are they still around founders fund?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4463.0s	4463.0	 Um, no, I don't think peter wants to share the spotlight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4467.0s	4467.0	 Okay, um, I go in drason. They'll do anything to get a press release
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4472.1s	4472.1	 I don't think that guy needs a fund to go work at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4474.9s	4474.9	 True, he'll just go buy another. You know, he did get three middle east peace deals done. So but you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4484.9s	4484.9	 By the way, by the way, I mean talk talking about inheriting incredible dividends, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4490.1s	4490.1	 Is it the most incredible thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4492.2s	4492.2	 that um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4493.5s	4493.5	 You can come in and get middle east peace done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4495.4s	4495.4	 But if you really unpack middle east peace, do you think that middle east peace would have happened?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4499.5s	4499.5	 If the cost of solar was not cheaper than the cost of oil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4503.0s	4503.0	 honestly, be like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4505.0s	4505.0	 If if you if you didn't see an end in sight to oil, do you think that the middle east peace?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4509.6s	4509.6	 Yeah, I know what you're saying. I don't think so. Well, I I know what you're saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4513.2s	4513.2	 Which is that if the middle east wasn't becoming less strategically relevant to us, you know that that creates degrees of freedom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4519.7s	4519.7	 I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4521.1s	4521.1	 But um, yeah, that's had profound benefits for silicon valley too, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4525.4s	4525.4	 like I mean all the stuff they went into the vision fund
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4528.6s	4528.6	 And the the money from catar and the money from like all these sovereign wealth funds in the middle east has funded a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4534.6s	4534.6	 Venture funds has gone into direct late stage rounds in a lot of companies and it's really been a great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4539.4s	4539.4	 Boom for silicon valley people can make fun of the company's getting overfunded and the nonsense. It's gone on all they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4544.8s	4544.8	 Like money coming in it filters out into more angel investing it filters out into more venture lps and it ultimately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4552.6s	4552.6	 Gives a big boost to this ecosystem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4554.2s	4554.2	 So I I think that the damage to oil has been great for silicon valley the most incredible dividend of climate change is peace
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4561.8s	4561.8	 It's like it's it it is made radical islam
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4565.9s	4565.9	 A failed startup, you know a hyped series a that couldn't raise its series b
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4570.6s	4570.6	 It's made, you know sworn enemies over thousands of years cooperate together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4575.5s	4575.5	 um all for what reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4577.2s	4577.2	 Because you gotta pull the oil out of the ground now and monetize it because otherwise the cost of wind and you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4583.6s	4583.6	 Solar, yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4584.5s	4584.5	 And you have to diversify because otherwise the cost of wind and the cost of solar is going to make pulling the oil out of the ground
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4589.4s	4589.4	 Economically infeasible within three or four years. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4594.6s	4594.6	 They took sadyr amco public they started selling off the shares and they invested that capital in tech and other stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4600.2s	4600.2	 around the world and that's it's been helpful, but there is there is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4603.9s	4603.9	 Another factor at work, which is the fear of iran
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4608.5s	4608.5	 Is now greater than on the part of saudi arabia and israel that their fear of iran is is now greater than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4615.7s	4615.7	 Whatever mutual hostility they used to have and so it's it's kind of bringing people together that way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4621.6s	4621.6	 But you got to give christian credit for still getting those deals done. You know, no one thought he could do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4625.5s	4625.5	 I remember everyone was mocking him. I agree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OELRmfqrr2k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=130&t=4627.8s	4627.8	 He's not he's not he's not a moron and he's not um, and he's not he's the opposite of an abrasive guy
