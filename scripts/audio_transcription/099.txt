https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=0.0s	0.0	 We're seven minutes in and we've produced absolutely nothing that will go in the show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4.4s	4.4	 Here comes Sax waking up with his commentary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=8.0s	8.0	 When Freeberg is criticizing you for being too negative, you're in a dark place, Sax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=12.3s	12.3	 I'm actually angry at Sax for not publishing my AMA from the other night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=15.4s	15.4	 It's coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=16.2s	16.2	 While he publishes an evolved content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=17.4s	17.4	 His app crashed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=18.8s	18.8	 We had such a crowded room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=20.3s	20.3	 We had over 2,000 people in the room for like four hours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=23.8s	23.8	 It was crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=24.5s	24.5	 It was like the original days of Clubhouse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=26.6s	26.6	 Everyone I know that was trying to get in was texting saying they couldn't get in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=29.1s	29.1	 So it definitely capped out, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=30.9s	30.9	 I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=31.4s	31.4	 Well, we hit some scalability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=33.2s	33.2	 You may want to buy an extra server, Sax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=35.4s	35.4	 Cheap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=36.2s	36.2	 Weren't you the same guy who was responsible for scaring PayPal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=38.8s	38.8	 No, that was somebody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=39.9s	39.9	 That was eBay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=41.3s	41.3	 They sold it before it scaled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=42.9s	42.9	 No, that's not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=43.8s	43.8	 We had huge scalability challenges at PayPal too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=46.9s	46.9	 It seems like a theme.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=48.2s	48.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=48.5s	48.5	 The theme is when you have an app that's breaking out, you hit scalability challenges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=52.3s	52.3	 It's called a high class problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=53.9s	53.9	 2,000 people is not a high class problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=56.6s	56.6	 It's a trickle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=57.6s	57.6	 It's 2022.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=59.4s	59.4	 2,000 people participating in the conversation is a challenge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=62.6s	62.6	 I haven't written code in 20 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=64.5s	64.5	 Here's what you do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=65.4s	65.4	 When you get to 1,000 people coming to the room, everybody else is in passive mode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=69.1s	69.1	 You've never written code ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=70.5s	70.5	 Of course I have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=71.3s	71.3	 Of course I have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=72.0s	72.0	 That's a lie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=72.5s	72.5	 Come on, be honest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=73.4s	73.4	 Oh yeah, it's actually been 25.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=74.9s	74.9	 The last time I wrote code was Lotus Notes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=89.1s	89.1	 And they've just gone crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=94.7s	94.7	 So there have been three cheating scandals across poker chess and even competitive fishing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=100.3s	100.3	 I don't know if you guys saw the fishing one, but they found weights and filets during a fish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=105.2s	105.2	 weigh in and then everybody wants us to check in on the chess and the poker scandals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=110.3s	110.3	 Chess.com just released their report that this grand master has been suspended.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=116.5s	116.5	 They have evidence he cheated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=117.7s	117.7	 Basically in a bunch of tournaments that were in fact for money, he denied that he had done that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=125.0s	125.0	 But he had previously cheated as a kid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=126.6s	126.6	 They now have the statistical proof that he was playing essentially perfect chess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=132.6s	132.6	 And they have outlined this in like hundreds of pages in a report.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=136.7s	136.7	 Sax, what are your thoughts on this scandal in chess?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=139.8s	139.8	 Magnus Carlsen finally came out and explained why he thought Hans Nieman was cheating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=144.8s	144.8	 Hans Nieman was cheating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=146.0s	146.0	 Basically he got the strong perception during the game that Hans wasn't really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=150.2s	150.2	 putting in a lot of effort, that he wasn't under a lot of stress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=153.0s	153.0	 And it's his experience that when he's playing the top players, they're intensely concentrating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=159.5s	159.5	 And Hans Nieman didn't seem to be exerting himself at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=162.4s	162.4	 So his hackles were raised and got suspicious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=165.8s	165.8	 And then he has had this meteoric rise, the fastest rise in classical chess rating ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=172.5s	172.5	 And I guess he had gotten suspended from chess.com in the past for cheating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=177.7s	177.7	 So on this basis and maybe other things that Magnus isn't telling us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=180.6s	180.6	 Magnus basically said that this guy is cheating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=183.0s	183.0	 I think that maybe the interesting part of this is that there's been a lot of analysis now of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=186.6s	186.6	 Hans Nieman's games.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=187.8s	187.8	 And I just think the methodology is kind of interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=190.6s	190.6	 So what they do is they run all of his games through a computer and they compare his moves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=197.0s	197.0	 to the best computer move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=199.1s	199.1	 And they basically assign a percentage that Hans matches, a correlation matches the computer move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=205.5s	205.5	 And what they found is there were a handful of games where it was literally 100%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=209.2s	209.2	 That's basically impossible without cheating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=211.3s	211.3	 I mean, you look at the top players who through an entire career have never had 100% game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=217.3s	217.3	 Chess is so subtle that the computer can now see so many moves into the future that nailing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=222.6s	222.6	 the best move every single time for 40, 50, 100 moves is just-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=225.7s	225.7	 And in chess, which a human really can't do that well is that there are positional sacrifices
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=232.2s	232.2	 that you will make in short lines that pay off much, much later in the future,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=236.1s	236.1	 which is impossible for a human to calculate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=238.1s	238.1	 And so, and you saw this by the way, when I think it was the Google AI, the DeepMind AI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=244.9s	244.9	 that also played chess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=246.0s	246.0	 So the idea that this guy could play absolutely perfectly according to those lines is only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=252.6s	252.6	 possible if you're cheating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=253.9s	253.9	 Right, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=254.8s	254.8	 So there were a handful of games at 100% and then there were tournaments where his percentages
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=259.2s	259.2	 were in the 70 something plus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=261.8s	261.8	 And so just to give you some base for comparison, Bobby Fischer during his legendary 20 game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=266.7s	266.7	 winning streak was at 72%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=269.6s	269.6	 So he only matched the computer for best move 72% of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=273.8s	273.8	 Magnus Carlsen playing at his best is 70%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=278.2s	278.2	 Gary Kasparov in his career was 69%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=281.4s	281.4	 And then the super GMs category are typically in the 64 to 68% range.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=287.9s	287.9	 So I think it's really interesting actually how you can now quantify by comparing the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=292.5s	292.5	 human move to the best computer move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=294.6s	294.6	 And it's multiple computers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=295.7s	295.7	 Who's playing the best.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=296.8s	296.8	 They actually have-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=298.1s	298.1	 It provides a way to assess who the greatest player ever is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=300.9s	300.9	 I actually thought that it was Magnus, but now maybe there's a basis for believing it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=304.9s	304.9	 was Bobby Fischer because he was at 72 and Magnus was only at 70.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=308.3s	308.3	 However, look, the idea that Hans Niemann is in the 70s, 80s or 90s during tournaments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=313.9s	313.9	 would be just an off the charts level of play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=317.3s	317.3	 And if he's not cheating, then we should expect over the next couple of years that he should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=324.5s	324.5	 rapidly become the world's number one player over the board now that they have all this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=329.8s	329.8	 anti-cheating stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=330.6s	330.6	 Right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=331.0s	331.0	 So it'll be interesting to see what happens in his career now that they've really cracked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=335.4s	335.4	 down on, you know, on with anti-cheating technology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=339.6s	339.6	 I have a general observation, which is these people are complete fucking losers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=345.4s	345.4	 The people that cheat in any of these games don't understand this basic simple idea,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=351.0s	351.0	 which is that trying is a huge part of the human experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=354.6s	354.6	 The whole point is to be out there in the field of play trying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=358.8s	358.8	 And it's basically taking the wins and the losses and getting better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=362.2s	362.2	 That is the path.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=363.4s	363.4	 That's what's fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=365.0s	365.0	 Once you actually win, it's actually not that much fun because then you have this pressure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=369.5s	369.5	 of maintaining excellence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=370.9s	370.9	 That's a lot less enjoyable than the path to getting there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=374.6s	374.6	 And so the fact that these people don't understand that makes them slightly broken,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=379.5s	379.5	 in my opinion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=380.9s	380.9	 And then the other thing is like, why is it that we have the strain of people now that are just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=385.8s	385.8	 so devoid of any personal responsibility that they'll just so brazenly take advantage of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=391.4s	391.4	 stuff?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=391.6s	391.6	 It's really ridiculous to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=393.8s	393.8	 It's really sad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=394.6s	394.6	 These people are pathetic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=395.4s	395.4	 They're losers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=395.9s	395.9	 It's really pathetic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=397.6s	397.6	 It is really interesting how they caught him and running this against the computer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=401.0s	401.0	 Here's a chart of his scores in these tournaments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=405.2s	405.2	 Oh, here is this first chart is how quickly he advanced, which was off the charts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=410.6s	410.6	 And then the second chart that's really interesting is his chess.com strength.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=415.0s	415.0	 So if you don't know chess.com, it has become like a juggernaut in the chess world,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=417.8s	417.8	 especially after that HBO series came out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=421.6s	421.6	 A lot of people subscribe to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=422.7s	422.7	 I subscribe to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=423.3s	423.3	 I like to play chess there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=425.2s	425.2	 And man, you look at the chess strength score there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=428.0s	428.0	 He was just like perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=429.1s	429.1	 And then the number of games he likely cheated in, you can see the last two columns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=432.6s	432.6	 He's basically cheating in every game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=435.1s	435.1	 Queen's Gambit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=435.8s	435.8	 Yeah, great show on Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=439.1s	439.1	 And he said he didn't cheat in any of the games where they were live streaming,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=445.4s	445.4	 but they've proven that wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=446.9s	446.9	 Sax, how does he cheat in person then?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=449.0s	449.0	 Well, that's the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=449.6s	449.6	 No one really knows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=451.4s	451.4	 I don't want to overly judge until they have hard proof that he was cheating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=455.8s	455.8	 I mean, look, here's the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=456.6s	456.6	 He was never caught in the act.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=458.1s	458.1	 It's just that the computer evidence seems pretty damning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=462.9s	462.9	 And I don't know how they prove that he was cheating over the board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=468.1s	468.1	 without actually catching him doing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=469.6s	469.6	 And I still don't think anyone really has a good theory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=472.6s	472.6	 in terms of how he was able to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=474.5s	474.5	 Well, it's not just him though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=475.7s	475.7	 Look, the fishing thing, Jason, which was crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=478.4s	478.4	 I think Freebird shared the video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=480.1s	480.1	 This guy was in a fishing competition and they basically caught these fish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=483.2s	483.2	 and then they put these big weighted pellets inside the fish's body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=487.2s	487.2	 They even put like a chicken breast and chicken fillets inside of the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=491.4s	491.4	 So that they would win more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=492.6s	492.6	 Yeah, they put fish fillets in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=494.6s	494.6	 You know, then there's in poker now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=498.2s	498.2	 In poker, everybody's afraid that there are ways in which you can read the RFID
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=502.6s	502.6	 and some of the cards and some of these televised situations and front run
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=507.3s	507.3	 what the playing situation is so that you know whether you're winning or losing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=510.7s	510.7	 And again, I just asked the question, like, is it is this are things that bad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=515.8s	515.8	 that this is what it gets to?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=517.0s	517.0	 Like we all play poker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=518.6s	518.6	 The idea that we would play against somebody that would take that edge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=523.0s	523.0	 That's gross.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=523.7s	523.7	 Yeah, it's really makes me really sad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=526.7s	526.7	 So disappointing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=527.8s	527.8	 Yeah, it's horrible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=529.3s	529.3	 One observation might be that across all three,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=532.3s	532.3	 because I'm trying to find some common thread across these,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=534.6s	534.6	 but it could be that there was a lot of cheating going on for a long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=539.3s	539.3	 And maybe the fact that we do have so much digital imagery that's live on these things now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=547.2s	547.2	 and so much coverage and everyone's got a cell phone that suddenly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=551.5s	551.5	 our perception of the cheating in competitive events is becoming more tuned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=558.2s	558.2	 Whereas maybe there's been a lot of cheating for a long time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=561.5s	561.5	 and it's just kind of coming to light.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=563.4s	563.4	 We didn't have a lot of live streaming in poker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=566.6s	566.6	 Who knows?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=567.4s	567.4	 We could probably ask Phil this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=569.0s	569.0	 We're kidding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=569.5s	569.5	 But for how many years was there was this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=571.6s	571.6	 There was tons of cheating in online poker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=576.8s	576.8	 Remember, people are using these software programs that would track the hand history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=585.3s	585.3	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=587.0s	587.0	 So it help you assess whether the person might be bluffing that particular situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=590.6s	590.6	 Like he has superhuman memory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=593.5s	593.5	 I don't know if you guys watch Twitch, like video games, like Fortnite or whatever,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=596.5s	596.5	 but there are players that have been accused of using these screen overlay systems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=602.3s	602.3	 that basically more accurately show you and drive the mouse to where an individual is on the screen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=607.0s	607.0	 so you can more accurately shoot them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=609.0s	609.0	 And so there's software overlays that make you a better competitive video game player.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=614.2s	614.2	 Can I tell you what the through line is?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=616.3s	616.3	 And then the stuff basically became like...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=619.4s	619.4	 Now what's interesting is now there's eye tracking software
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=622.8s	622.8	 that people are using on Twitch streams to see if the individual
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=627.3s	627.3	 is actually spotting the target when they shoot or if the software is spotting the target.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=632.3s	632.3	 Aim bots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=633.4s	633.4	 They're aim bots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=634.4s	634.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=634.6s	634.6	 They're like reverse cheat the whole thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=636.2s	636.2	 And I think what's interesting is just that there's so much insight now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=639.2s	639.2	 so much more video streams, so much more...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=642.2s	642.2	 I mean, think about all those guys at that fishing competition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=644.8s	644.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=645.0s	645.0	 And there's cell phones and they all video this thing happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=648.2s	648.2	 10 years ago, that wouldn't have been the case and there wouldn't have been a big story about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=651.5s	651.5	 And so...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=652.0s	652.0	 Shamath, you said there was a theme you wanted to...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=655.0s	655.0	 I think the theme is pretty obvious, which is that there's been an absolute decay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=660.2s	660.2	 of personal responsibility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=662.2s	662.2	 People don't feel like there's any downside to cheating anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=667.1s	667.1	 And they're not willing to take it upon themselves to take a journey of wins and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=670.7s	670.7	 losses to get better at something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=672.4s	672.4	 They want the easy solution, the easy solve, the quick answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=678.2s	678.2	 That gets them to some sort of finish line that they've imagined for themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=682.5s	682.5	 will solve all their problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=684.3s	684.3	 The problem is it doesn't solve any problems and it just makes them a wholly corrupt individual.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=689.6s	689.6	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=690.2s	690.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=690.4s	690.4	 So let's talk about this Hustler Casino Live cash game play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=694.7s	694.7	 There's this woman, Robbie, who is a new player.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=698.1s	698.1	 Apparently she's being staked in a very high stakes game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=700.6s	700.6	 She's playing as a guy, Garrett, who is a very, very known winning cash game player.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=708.2s	708.2	 And it was a very strange hand on the turn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=711.3s	711.3	 All the money gets in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=712.3s	712.3	 She says she has a bluff catcher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=713.7s	713.7	 Then she claims that she had thought she misread her hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=717.0s	717.0	 Now people are saying that the poker world seems to be 70-30 that she cheated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=722.2s	722.2	 but people keep vacillating back and forth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=726.1s	726.1	 There was a lot of weird words, salad, that she said that she had a bluff catcher,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=730.2s	730.2	 which would normally be an ace.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=732.0s	732.0	 Then she said she thought she had a pair of threes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=734.1s	734.1	 And then she immediately said afterwards that he was giving her too much credit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=738.5s	738.5	 They confronted her in the hallway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=739.8s	739.8	 She gave the money back because she supposedly loves production.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=742.9s	742.9	 So all of this stuff sounds very weird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=745.0s	745.0	 One side says, okay, well, this is happening because she's a new player.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=748.3s	748.3	 The other side is saying somebody was signaling her that she was good and giving her just a binary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=754.3s	754.3	 You're good because if you were going to cheat cheating with Jack high in a situation where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=758.4s	758.4	 you just put all in for a quarter million dollar pot seems very suspect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=763.4s	763.4	 I don't know if you guys watch the hand breakdown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=766.0s	766.0	 Where does everybody stand on a percentage basis, I guess,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=769.0s	769.0	 of if they think she was cheating or not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=771.0s	771.0	 Because this is not definitive, obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=773.2s	773.2	 It's not like they cut it open and found the ball bearings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=775.3s	775.3	 It's not so obvious in that situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=777.7s	777.7	 But I think the way that that line played made no sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=781.1s	781.1	 It did not make any sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=782.7s	782.7	 She was holding a Jack four and I guess in her previous hand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=786.7s	786.7	 she had a Jack three and there was a three on the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=790.2s	790.2	 So if she misread her hand for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=791.6s	791.6	 The board was 10, 10, 9, 3.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=793.1s	793.1	 No, but you would have had to call the flop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=796.2s	796.2	 I'm thinking what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=797.8s	797.8	 Yeah, no, I get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=798.9s	798.9	 The hand makes no sense, but I'm just trying to find a logical explanation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=802.3s	802.3	 And that Jack three explanation, somebody kind of fed that to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=806.6s	806.6	 And then she changed her story to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=808.2s	808.2	 So this changing of the story is the thing I was sort of keyed on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=811.4s	811.4	 Friedberg is why does she keep changing her story?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=813.3s	813.3	 Is it because she's embarrassed?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=814.7s	814.7	 Maybe she's had a couple of beverages or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=817.7s	817.7	 Or she's just a new player and she's embarrassed by her play and can't explain it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=822.3s	822.3	 She can't explain the hand history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=823.9s	823.9	 All of the things you're saying are probable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=826.6s	826.6	 I don't think that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=827.6s	827.6	 Yeah, I don't think there's any data for us to have a strongly held point of view on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=831.8s	831.8	 I'm just looking forward to us all playing live.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=835.1s	835.1	 Yeah, HCL poker live October 21st minus David Sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=838.7s	838.7	 Unfortunately, to mop J Cal Gerstner, Stanley Tang, Phil Hellmuth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=843.9s	843.9	 We're going to be playing on the same stream.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=845.9s	845.9	 We're going to be playing on the same stream, same table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=848.1s	848.1	 I figured out how to hack into the video stream for the car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=850.6s	850.6	 I just got my RFID sunglasses as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=853.4s	853.4	 I'm going to read all your shitty hands, J Cal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=855.5s	855.5	 I'm going to take your money and I'm going to buy my kids some nice books.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=859.5s	859.5	 For my 40th birthday, Sky organized poker in Tahoe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=862.6s	862.6	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=863.4s	863.4	 And we brought in the team from CBS.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=866.0s	866.0	 That was the present where they taped it as if it was being broadcast with whole cards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=871.2s	871.2	 and commentators and we edited it into a two day show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=874.5s	874.5	 It was an incredible birthday present.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=877.2s	877.2	 It's one of the greatest things that anybody's ever given me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=879.9s	879.9	 I appreciate it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=881.3s	881.3	 There was a one hour block where somebody at the table said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=885.5s	885.5	 okay, guys, how about we do a cheating free for all?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=888.4s	888.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=888.9s	888.9	 Where you could look at each other's cards and you could sort of help somebody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=893.8s	893.8	 Switch cards, whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=895.2s	895.2	 In that one hour, our beautiful home game of friendship became Lord of the Flies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=901.0s	901.0	 I have never seen so much hatred, angling, mean behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=907.6s	907.6	 Oh my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=908.2s	908.2	 It was incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=910.3s	910.3	 All that humans are capable of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=911.6s	911.6	 So I hope that we never see cheating in our game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=916.2s	916.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=916.4s	916.4	 Well, we'll see how it goes on October 21st at HCL Poker Live.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=920.4s	920.4	 I'm excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=921.0s	921.0	 I can't wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=921.7s	921.7	 It should be a lot of fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=922.6s	922.6	 It should be a lot of fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=923.5s	923.5	 And we're not having any official 100 stuff, but the fans, some of the fans who were at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=929.1s	929.1	 the All In Summit 2022 are doing their own episode 100 meetups on October 15th, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=940.2s	940.2	 AllInMeetups.io.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=942.0s	942.0	 So there are fan meetups happening in Zurich and a bunch of other places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=945.1s	945.1	 I'm going to FaceTime into some of them and just say hi to the fans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=947.6s	947.6	 It might be like 10 people in a bar somewhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=950.2s	950.2	 I think the largest one is like Miami or San Francisco.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=953.0s	953.0	 Are going to be like 50 people or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=954.4s	954.4	 We should all FaceTime it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=955.6s	955.6	 That'd actually be kind of fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=957.0s	957.0	 I'm basically, I told them to send me an invite and I'll FaceTime in any time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=961.8s	961.8	 This is next week?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=962.7s	962.7	 When is this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=963.4s	963.4	 The 15th, I think, is occurring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=966.1s	966.1	 Yeah, October 15th.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=967.4s	967.4	 It's a Saturday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=968.2s	968.2	 The Saturday after the 100th episode, people are doing these AllInMeetups.io.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=972.2s	972.2	 What's next?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=972.9s	972.9	 Earlier this week, it was reported that Elon contacted Twitter's board and suggested that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=979.2s	979.2	 they move forward with closing the transaction at the original terms and the original purchase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=983.3s	983.3	 price of $54.20 a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=986.0s	986.0	 In the couple of days since then, and even as of right now with some news reports coming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=990.6s	990.6	 out here on Thursday morning, it appears that there are still some question marks around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=995.9s	995.9	 whether or not the deal is actually going to move forward at $54.20 a share because Elon,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1000.6s	1000.6	 as of right now, the report said is still asking for a financing contingency in order to close.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1006.1s	1006.1	 And there's a lot of back and forth on what the terms are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1008.5s	1008.5	 Meanwhile, the court case in Delaware is continuing forward on whether or not Elon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1014.0s	1014.0	 breached his terms of the original agreement to close and buy Twitter at $54.20.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1019.0s	1019.0	 As we know, leading up to the signed deal or post-signing the deal, Elon put together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1025.6s	1025.6	 a financing syndicate, a combination of debt investors as well as equity co-investors with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1030.7s	1030.7	 him to do the purchase of Twitter at $54.20 a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1035.4s	1035.4	 So the $40-some-odd billion of capital that's needed was committed by a set of investors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1041.1s	1041.1	 that were going to invest debt and equity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1043.0s	1043.0	 And there's a big question mark now on whether or not those investors want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1047.1s	1047.1	 or would still consummate the transaction with Elon given how the markets have turned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1051.5s	1051.5	 and given how debt markets are trading and equity markets are trading.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1054.4s	1054.4	 So Chamath, I'd love to hear your point of view on what hurdles does Elon still have in front of him?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1060.6s	1060.6	 Does he still want to get this done?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1061.8s	1061.8	 And is there still a financing syndicate that's standing behind him at the original purchase price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1066.2s	1066.2	 to get it done?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1067.8s	1067.8	 It's a great question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1069.3s	1069.3	 Maybe the best way to start is, Nick, do you want to cue up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1072.0s	1072.0	 what I said in August 25th?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1074.6s	1074.6	 The lawsuit really boils down to one very specific clause, which is the pinnacle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1080.2s	1080.2	 question at hand, which is there is a specific performance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1085.5s	1085.5	 clause that Elon signed up to, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1089.4s	1089.4	 Which, you know, his lawyers could have struck out and either chose not to or,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1094.2s	1094.2	 you know, couldn't get the deal done without.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1096.5s	1096.5	 And that specific performance clause says that Twitter can force him to close at 5420 a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1104.2s	1104.2	 And I think the issue at hand at the Delaware Business Court is going to be that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1109.1s	1109.1	 because Twitter is going to point to all of these, you know, gotchas and disclaimers that they have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1114.6s	1114.6	 around this bought issue as their cover story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1120.2s	1120.2	 And I think that really, you know, this kind of again builds more and more momentum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1125.7s	1125.7	 in my mind that the most likely outcome here is a settlement where you have to pay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1133.4s	1133.4	 the economic difference between where the stock is now and 5420, which is more than a billion dollars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1140.5s	1140.5	 or you close at some number below $54.20 a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1146.3s	1146.3	 And I think that that is like, you know, if you had to be a betting person, that's probably,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1150.2s	1150.2	 and if you look at the way the stock is traded, and if you also look at the way the options
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1155.4s	1155.4	 market trades, that's what people are assuming that there's a seven to $10 billion swing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1161.2s	1161.2	 And if you impute that into the stock price, you kind of get into the $51 a share kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1166.5s	1166.5	 an acquisition price. Again, I'm not saying that that is right or should be right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1170.4s	1170.4	 That's just sort of what the market says.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1172.4s	1172.4	 Yeah, so it turns out that, you know, sort of like that kind of guesstimate turned out to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1177.8s	1177.8	 pretty accurate because the stock today is at $51 a share. So I think that the specific performance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1183.7s	1183.7	 thing is exactly what this thing has always hinged on. And I think that there is a realization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1189.0s	1189.0	 that there are very few outs around how that contractual term was written and agreed to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1194.6s	1194.6	 So there is an out in the contract. And that out says that I think it's by April,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1200.1s	1200.1	 if if the deal doesn't get done by April, then the banks can walk away from their commitment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1206.2s	1206.2	 to fund the debt. And if the banks walk away, then Elon does have a financing contingency that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1211.8s	1211.8	 allows him to walk away. So the actual set of events that have to happen is those two things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1217.2s	1217.2	 specifically get to April, so the banks can pass and say, we've changed our mind market conditions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1222.7s	1222.7	 are different. And then Elon is able to say, Oh, you know, the banks just walked away. Right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1227.7s	1227.7	 the banks, if you look at all of the debt that they've committed to, what they committed at a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1233.2s	1233.2	 point in time when the debt markets were much better than they are today, in the last, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1239.2s	1239.2	 six or seven months since they agreed to do this, the debt markets have been clobbered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1243.8s	1243.8	 And specifically, junk bonds and a bunch of junk bond debt, the yields that you have to pay, so the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1249.0s	1249.0	 price to get that kind of debt has skyrocketed. So roughly back of the envelope math would tell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1255.4s	1255.4	 me that right now the banks are offside between one and $2 billion, because they're not going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1260.2s	1260.2	 be able to sell this debt to anybody else. So I think the banks obviously want to weigh out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1264.9s	1264.9	 The problem is their only way out is to run the shot clock off until April. So I think that's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1270.2s	1270.2	 dance that they're in right now. Elon's trying to find a way to solve, you know, for the merger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1276.1s	1276.1	 I think Twitter is going to say, we're not going to give you a financing contingency, you have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1279.7s	1279.7	 bring the banks in and close right now. And then we will not go to court. Otherwise, we're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1285.0s	1285.0	 court. And so I think it's a very delicate predicament that they're all in. But my estimate is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1290.9s	1290.9	 that the equity is probably 20% offside. So it's not a huge thing. He can make that up because he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1297.0s	1297.0	 can create equity value like nobody's business. The debt is way offside by a couple billion dollars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1303.0s	1303.0	 which is hard to make back. But I think in the end, you know, given enough time, they can probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1307.7s	1307.7	 make that back. The best off in all of this are the Twitter shareholders. They're getting an enormous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1313.4s	1313.4	 premium to what that company is worth today in the open market. And so I think this deal is going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1318.8s	1318.8	 close as probably going to close in the next few weeks. And had you bought Twitter when we were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1323.7s	1323.7	 talking about it in August, you would have made 25% in six weeks. And you know, if the deal closes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1328.6s	1328.6	 at 54, you would have made a third of your money in eight weeks, which is, you know, very hard to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1333.4s	1333.4	 do in a market. If you're a GP at one of the funds, like Andreessen or Sequoia, and you had made this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1340.3s	1340.3	 commitment to Elon, or even Larry Ellison, a couple months ago, do you fight against closing at 5420?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1348.3s	1348.3	 Do you stick with the deal and support him? I mean, what do you do given that the premium is so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1353.4s	1353.4	 much higher than where the market would trade it at today? Some people are saying the stock should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1356.6s	1356.6	 be at like 20 bucks a share or something. The average premium in an M&A transaction in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1360.3s	1360.3	 public markets is about 30%. So and I think the fair value of Twitter is around 32 to 35 bucks a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1369.0s	1369.0	 share. So you know, it's not like he is massively massively overpaying. And so you know, I would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1376.1s	1376.1	 just sort of keep that in the realm of the possible. So like, if you take $35 as the midpoint,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1383.0s	1383.0	 fair value is really 4550. So yeah, he paid 20% more than he should have, but he didn't pay 100%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1388.4s	1388.4	 more. So it's not as if you can't make that equity back as a private company, particularly because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1394.9s	1394.9	 there's probably $10 of fat in the stock. If you think about just OPEX, right, in terms of all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1400.2s	1400.2	 buildings they have, maybe they don't need as many employees, maybe they revisit salaries, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1405.3s	1405.3	 one thing is when I looked at doing an activist play at Twitter, I think I mentioned this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1409.7s	1409.7	 five or six years ago, one of the things that I found was at that time, Twitter was running
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1414.0s	1414.0	 their own data centers. And you know, the most obvious thing for me at that time was like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1417.8s	1417.8	 we're going to move everything to AWS. Now, I don't know if that happened. But I'm sure that if it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1422.6s	1422.6	 hasn't, just bidding that out to Azure, GCP, and AWS can raise, you know, three or $4 billion,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1428.7s	1428.7	 because I'm sure those companies would want this kind of an app on their cloud. So there's all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1434.2s	1434.2	 kinds of things that I think Elon can do as a private company to make back maybe the small bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1439.0s	1439.0	 that he overpaid. And then he can get to the core job of rebuilding this company to be usable,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1444.1s	1444.1	 this product to be usable. Because I look, I'll just speak as a user right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1448.2s	1448.2	 It has been decaying at a very, very rapid clip. And I think that his trepidation and closing the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1454.6s	1454.6	 merger, in part also, even though he hasn't said it has to do with the quality of the experience,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1460.4s	1460.4	 it's just degraded, it's not as fun to use as it was during the pandemic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1466.5s	1466.5	 or even before the pandemic. So something is happening inside that app that needs to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1471.4s	1471.4	 fixed. And if he does it, he'll make a ton of money. Sort of like what happened with Friendster
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1475.4s	1475.4	 and MySpace and any social networking app over time, the quality degrades, if it's not growing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1480.5s	1480.5	 it's shrinking, and it gets if it's if it's not growing. And also, if the product hygiene
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1485.9s	1485.9	 isn't enforced in code and product hygiene, in this case, are this, you know, spam bots,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1492.3s	1492.3	 you know, the trolling, it can really take away from the experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1496.8s	1496.8	 Yeah. I mean, interestingly, like, if you think back to the original, the starting days,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1501.3s	1501.3	 the original days of Twitter, I don't know if you guys remember, you would send in an SMS to do your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1505.8s	1505.8	 tweet. And then it would post up and other people would get the SMS notification. And it would crash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1513.0s	1513.0	 all the time. And the apps were the app was notoriously crashing. It was poorly architected
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1518.2s	1518.2	 at the beginning. And some people have argued that Twitter has had a cultural technical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1524.0s	1524.0	 incompetence from the earliest days. I think that's a little harsh. So I do think look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1528.2s	1528.2	 Twitter was known for what's called a fail whale. You know, they used to have these fail whales
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1532.1s	1532.1	 constantly. And they did hire people that attempted to try to fix it. I remember the,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1538.6s	1538.6	 the funniest part of when I went in there and said, Hey, here's my plan. And here's what I want to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1542.9s	1542.9	 Is literally a day or two later, the head of engineering quit, I can't remember who his name
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1547.3s	1547.3	 was, but he was just out the door. But it is a I think it is a team that has tried its best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1557.8s	1557.8	 that probably at the edges, definitely made some technical miscalculations. Like I said, at that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1562.9s	1562.9	 time, the idea that any app of that scale would use their own data centers made no technical sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1568.9s	1568.9	 whatsoever. It made the app laggy. It made it hard to use it made it more prone to downtime,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1573.7s	1573.7	 to your point. But that being said, I would be shocked if they haven't made meaningful improvements,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1579.0s	1579.0	 because the stack of the internet has gotten so much better over the last seven years. And so to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1584.2s	1584.2	 your point, David, if they didn't take advantage of all these new abstractions and mechanisms to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1588.7s	1588.7	 mechanisms to rebuild the app or to rebuild search or to rebuild, you know, how you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1594.4s	1594.4	 all these infrastructure elements of the app work, I would be really surprised because then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1598.4s	1598.4	 what are they doing over there? Yeah. Well, look, I mean, to the point earlier, besides the product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1602.6s	1602.6	 points, there was a really good tweet, I liked that said, for what it's worth, I think Elon will show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1612.0s	1612.0	 us just how lean the Silicon Valley advertising companies can be run. At the very least, it'll be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1616.6s	1616.6	 an interesting thought experiment for spectators. Because if he does go in and actually does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1621.9s	1621.9	 significantly reduce op x and headcount, and the company does turn profitable, and he can grow it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1627.4s	1627.4	 well, it'll really by the way, it'll really be a beacon for the financial big companies. Yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1632.5s	1632.5	 from a financial perspective, there is $10 a share in op x cuts that he should make right away just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1637.6s	1637.6	 so that he is economically breakeven. And he looks like every other M&A transaction, you know, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1643.2s	1643.2	 paid a 30% premium and you bought a company, there's a lot of margin of safety there if Elon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1648.1s	1648.1	 does that. So to your point, there probably is, and there probably needs to be a meaningful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1652.1s	1652.1	 riff at Twitter. I'm not saying it's right. I'm not saying it's, you know, and I feel for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1655.6s	1655.6	 people that may go through it. But from a financial perspective, the math makes sense for him to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1660.8s	1660.8	 that, because then he is a breakeven proposition on a go in M&A transaction. And I think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1666.5s	1666.5	 there's, there's a lot of intelligent financial sense, so that all the debt holders feel like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1671.8s	1671.8	 he's doing the right thing, and all the equity holders particularly see a chance for them to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1676.4s	1676.4	 make a decent return here. All right, well, let's move on. This is a great conversation between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1683.6s	1683.6	 Chamath, Pali Hapitiya and Dave Friedberg about the Twitter transaction. And now we're being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1689.6s	1689.6	 rejoined by our besties who are- Yeah, by other besties.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1693.9s	1693.9	 Yeah. How was your cappuccino, J. Cal? That was great. I have a nice cold brew here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1698.9s	1698.9	 a nice iced cold brew and a nice drip coffee. I'm working both.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1702.4s	1702.4	 I'd love to talk about topics that I'm not being subpoenaed or depositioned about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1706.5s	1706.5	 We will have a lot to say in the coming weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1708.5s	1708.5	 I'd love to talk about topics that my lawyers have advised me not to talk about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1712.3s	1712.3	 That's brutal. How eerie was our prediction?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1714.2s	1714.2	 51 bucks a share. It is exactly where the stock is right now. That's eerie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1718.6s	1718.6	 Yeah. All right. Lots of advances. Let's keep going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1721.8s	1721.8	 Yeah. Speaking of Elon, Tesla AI Day was last week. I actually went. It was great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1728.3s	1728.3	 This is a recruiting event where- What did you do after?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1731.5s	1731.5	 Phil Hellmuth and I went and I drove Phil Hellmuth home. The end. No, it's a great event. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1739.2s	1739.2	 it is essentially a giant recruiting event. Hundreds of AI-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1743.6s	1743.6	 Sorry, I'm sorry. Can we just talk about Phil Hellmuth's non sequitur in the group chat about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1748.6s	1748.6	 Ken Griffin? I mean-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1752.2s	1752.2	 Oh yeah. Where he's just like, I made a joke about his net worth and-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1756.9s	1756.9	 What is going on? We were talking about the most serious of topics and he just comes-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1761.0s	1761.0	 Seven seconds to Phil. What's going on? Seven seconds to Phil.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1765.3s	1765.3	 By the way, I was texting with Daniel Nagranu. He did an incredible podcast. If you guys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1772.5s	1772.5	 with Lex Friedman, if you haven't listened to it, the Daniel Nagranu pod with Lex is incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1778.0s	1778.0	 Oh, I got a lot of- But I was joking with Daniel that there's a section where he's talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1782.0s	1782.0	 the greatest poker players of all time. And if you look in the bar of YouTube, it shows where the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1787.2s	1787.2	 most viewership was. And it was exactly the 30 seconds he talks about Hellmuth. And I said to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1792.4s	1792.4	 Daniel, this must've been Phil re-watching it over. I put it on loop. He went to bed with it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1798.1s	1798.1	 like it was ASMR to put him to bed. Just Nagranu talking about him. Sorry, Jacob. Sorry about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1804.4s	1804.4	 No, no, it's all good. So anyway, the event was super impressive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1810.3s	1810.3	 Elon only spoke when he showed the Optimus, the new robot. He's building a general purpose robot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1816.5s	1816.5	 that will work in the factories. It's very early days, but they showed two versions of it. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1822.6s	1822.6	 he said he thinks they could get it down to $20,000. It's going to work in the factory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1825.8s	1825.8	 So it's actually got a purpose. And obviously, the factories already have a ton of robots,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1829.6s	1829.6	 but this is more of a robot that will benefit from the general or the computer vision and the AI,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1838.9s	1838.9	 the narrow AI being pursued by the self-driving team. This is like two and a half hours of really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1843.5s	1843.5	 intense presentations. The most interesting part for me was they're building their own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1847.6s	1847.6	 supercomputer and their chips and the dojo supercomputer was really impressive at how much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1856.3s	1856.3	 they can get through scenarios. So they're building every scenario of every self-driving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1861.4s	1861.4	 I actually have the full self-driving beta on my car. I've been using it. It's pretty impressive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1867.2s	1867.2	 I have to say. If you haven't used it yet, I feel like AI is moving at a pretty advanced clip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1875.4s	1875.4	 the past year. If you haven't also seen meta announced a text to video generator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1880.2s	1880.2	 So this is even more impressive than Dolly. Dolly, you put in a couple of words,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1884.5s	1884.5	 Friedberg, and you get a painting or whatever. This is put in a couple of words and you get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1889.2s	1889.2	 a short video. So they had one of a teddy bear painting a teddy bear. So it looks like you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1894.5s	1894.5	 going to be able to essentially create a whole movie by just talking to a computer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1901.3s	1901.3	 Really impressive. Where do you think we are, Friedberg, in terms of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1906.3s	1906.3	 the compounding nature of these narrow AI efforts? You know, obviously we saw poker, chess,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1911.7s	1911.7	 Go, Dolly, GPT-3, self-driving. It feels like this is all compounding at a faster rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1919.8s	1919.8	 Or am I just imagining that? Yeah, look, I mean, it's interesting when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1923.5s	1923.5	 when people saw the first computer playing chess, they said the same thing. I think any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1927.4s	1927.4	 time that you see progress with a computer that starts to mimic the predictive capabilities of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1933.1s	1933.1	 human, it's impressive. But I will argue, and I'll say a few words on this. I think this is part of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1941.8s	1941.8	 a 60 year cycle that we've been going through. Fundamentally, what humans and human brains do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1949.6s	1949.6	 is we can sense our external environment, then we generate knowledge from that sensing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1955.4s	1955.4	 and then our brains build a model that predicts an outcome. And then that predicted outcome is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1960.7s	1960.7	 what drives our actions and our behavior. We observe the sun rise every morning, then we observe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1965.1s	1965.1	 that it sets, and you see that enough times and you build a predictive model from that data that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1969.2s	1969.2	 been generated in your brain that I predict that the sun has risen, it will therefore set, it has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1975.2s	1975.2	 set, it will therefore rise. And I think that the computing approach is very similar. It's all about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1980.3s	1980.3	 sensing or generating data, and then creating a predictive model, and then you can drive action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1985.0s	1985.0	 And initially, the first approach was just basic algorithms. And these are deterministic models
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1990.6s	1990.6	 that are built. It's a piece of code that says here's an input, here's an output. And that model
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=1995.9s	1995.9	 is really built by a human. And a human designed that algorithmic model and said this is what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2001.9s	2001.9	 predictive potential of this software is. Then there was this term called data science. So as data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2008.2s	2008.2	 generation began to proliferate, meaning there was far more sensors in the world, it was really cheap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2013.7s	2013.7	 to create digital data from the physical world, really cheap to transmit it, really cheap to store
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2018.0s	2018.0	 it, really cheap to compute with it. Data science became the hot term in Silicon Valley for a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2022.8s	2022.8	 And these models were not just a basic algorithm written by a human, but it became an algorithm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2028.4s	2028.4	 that was a similar deterministic model that had parameters. And the parameters were ultimately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2035.0s	2035.0	 resolved by the data that was being generated. And so these models became much more complex and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2039.8s	2039.8	 much more predictive, finer granularities, finer range. Then we used this term machine learning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2045.6s	2045.6	 And in the data science era, it was still like, hey, there's a model and you would solve it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2051.5s	2051.5	 statically. You would get a bunch of data, you would statically solve for the parameters,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2055.0s	2055.0	 and that would be your model and it would run. Machine learning then allowed those parameters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2059.2s	2059.2	 to become dynamic. So the model was static, but generally speaking, the parameters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2063.8s	2063.8	 that drove the model became dynamic as more data came into the system and they were dynamically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2070.2s	2070.2	 updated. And then this era of AI became, and that's the new catchword. And what AI is realizing is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2075.9s	2075.9	 that there's so much data that rather than just resolve the parameters of the model, you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2080.9s	2080.9	 actually resolve a model itself. The algorithm can be written by the data, the algorithm can be written
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2086.2s	2086.2	 by the software. And so with AI, example, so poker playing an adaptive model. So you're playing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2094.2s	2094.2	 poker and the software begins to recognize behavior and it builds a predictive model that says, here's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2099.1s	2099.1	 how you're playing. And then over time, it actually changes not just the parameters of the model,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2103.4s	2103.4	 but the model itself, the algorithm itself. And so AI, and then it eventually gets to a point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2108.0s	2108.0	 where the algorithm is so much more complex that a human would have never written it. And suddenly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2112.8s	2112.8	 the AI has built its own intelligence, its own ability to be predictive in a way that a human
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2117.4s	2117.4	 algorithmic programmer would have never done. And this is all driven by statistics. So none of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2123.2s	2123.2	 is new science per se. There's new techniques that all on their underlying use statistics as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2129.2s	2129.2	 their basis. And then there's these techniques that allow us to build these new systems of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2132.8s	2132.8	 model development like neural nets and so on. And those statistics build those neural nets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2137.6s	2137.6	 they solve those parameters and so on. But fundamentally, there is a geometric increase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2143.2s	2143.2	 in data and a geometric decline in the cost to generate data from sensors, because the cost of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2148.8s	2148.8	 sensors is coming down with Moore's law, transmit that data because the cost of moving data has come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2153.1s	2153.1	 down with broadband communications, the cost of storing data because the cost of DRAM and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2159.0s	2159.0	 solid state hard drives has come down with Moore's law. And now the ability to actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2162.9s	2162.9	 have enough data to do this AI driven where people are calling AI, but it really is the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2167.8s	2167.8	 It's part of a spectrum of things that have been going on for 60 years to actually drive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2171.5s	2171.5	 predictions in the world is really being realized in a bunch of areas that we would have historically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2177.2s	2177.2	 been really challenged and surprised to see. And so my argument is at this point data played a big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2183.0s	2183.0	 role. Yeah. Yeah. Over the last decade, we've reached this tipping point in terms of data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2187.3s	2187.3	 generation, storage and computation that's allowed these statistical models to resolve dynamically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2193.2s	2193.2	 and as a result, they are far more predictive. And as a result, we see far more human like behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2199.2s	2199.2	 in the predictive systems, both physical, both those that are, you know, like a, like a robot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2203.8s	2203.8	 is the same as one that existed 20 years ago. But the way that it's run is using the software that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2208.8s	2208.8	 is driven by this dynamic model. And that data allows for a better answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2213.8s	2213.8	 Tramath. Okay, I have two things to say, but one, the first one is a total non sequitur. So use the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2219.2s	2219.2	 term data scientist. Do you know where the term data scientist came from? As classically used in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2225.5s	2225.5	 Silicon Valley, it came from Facebook and it came from my team in a critical moment. This was in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2231.4s	2231.4	 2007. I was trying to 2008. I was trying to build the growth team. This is the team that became very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2237.4s	2237.4	 famous for getting to a billion users and, you know, building a lot of these algorithmic insights.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2242.2s	2242.2	 And I was trying to recruit a person from Google and he was like a PhD in some crazy thing like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2249.9s	2249.9	 astrophysics or particle physics or something. And we gave him an offer as a data analyst,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2255.7s	2255.7	 because this is what I needed at the time. This is what I thought I needed an analyst,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2259.0s	2259.0	 you know, to analyze data. And he said, absolutely not. I'm offended by the job title.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2264.8s	2264.8	 And I remember talking to my, my HR, you know, business process partner, and I asked her like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2270.0s	2270.0	 I don't understand what is this? Where's this coming from? And she said, he fashions himself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2274.3s	2274.3	 a scientist. And I said, well, then call him a data scientist. So we wrote him the offer for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2279.3s	2279.3	 first time, data scientist. And at the time, people internally were like, this is a dumb title. What
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2284.6s	2284.6	 does this mean? Anyways, we hired the guy, he was a star. And, and that title just took off internally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2291.4s	2291.4	 So Rob, it's funny because parallel, we started climate corp in 2006. And the original, the first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2295.9s	2295.9	 guy I hired was a buddy of mine who was a 4.0 for applied math from Cal. And then everyone we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2300.6s	2300.6	 hired on with him, we called them the math team and they were all applied math and statistics,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2306.0s	2306.0	 PhDs. And we called them the math team. And it was really cool to be part of the math team.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2310.1s	2310.1	 But then we switched the team name to data scientist. And then it obviously created this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2315.0s	2315.0	 much more kind of impressive role, impressive title, central function to the organization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2320.7s	2320.7	 that was more than just a math person or data analyst. As I think it may have been classically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2325.4s	2325.4	 treated because they really were building the algorithms that drove the models that made the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2329.8s	2329.8	 product work, right? Peter Thiel has a very funny observation, not funny, but you know, observation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2334.6s	2334.6	 which is you should always be wary of any science that actually has science in the name, political
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2340.2s	2340.2	 science, social science, I guess, maybe data scientists, you know, because the real sciences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2344.9s	2344.9	 don't need to qualify themselves, physics, chemistry, biology. Anyways, that's so here's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2349.4s	2349.4	 what I wanted to talk about with respect to AI. Two very important observations that I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2355.0s	2355.0	 is useful for people to know. The first one, Nick, if you throw it up here is just a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2359.0s	2359.0	 baseline of, you know, when we have thought about intelligence and compute capability,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2363.7s	2363.7	 we've always talked about Moore's law. And Moore's law essentially this idea that there is a fixed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2368.3s	2368.3	 amount of time where the density of transistors inside of a chip would double and roughly that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2374.9s	2374.9	 period for many, many years was around two years. And it was largely led by Intel. And we used to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2380.6s	2380.6	 equate this to intelligence, meaning the more density there was in a chip, the more things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2386.2s	2386.2	 could be learned and understood. And we used to think about that as the progression of how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2392.8s	2392.8	 computing intelligence would grow and eventually AI and artificial intelligence would get to mass
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2398.2s	2398.2	 market. Well, what we are now at is a place where many people have said Moore's law has broken. Why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2406.1s	2406.1	 It's because we cannot cram any more transistors into a fixed amount of area. We are at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2411.6s	2411.6	 boundaries of physics. And so people think, well, does that mean that our ability to compute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2418.8s	2418.8	 will essentially come to an end and stop? And the answer is no. And that's what's demonstrated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2423.9s	2423.9	 on this next chart, just to make it simple, which is that what you really see is that if you think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2429.1s	2429.1	 about super computing power, so the ability to get to an answer that has actually continued
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2436.7s	2436.7	 unabated. And if you look at this chart, the reason why this is possible is entirely because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2443.0s	2443.0	 we've shifted from CPUs to these things called GPUs. So you may have heard companies like Nvidia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2448.9s	2448.9	 why is companies like Nvidia done so well? It's because they said they raised their hand and said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2453.9s	2453.9	 we can take on the work. And by taking on the work away from a traditional CPU, you're able to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2460.5s	2460.5	 a lot of what Friedberg said is get into these very complicated models. So this is just an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2465.2s	2465.2	 observation that I think that we are continuing to compound knowledge and intelligence effectively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2473.7s	2473.7	 at the same rate as Moore's law. And we will continue to be able to do that because this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2479.9s	2479.9	 makes it a problem of power and a problem of money. So as long as you can buy enough GPUs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2487.0s	2487.0	 from Nvidia or build your own, and as long as you can get access to enough power to run those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2493.2s	2493.2	 computers, there really isn't many problems you can't solve. And that's what's so fascinating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2499.0s	2499.0	 and interesting. And this is what companies like OpenAI are really proving. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2503.4s	2503.4	 when they raised a billion dollars, what they did was they attacked this problem, because they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2508.2s	2508.2	 realized that by shifting the problem to GPUs, it left all these amazing opportunities for them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2514.8s	2514.8	 to uncover. And that's effectively what they have. The second thing that I'll say very quickly is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2520.6s	2520.6	 it's been really hard for us as a society to build intelligence in a multimodal way like our brain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2529.2s	2529.2	 works. So think about how our brain works. Our brain works in a multimodal way. We can process
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2534.5s	2534.5	 imagery, we can process words and sounds, we can process all of these different modes, text
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2542.6s	2542.6	 into one system, and then intuit some intelligence from it and make a decision, right? So you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2549.0s	2549.0	 we could be watching this YouTube video, there's going to be transcription, there's video, voice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2553.4s	2553.4	 audio, everything all at once. And we are moving to a place very quickly where computers will have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2559.9s	2559.9	 that same ability as well. Today, we go to very specific models and kind of balkanize silos,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2565.9s	2565.9	 correct solve different kinds of problems. But those are now quickly merging again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2570.2s	2570.2	 because of what I just said about GPUs. So I think what's really important about AI for everybody to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2576.7s	2576.7	 understand is the marginal cost of intelligence is going to go to zero. And this is where I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2582.8s	2582.8	 just going to put out another prediction of my own. When that happens, it's going to be incredibly

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2594.8s	2594.8	 humans to differentiate ourselves is to be more human. It's to be less compute intensive. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2601.7s	2601.7	 to be more empathetic, it's to be more emotional, not less emotional, because those differentiators
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2607.7s	2607.7	 are very difficult for brute force compute to solve. Be careful, the replicants on this call
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2613.0s	2613.0	 getting a little nervous here. They're not processing that that was an emotional statement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2617.0s	2617.0	 Do not want to process that one. Well, I to your point, during this AI day, they were showing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2624.0s	2624.0	 in self driving, as you're talking about this balkanization, and trying to make decisions across
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2629.4s	2629.4	 many different decision trees, you know, they're looking at lane changes, they're looking at other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2635.1s	2635.1	 cars and pedestrians are looking at road conditions like fog and rain. And then they're using all this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2640.7s	2640.7	 big data to your point, Friedberg to run tons of different simulations. So they're building like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2646.2s	2646.2	 this virtual world on Market Street, and then they will throw people, dogs, cars, people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2654.7s	2654.7	 into the simulation. It's such a wonderful example. Imagine that system hears a horn. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2661.4s	2661.4	 Well, you hear a horn. So clearly, there's some auditory expression of risk, right? There's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2666.6s	2666.6	 something risky. And now you have to scan your visual field, you have to probabilistically decide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2673.2s	2673.2	 what it could be, what the evasive maneuver, if anything should be. So that's a multimodal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2679.6s	2679.6	 set of intelligence that today isn't really available. Yeah, but we have to get there if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2684.8s	2684.8	 we're going to have real full self driving. So that's a perfect example, Jason, a real world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2688.6s	2688.6	 example of how hard the problem is, but it'll get solved because we can brute force it now with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2693.4s	2693.4	 with chips and with compute. I think that's going to be the very interesting thing with the robots
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2697.1s	2697.1	 as well as all of these decisions they're making, moving cars, the roads, all of a sudden,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2704.0s	2704.0	 we're going to see that with VTOLs vertical takeoff and landing, you know, aircraft,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2709.1s	2709.1	 and we're going to see it with this general robot. And everybody wanted to ask Ilan about general AI,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2714.2s	2714.2	 you know, the Terminator kind of stuff. And his position is, I think, if we solve enough of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2719.4s	2719.4	 problems, Friedberg, it'll be an emergent behavior or an emergent phenomenon, I guess would be a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2725.3s	2725.3	 better word, based on each of these cities crumbling, you know, each of these tasks getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2730.2s	2730.2	 solved by groups of people. You have any thoughts as we wrap up here on the discussion about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2734.9s	2734.9	 a general AI and the timeline for that? Because obviously, we're going to solve every vertical AI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2739.7s	2739.7	 problem in short order. I spoke about this a little bit on the ask AMA on call in on Tuesday night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2747.5s	2747.5	 One sex gets it out, you can listen to it. But I really have this strong belief that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2753.4s	2753.4	 servers crash. No AI team at all. This episode drops. Oh, my God. Yeah, you guys can try to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2759.4s	2759.4	 download the app, but it might crash. So just be careful. So here's, here's my, my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2765.1s	2765.1	 free bird that you were 10 times more popular than J Cal. So it was unexpected levels of traffic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2770.4s	2770.4	 Well, you had, you did have an account with 11,000 followers. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2774.7s	2774.7	 you're right. We'll put you on that account next time. Yeah, please. I'm starting from zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2780.0s	2780.0	 Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. Yeah. Look, my core thesis is I think humans transition from being,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2786.8s	2786.8	 let's call it, you know, passive in the system on earth to being laborers. And then we transition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2793.8s	2793.8	 from being laborers to being creators. And I think our next transition with AI is to transition from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2799.0s	2799.0	 being creators to being narrators. And what I mean by that is as, as we started to do work on earth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2804.6s	2804.6	 and engineer the world around us, we did labor to do that. We literally plowed the fields,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2810.4s	2810.4	 we walked distances, we built things. And over time we built machines that automated a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2816.3s	2816.3	 that labor, you know, everything from a plow to a tractor, to a caterpillar equipment, to a microwave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2823.3s	2823.3	 that cooks for us, labor became less, we became less dependent on our labor abilities. And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2828.9s	2828.9	 we got to switch our time and spend our time as creators, as knowledge workers. And a vast majority
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2834.1s	2834.1	 of the developed world now primarily spends their time as knowledge workers creating. And we create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2839.8s	2839.8	 stuff on computers, we do stuff on computers, but we're not doing physical labor anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2844.4s	2844.4	 As a lot of the knowledge work gets supplanted by AI, as it's being termed now, but really gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2850.2s	2850.2	 supplanted by software, the role of the human, I think, transitions to being one of a narrator,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2855.3s	2855.3	 where instead of having to create the blueprint for a house, you narrate the house you want and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2861.4s	2861.4	 the software creates the blueprint for you. And instead of creating the movie and not spending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2866.8s	2866.8	 $100 million producing a movie, you dictate or you narrate the movie you want to see and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2872.0s	2872.0	 iterate with the computer and the computer renders the entire film for you. Because those films are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2876.3s	2876.3	 shown digitally anyway, so you can have a computer render it. Instead of creating a new piece of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2881.5s	2881.5	 content, you narrate the content you want to experience. You create your own video game,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2886.2s	2886.2	 you create your own movie experience. And I think that there's a whole evolution that happens. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2890.2s	2890.2	 if you look, Steve Pinker's book, Enlightenment Now, has a great set of statistics on this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2895.1s	2895.1	 but the amount of time that humans are spending on leisure activities per week has climbed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2900.2s	2900.2	 extraordinarily over the past couple of decades. We spend more time enjoying ourselves and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2904.9s	2904.9	 exploring our creative interests than we ever did in the past in human history, because we were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2909.4s	2909.4	 burdened by all the labor and all the creative and knowledge work we have to do. And now things are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2914.2s	2914.2	 much more accessible to us. And I think that AI allows us to transition into an era that we never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2919.0s	2919.0	 really thought possible or realized, where the limits are really our imagination of what we can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2923.7s	2923.7	 do with the world around us. And the software resolves to the automation resolves to make those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2929.3s	2929.3	 things possible. And that's a really exciting kind of vision for the future that I think AI enables.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2933.8s	2933.8	 Star Trek had this right, people didn't have to work and they could pursue things in the holodeck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2938.3s	2938.3	 or whatever that they felt was rewarding to them. But speaking of jobs, the job reports for August
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2945.3s	2945.3	 came in, we talked about this, we were trimming 300,000 jobs a month. We're wondering if the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2951.3s	2951.3	 shoe would drop, oh boy, did it drop a hundred over a million jobs burned off in August. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2956.6s	2956.6	 without getting into the macro talk, it does feel like what the Fed is doing, and companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2962.5s	2962.5	 doing hiring freezes and cuts is finally finally having an impact if we start losing a million,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2967.4s	2967.4	 as we predicted could happen here on the show. People might actually go back to work and lift
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2975.3s	2975.3	 Uber are reporting that the driver shortages are over, they no longer have to pay people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2979.1s	2979.1	 spits and stuff like that to get people to come back to work. So at least here in America feels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2983.4s	2983.4	 like we're turning a corner. Do we want to go Cal, can we let's talk about the marijuana?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2988.0s	2988.0	 Yeah, breaking news. I didn't just say Yeah, yeah, I was going to say we got a couple of things we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2991.5s	2991.5	 really want to get to here. Ukraine, section 230. And then this breaking news, we'll pull it up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=2996.9s	2996.9	 here on the screen. While we're recording the show, President Biden says, and I'm just going to quote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3002.6s	3002.6	 here. First, I'm pardoning all prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession. There
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3010.4s	3010.4	 are 1000s of people who are were previously convicted of simple possession, who may be denied
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3014.9s	3014.9	 employment, housing or educational opportunities. So my pardon will remove this burden. That's big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3018.9s	3018.9	 news. Second, I'm calling on governors to pardon simple state marijuana possession offenses,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3025.3s	3025.3	 just as no one should be in a federal prison solely for possessing marijuana, nobody should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3029.0s	3029.0	 be in a local jail, or stay prison for that reason either. Finally, this is happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3034.4s	3034.4	 Third, and this is an important one, we classify the marijuana at the same level as heroin and even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3039.6s	3039.6	 and more serious than fentanyl makes no sense. I'm asking Secretary Burrow,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3045.2s	3045.2	 Baccarra and the Attorney General to initiate the process of reviewing how marijuana is scheduled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3049.5s	3049.5	 under federal law. I'd also like to note that as federal and state regulators change, we still need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3056.6s	3056.6	 important limitations on trafficking, marketing and under a shells of marijuana. Thoughts on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3061.2s	3061.2	 breaking news? Is this mo do you think that the timing on this is kind of midterm related? It
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3069.1s	3069.1	 seems is this is this I guess is this a politically popular decision to do? I think so. I mean, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3074.8s	3074.8	 I support it. So I finally did something I like. Great. I mean, I thought that we should decriminalize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3082.8s	3082.8	 marijuana for a long time, or specifically, you know, I agree with this idea of de scheduling it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3088.6s	3088.6	 it does not make sense to treat marijuana the same as heroin as a schedule one narcotic. This
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3094.3s	3094.3	 doesn't make any sense. It should be regulated separately and differently. Obviously, you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3099.2s	3099.2	 to keep it out of the hands of minors, but no one should be going to jail, I think, for simple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3103.3s	3103.3	 possession. So I do agree with this. And I think the thing they need to do, I don't see it mentioned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3108.6s	3108.6	 here is they should pass a federal law that would allow for the normalization of let's call it legal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3117.1s	3117.1	 legal, you know, cannabis companies. So companies that are allowed to operate under state laws,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3125.3s	3125.3	 like in California, should have access to the banking system should have access to payment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3129.4s	3129.4	 rails. Because right now, the reason why the legal cannabis industry isn't working at all in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3135.1s	3135.1	 California is because they can't bank, they can't take payments. So it's this weird all cash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3139.8s	3139.8	 business that makes no sense. So listen, if we're not going to criminalize it as a drug like heroin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3145.9s	3145.9	 if we're going to allow states to make it legal, then allow it to be a more normal business where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3152.3s	3152.3	 the state can tax it. And it can operate in a more above board way. So federal mandate is what you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3159.7s	3159.7	 saying the federal mandate, I think it could still be regulated on a state by state basis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3163.4s	3163.4	 But I think you need the feds to bless the idea that banks and payment companies can take on those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3170.2s	3170.2	 clients, which states have already said are legally operating companies. And right now they can't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3176.1s	3176.1	 And it's a huge gap in the law. So maybe that's the one thing I would add to this. But I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3180.1s	3180.1	 have any complaints about this right now, based on what we know from this tweet storm. And I would say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3185.4s	3185.4	 by the way, was about face. This was an about face by Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3189.0s	3189.0	 Yeah. Do you know what the polling data says? I mean, is there I'm assuming there's big support
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3193.4s	3193.4	 in kind of the independence in the middle for this. It was 70% at one point. Yeah. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3200.6s	3200.6	 So look, this to me, this is the kind of thing that Biden should be doing with the 50 50 Senate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3205.4s	3205.4	 finding these sorts of by-parts and compromises. Right. So yeah, I look, this is good news for us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3211.4s	3211.4	 I'm concerned. Why hasn't this happened in the past? Like what's been the political reason that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3216.0s	3216.0	 other presidents Obama even didn't that have similar ideology? Like why? Why? Why? Does anyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3224.9s	3224.9	 know why this hasn't been done in the past? There was rumors he was going to do in the second term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3229.4s	3229.4	 They just didn't have the political capital to do it. Why? I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3233.0s	3233.0	 Well, pardon doesn't require. Yeah, the pardon doesn't require political capital. I think it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3237.7s	3237.7	 probably the perception that this is soft on crime in some way, or there wasn't enough broad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3243.5s	3243.5	 based support, as David said, I mean, I think the the United States population has moved pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3248.7s	3248.7	 meaningfully in the last 20 years. Look at the chart here. You know, we were talking about 2000,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3254.6s	3254.6	 it was only 31%. And then you look at 2018, it's up at 60 plus percent. So when people saw the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3261.4s	3261.4	 states doing it, and they saw absolutely no problem, you know, in every state, and I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3266.2s	3266.2	 what people will see next, that's a Gallup poll. That's a Gallup poll. So it's increased
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3271.1s	3271.1	 dramatically. MDMA psilocybin and some of these other plant based medicines ayahuasca are next,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3276.6s	3276.6	 and they're doing studies on them. Now, I don't want to take away from how important this is for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3281.7s	3281.7	 all the people from this will positively impact. I just want to talk about the schedule change for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3286.4s	3286.4	 marijuana. As a parent, one of the things that I'm really, really concerned about is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3292.6s	3292.6	 through this process of legalization, getting access to marijuana has frankly become too easy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3298.9s	3298.9	 particularly for kids. At the same time, I saw a lot of really alarming evidence that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3305.8s	3305.8	 the intensity of these marijuana based products have gone, you know, I think it's like five or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3311.3s	3311.3	 six times more intense than the other 50 or 100. Chum off much higher. Right. So so it's no longer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3317.9s	3317.9	 you know, this kind of like, you know, do no harm drug that it was 20 years ago. This is this could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3324.2s	3324.2	 be actually David, the way that it's productized today, as bad as some of these other, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3332.3s	3332.3	 narcotics. So in June of this year, the Biden administration basically made this press release
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3340.0s	3340.0	 that said the FDA is going to come out with regulations that would cap the amount of nicotine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3344.8s	3344.8	 and cigarettes. And I think that was a really smart move, because it basically set the stage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3349.8s	3349.8	 to taper nicotine out of out of cigarettes, which would essentially, you know, decapitate it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3357.0s	3357.0	 as a an addictive product. And I think by thinking about how it's how it's dealt with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3364.5s	3364.5	 what I really hope the administration does is it empowers the FDA, if you're going to legalize it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3371.0s	3371.0	 you need to have expectations around what the intensity of these drugs are. Because if you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3376.6s	3376.6	 delivering drugs, OTC, and now any kid can go in at 18 years old and buy them, which means
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3382.2s	3382.2	 that 18 year olds are going to buy them for 16 year olds, 16 year olds are going to get fake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3386.2s	3386.2	 IDs to buy them for themselves. You need to do a better job so that parents you're helping parents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3391.0s	3391.0	 do our job. Here's what you need to regulate. Shouldn't it be 21 like alcohol? If alcohol is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3397.5s	3397.5	 21, then of course, yeah, fine. But even alcohol, David, you know that there are there are we know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3401.8s	3401.8	 what the intensity of these are, there are labels, and there's warnings, and you know the difference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3405.6s	3405.6	 between beer versus wine versus hard alcohol. But let me just give you some statistics here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3410.2s	3410.2	 Chamath. If you think about the the the cannabis in the 90s, and prior to that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3415.8s	3415.8	 there was very, you've been a ton of studies on this in Colorado, it was the THC content was less
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3420.8s	3420.8	 than 2%. And then in 2017, we were talking about, you know, things going up to 17 to 28% for specific
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3431.2s	3431.2	 strains. So they have been building strains like Girl Scout cookies, etc. that have just increased
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3435.8s	3435.8	 and increased. And then there are things like shards and obviously edibles, you can create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3440.6s	3440.6	 whatever intensity you want. So you have this incredible there, you know, variation, you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3445.8s	3445.8	 have an edible that's, you know, got one milligram of THC got one that has 100, or you could have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3451.2s	3451.2	 pack of edibles. And you see this happen in the news all the time, some kid gets their parents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3455.4s	3455.4	 pack or somebody gives one, and the kids don't know. And this dabbing phenomenon combined with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3461.2s	3461.2	 dabbing is like the shards like this really intense stuff. Combined with the edibles is really the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3466.7s	3466.7	 issue and the labeling of them. So you got to be incredibly careful with this. It's not good for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3471.2s	3471.2	 kids, it screws up their brains. And so yeah, be very careful. I have a zero tolerance policy on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3476.7s	3476.7	 this stuff. I don't care if it's legal or illegal. Like I don't want my kids touching any of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3480.2s	3480.2	 stuff until it's not for kids, obviously. Yeah, but we also should not be until they're 35 or 40. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3485.6s	3485.6	 even then I hope they never do it. But but I need some help. And I'm not sure I'm the only parent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3490.7s	3490.7	 that's asking you can't have this stuff be available effectively sold like in a convenience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3495.2s	3495.2	 store. No, no, that's not gonna happen where there isn't even labeling at least like cigarettes are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3499.6s	3499.6	 labeled. It's very clear how bad this stuff is for you. Do you guys have any feedback on the job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3504.5s	3504.5	 report or anything? They're all going away when when the when the AI wins? Well, that's why I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3509.5s	3509.5	 brought it up is like, we're now going to see a potential, you know, situation where jobs go away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3515.0s	3515.0	 And a lot of the stuff like even developers, right? Don't you think Freeberg developers are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3518.6s	3518.6	 going to start developing tasks? No, I design tasks going to be AI based. Everyone assumes a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3524.3s	3524.3	 static lump of work. I think what happens particularly in things like developer tools,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3529.4s	3529.4	 is the developer can do so much more. And then we generate so much more output. And so the overall
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3534.3s	3534.3	 productivity goes up, not down. So it's pretty exciting as these. And remember, like, like we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3540.5s	3540.5	 were talking on the AMA the other night, Adobe Photoshop was a tool for photographers. So you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3545.4s	3545.4	 didn't have to take the perfect photograph and then print it. You could you know, you could use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3549.1s	3549.1	 the software to improve the quality of your photograph. And I think that that's what we see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3553.4s	3553.4	 happening with all software in the creative process is it helps people do more than they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3557.8s	3557.8	 realize they could do before. And that's pretty powerful. And it opens up all these new avenues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3562.1s	3562.1	 of interest and things we're not even imagining today. All right, so SCOTUS is going to hear two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3566.3s	3566.3	 cases for section 230. The family of Nohima Gonzalez, a 23 year old American college student
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3572.7s	3572.7	 who was killed in an ISIS terrorist attack in Paris back in 2015. Remember those horrible attacks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3578.7s	3578.7	 is claiming that YouTube helped and aided and abetted ISIS. The family's argument is YouTube's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3584.4s	3584.4	 algorithm was recommending videos that make it that makes it a publisher of content. As you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3589.3s	3589.3	 it's section 230 common carrier. If you make editorial decisions, if you promote certain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3594.5s	3594.5	 content, you lose your 230 protections. In court papers filed in 2016, they said the company quote,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3600.0s	3600.0	 no only permitted ISIS to post on YouTube hundreds of radicalizing videos inciting violence,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3605.2s	3605.2	 which helped the group recruit, including some who were actually involved in the terrorist attack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3610.2s	3610.2	 So they have made that connection. Well, look, let's let's be honest, we can we can we can put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3613.9s	3613.9	 a pin in this thing, because I think it would be shocking to me if this current SCOTUS all of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3620.8s	3620.8	 sudden founded in the cockles of their heart to protect big tech. I mean, they've dismantled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3626.2s	3626.2	 a lot of other stuff that I think is a lot more controversial than this. And so, you know, we've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3635.3s	3635.3	 we've basically looked at gun laws, we've looked at affirmative action, we've looked at abortion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3641.4s	3641.4	 rights, sorry. Well, I mean, I think as we've said, I think we all know where that die is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3646.4s	3646.4	 unfortunately, going to get cast. So to me, it just seems like this could be an interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3652.9s	3652.9	 case where it's actually nine zero in favor for complete for completely different sets of reasons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3658.9s	3658.9	 I mean, if you think of the liberal left part of the court, they have their own reasons for saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3663.3s	3663.3	 that there are 230 protections for big tech. And if you look at the far right, or the right leaning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3668.6s	3668.6	 parts members of this of SCOTUS, they have they have another set of different reasons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3672.6s	3672.6	 Make a political decision not illegal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3674.3s	3674.3	 No, but even in their politics, they actually end up in the same place. They both don't want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3678.9s	3678.9	 the protections, but for different reasons. So there's a reasonable outcome here where,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3684.2s	3684.2	 you know, Roberts is going to have a really interesting time trying to pick who writes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3687.8s	3687.8	 the majority opinion. There was a related case in the Fifth Circuit in Texas, where do you guys see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3693.0s	3693.0	 this Fifth Circuit decision where Texas passed a law imposing common carrier restrictions on social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3701.4s	3701.4	 media companies, the idea being that social media companies need to operate like phone companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3706.4s	3706.4	 and they can't just arbitrarily deny you service or deny you access to the platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3711.3s	3711.3	 And the argument why previously that had been viewed actually as unconstitutional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3717.9s	3717.9	 was this idea of compelled speech that you can't compel a corporation to support speech that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3723.8s	3723.8	 don't want to because that was a violation of their own First Amendment rights. And what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3728.0s	3728.0	 first the Fifth Circuit said is no, that doesn't make any sense. Facebook or Twitter can still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3732.6s	3732.6	 advocate for whatever speech they want as a corporation, but as a platform,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3737.0s	3737.0	 they if Texas requires them to not discriminate against people on the basis of viewpoint,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3743.0s	3743.0	 then Texas has the right to to impose that because that doesn't their quote was that does not chill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3749.0s	3749.0	 speech. If anything, it chills censorship. So what's the right legal decision here in your mind,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3753.8s	3753.8	 putting aside politics if you can for a moment, putting on your legal hat, what is the right thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3758.6s	3758.6	 for society? What is the right legal issue around Section 230, specifically in the YouTube case?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3764.2s	3764.2	 And just generally, should we look at YouTube? Should we look at a blogging platform like medium
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3769.4s	3769.4	 or blogger? Twitter? Should we look at those as common carrier? And they're not responsible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3775.9s	3775.9	 for what you publish on them? Obviously, they have to take stuff down if it breaks our terms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3779.6s	3779.6	 of service, etc. Or if it's illegal, I've made the case before that I do think that common
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3783.8s	3783.8	 carrier requirements should apply on some level of the stack to protect the rights of ordinary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3789.6s	3789.6	 Americans to have their speech in the face of these giant monopolies, which could otherwise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3794.5s	3794.5	 deplatform them for arbitrary reasons. Just to, you know, just to explain this a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3799.8s	3799.8	 So historically, there was always a debate between so called positive rights and negative rights. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3807.4s	3807.4	 where the United States started off as a country was with this idea of negative rights, that what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3811.9s	3811.9	 a right meant is that you'd be protected from the government taking some action against you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3816.8s	3816.8	 And if you look at the Bill of Rights, you know, the original rights are all about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3820.5s	3820.5	 protecting the citizen against an intrusion on their liberty by a state or by the federal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3826.3s	3826.3	 government. In other words, Congress shall make no law. It was always a restriction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3830.3s	3830.3	 So the right was negative, but it wasn't sort of positively enforced. And then with the progressive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3834.6s	3834.6	 era, you started seeing, you know, more progressive rights, like, for example, American citizenship,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3841.4s	3841.4	 the right to healthcare, right? That's not protecting you from the government. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3845.0s	3845.0	 saying that the government can be used to give you a right that you didn't otherwise have. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3850.4s	3850.4	 that was sort of the big progressive revolution. My take on it is I actually think that the problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3855.8s	3855.8	 we have in our society right now is that free speech is only a negative right. It's not a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3860.2s	3860.2	 positive right. I think it actually needs to be a positive right. I'm embracing a more progressive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3865.5s	3865.5	 version of rights, but on behalf of sort of this original negative right. So, and the reason is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3871.6s	3871.6	 because the town square got privatized, right? I mean, you used to be able to go anywhere in this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3876.6s	3876.6	 country. There'd be a multiplicity of town squares. Anyone could pull out their soap box,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3880.2s	3880.2	 draw a crowd. They could listen. That's not how speech occurs anymore. It's not on public land or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3885.4s	3885.4	 public spaces. The way that speech, political speech especially, occurs today is in these giant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3890.9s	3890.9	 social networks that have giant network effects and are basically monopolies. So if you don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3896.2s	3896.2	 protect the right to free speech in a positive way, it no longer exists. So you not only believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3902.1s	3902.1	 Wow, that YouTube should keep its section 230, you believe they YouTube shouldn't be able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3907.5s	3907.5	 deplatform as a private company. You know, Alex Jones is but one example, they should have their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3914.4s	3914.4	 free speech rights. And we should lean on that side of forcing YouTube to put Alex Jones or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3919.6s	3919.6	 Twitter to put Trump back on the platform. So that's your position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3923.7s	3923.7	 I'm not saying that the Constitution requires YouTube to do anything. What I'm saying is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3929.1s	3929.1	 if a state like Texas or if the federal government wants to pass a law saying that YouTube, if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3936.8s	3936.8	 are say of a certain size, you're a social network of a certain size, you have monopoly network
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3940.6s	3940.6	 effects, I wouldn't necessarily apply this to all the little guys. But for those big monopolies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3945.5s	3945.5	 we know who they are. If the if the federal government or state wanted to say that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3950.7s	3950.7	 are required to be a common carrier, and they cannot discriminate against certain viewpoints,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3955.7s	3955.7	 I think the government should be allowed to do that because it furthers a positive right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3960.0s	3960.0	 Historically, they've not been able to do that because of this idea because this idea of compelled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3965.4s	3965.4	 speech meaning that it would infringe on YouTube speech rights. I don't think it would. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3970.2s	3970.2	 Google and YouTube can advocate for whatever positions they want. They can produce whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3974.1s	3974.1	 content they want. Yeah, but but the point that I think section 230 kind of makes this point as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3978.4s	3978.4	 well, is that they are platforms, their distribution platforms, they're not publishers. So if they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3983.7s	3983.7	 so especially if they want section 230 protection, they should not be engaging in viewpoint
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3988.0s	3988.0	 discrimination. So now there is a rub here. Can I just say, can I just say, go ahead, your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3991.8s	3991.8	 explanation, David, your explanation that you just gave before was so excellent. Thank you, that it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=3997.8s	3997.8	 allows me to understand it even more clearly. That was really so trim off. Do you think the algorithm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4003.3s	4003.3	 is an act of editorialization? Yes, yes, yes. And so then should YouTube look guys, at the end of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4010.2s	4010.2	 the day, let me let me break down an algorithm for you. Okay, effectively, it is a mathematical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4015.2s	4015.2	 equation of variables and weights. An editor 50 years ago was somebody who had that equation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4024.6s	4024.6	 of variables and weights in his or her mind. Okay. And so all we did was we translated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4031.8s	4031.8	 again, this multimodal model that was in somebody's brain into a model that's mathematical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4038.8s	4038.8	 that sits in code. You're talking about the front page and I think your times. Yeah, and I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4043.8s	4043.8	 it's a fig leaf to say that because there is not an individual person who writes point two in front
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4049.4s	4049.4	 of this one variable and point eight in front of the other, that all of a sudden that this isn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4054.4s	4054.4	 editorial decision making is wrong, we need to understand the current moment in which we live,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4060.6s	4060.6	 which is that these computers are thinking actively for us, they're providing this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4067.3s	4067.3	 you know, computationally intensive decision making and reasoning. And I think it's,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4075.1s	4075.1	 it's pretty ridiculous to assume that that isn't true. That's why when you go to Google and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4079.8s	4079.8	 search for, you know, Michael Jordan, we know what the right Michael Jordan is, because it's reasoned,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4087.0s	4087.0	 there is an algorithm that is doing that it's making an editorial decision around what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4091.4s	4091.4	 right answer is, they have deemed it to be right. And that is just true. And so I think we need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4096.7s	4096.7	 acknowledge that because I think it allows us at least to be in a position to rewrite these laws
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4102.6s	4102.6	 through the lens of the 21st century. And we need to update our understanding for how the world works
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4109.6s	4109.6	 today. And you know, Chamath, there's such an easy way to do this. If you're TikTok, if you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4113.8s	4113.8	 YouTube, if you want section 230, if you want to have common carrier and not be responsible,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4119.2s	4119.2	 what's there, when a user signs up, it should give them the option, would you like to turn on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4123.9s	4123.9	 an algorithm? Here are a series of algorithms which you could turn on, you could bring your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4128.1s	4128.1	 own algorithm, you could write your own algorithm with a bunch of sliders, or here are ones that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4132.8s	4132.8	 other users and services provide, like an app store. So you Chamath could pick one for your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4137.8s	4137.8	 family, your kids, that would be I want one that's leaning towards education and takes out conspiracy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4147.4s	4147.4	 wonderful. Because for example, like, you know, this organization, common sense media,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4150.8s	4150.8	 yes, I love that website, every time I put in a movie, I put common sense media, decide if we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4154.8s	4154.8	 should watch it, or like an I use it a lot for apps, because they're pretty good at just telling you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4159.5s	4159.5	 which which apps are reasonable and unreasonable. But you know, if common sense media could raise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4164.5s	4164.5	 a little bit more money and create an algorithm that would help filter stories in TikTok for my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4171.0s	4171.0	 kids, I'd be more likely to give my kids TikTok when they turn 14. Right now, I know that they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4176.3s	4176.3	 going to sneak it by going to YouTube and looking at YouTube shorts and all these other things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4180.5s	4180.5	 because I cannot control that algorithm. And it does worry me what kind of content that they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4186.2s	4186.2	 getting access to. And you could do this, by the way, Chamath, on the operating system level or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4190.9s	4190.9	 on the router level in your house, you could say I want the common sense algorithm, I will pay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4195.4s	4195.4	 $25 a month, $100 a year for it, we are put it on your router, and then any IP that goes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4200.9s	4200.9	 through it would be programmed properly. I want less violence, I want less sex, you know, whatever,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4205.4s	4205.4	 I think we are as a society, sophisticated enough now, yes, to have these controls. And so I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4212.2s	4212.2	 we need them. And so I think we do need to have the right observation of the current state of play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4219.4s	4219.4	 Friedberg, where do you sit on this? Do you think the algorithm should be? I don't, I don't, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4224.6s	4224.6	 agree with 230. Yeah, I don't fully agree with sacks on the monopolistic assumption. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4233.1s	4233.1	 that there are unpack it, I think that there are other places to access content. And I think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4237.4s	4237.4	 there is still a free market to compete. And it is possible to compete. I think that we saw this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4243.7s	4243.7	 happen with tik tok, we saw it happen with Instagram, we saw it happen with YouTube,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4249.0s	4249.0	 competing against Google Video and Microsoft Video. Prior to that, there has been a very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4253.7s	4253.7	 significant battle for the attention of kind of being the next gen of media businesses. And we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4259.7s	4259.7	 have seen Spotify compete. And we're seeing Spotify continue to be challenged by emerging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4264.5s	4264.5	 competitors. So I don't buy the assumption that these are built in monopolies. And therefore,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4270.8s	4270.8	 it allows some regulatory process to come in and say, hey, free speech needs to be actively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4277.2s	4277.2	 enforced because they're monopolies. This isn't like when utilities laid power lines, and sewer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4282.6s	4282.6	 lines and trains across the country. And they had a physical monopoly on being able to access and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4289.0s	4289.0	 move goods and services. The internet is still thank God knock on wood open. And the ability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4293.8s	4293.8	 for anyone to build a competing service is still possible. And there is a lot of money that would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4299.0s	4299.0	 love to disrupt these businesses that is actively doing it. And I think every day, look at how big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4303.8s	4303.8	 tik tok has gotten. It is bigger than YouTube almost or will be soon. And there is a competition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4309.6s	4309.6	 that happens. And because of that competition, I think that the market will ultimately choose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4315.2s	4315.2	 where they want to get their content from and how they want to consume it. And I don't think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4318.5s	4318.5	 that the government should play a role. Sacks rebuttal to that you buy that? Well, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4323.4s	4323.4	 not all these companies are monopolies. But I think they act in a monopolistic way with respect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4328.1s	4328.1	 to restricting free speech, which is they act as a cartel, they all share like best practices with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4333.8s	4333.8	 each other on how to restrict speech. And we saw the watershed here was when Trump was thrown off,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4340.3s	4340.3	 first Twitter made the decision, you know, Jack, I don't know if it was Jack, but basically the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4345.0s	4345.0	 company Jack said it wasn't him. Actually, he said it was the woman who was running it specifically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4348.7s	4348.7	 Exactly. She got desperate for that. Yeah, Jack actually said it was a mistake. But any event,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4353.0s	4353.0	 Twitter did it first. And then all the other companies followed suit. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4356.6s	4356.6	 even like Pinterest and Okta and Snapchat, like officially Facebook, YouTube, everybody. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4363.3s	4363.3	 But Trump was actually on Facebook. He wasn't on all these other companies. They still threw him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4366.6s	4366.6	 off. So they all copy each other. And Jack actually said that in his comments where he said it was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4371.8s	4371.8	 mistake. He said he didn't realize the way in which Twitter's action would actually cascade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4378.9s	4378.9	 He said that he thought originally that the action was okay, because it was just Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4383.7s	4383.7	 decided to take away Trump's right to free speech. But he could still go to all these other companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4388.2s	4388.2	 And then all these other companies, basically, you know, they are all subject to the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4393.4s	4393.4	 political forces. The leadership of these companies are all sort of they all drink from the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4398.2s	4398.2	 monocultural fountain. They all have the same political biases. The polls show this. So the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4402.7s	4402.7	 problem of Freeberg is, yeah, I agree. A bunch of these companies aren't quite monopolies, but they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4406.2s	4406.2	 all act the same way. I hate to say it, but I agree with you, I'm agreeing with you. The collective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4410.6s	4410.6	 effect is of a speech cartel. So the question is, how do you protect the rights of Americans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4416.2s	4416.2	 to free speech in the face of a speech cartel that wants to basically block them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4420.6s	4420.6	 Go ahead, Freeberg respond. Here's my argument. My argument is that these are not public service
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4424.2s	4424.2	 providers. They're private service providers. And the market is telling them what to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4428.2s	4428.2	 The market is saying and I think I don't think so. I think that the pressure that was felt by these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4433.1s	4433.1	 folks was that so many consumers were pissed off that they were letting Trump rail on or they were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4438.3s	4438.3	 pissed off about Jan six, they were pissed off about whatever, whatever the current fat is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4443.4s	4443.4	 the trend is they respond to the market and they say, you know what, this is cross the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4448.3s	4448.3	 And this was the case on public television when nudity came out and they're like, okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4452.2s	4452.2	 you know what, we need to take that off the TV. We need to, because the market is telling us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4456.1s	4456.1	 they're going to boycott us. And I think that there's a market pressure here that we're ignoring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4460.2s	4460.2	 that is actually pretty, pretty relevant that as a private service provider, if they're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4464.6s	4464.6	 lose half their audience, because people are pissed about one or two pieces of content showing up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4469.4s	4469.4	 that they're acting in the best interest of their shareholders and in the best interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4473.2s	4473.2	 of their platform, they're not acting as a public service. Oh, look, I love market forces as much as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4477.7s	4477.7	 the next libertarian, but I just think that fundamentally that's just not what's going on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4482.6s	4482.6	 here. This has nothing to do with market forces as everything to do with political forces. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4486.6s	4486.6	 what's driving this. Look, do you think the average consumer, the average user of PayPal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4491.5s	4491.5	 is demanding that they engage in all of these restrictive policies, throwing off all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4495.9s	4495.9	 accounts who have the wrong viewpoints? No, that has nothing to do with it. It has to do with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4499.8s	4499.8	 vocal minority. Yeah, it's a small number of people who are political activists who work at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4505.7s	4505.7	 these companies and create pressure from below. It's also the people from outside, the activists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4511.1s	4511.1	 who create these boycott campaigns and pressure from outside. And then it's basically people on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4515.8s	4515.8	 Capitol Hill who have the same ideology, who basically create threats from above. So these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4520.2s	4520.2	 companies are under enormous pressure from above, below and sideways. And it's 100% political.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4525.9s	4525.9	 Hold on. It's not about maximizing profits. I think it's about maximizing political outcomes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4534.3s	4534.3	 That is what the American people need to be protected from. Now, I will add one nuance to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4539.1s	4539.1	 my theory though, which is I'm not sure what level of the stack we should declare to be common carrier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4546.4s	4546.4	 So in other words, you may be right actually that at the level of YouTube or Twitter or Facebook,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4552.9s	4552.9	 maybe we shouldn't make them common carrier. And I'll tell you why. Just to take the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4557.3s	4557.3	 side of the argument for a second, which is those companies do have legitimate reasons to take down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4564.3s	4564.3	 some content. I don't like the way they do it, but I do not want to see bots on there. I do not want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4569.0s	4569.0	 to see fake accounts. And I actually don't want to see truly hateful speech or harassment. And the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4575.8s	4575.8	 problem is I do worry that if you subject them to common carrier, they won't actually be able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4580.7s	4580.7	 engage in, let's say, legitimate curation of their social networks. However, so there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4587.2s	4587.2	 real debate to be had there and it's going to be messy. But I think there's one level of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4591.9s	4591.9	 stack below that, which is at the level of pipes, like an AWS, like a CloudFlare, like a PayPal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4597.6s	4597.6	 like the ISPs, like the banks, they are not doing any content moderation or they have no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4603.2s	4603.2	 legitimate reason to be doing content moderation. None of those companies should be allowed to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4606.6s	4606.6	 engage in viewpoint discrimination. We have a problem right now where American citizens are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4611.2s	4611.2	 being denied access to payment rails and to the banking system because of their viewpoints.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4616.0s	4616.0	 So wait, hold on. You're saying AWS shouldn't be able to deny service to the CluClux
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4619.0s	4619.0	 clan or some hate speech group? I think that they should be under the same requirements the phone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4623.6s	4623.6	 company is under. Okay. So when you frame it that way, the question is like, look, I could frame the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4631.0s	4631.0	 same question to you. Should such and such horrible group be able to get a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4637.3s	4637.3	 phone account? Right? Yeah. No, no, no. And you'd say, no, they shouldn't get anything, but they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4641.0s	4641.0	 have that right. That has been litigated and that's been pretty much protected by the Supreme Court.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4645.6s	4645.6	 You know, even if it's a government conferred monopoly, the Supreme Court has said, okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4650.1s	4650.1	 listen, like it's not violating one's constitutional right. For example, if your water bill gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4654.9s	4654.9	 terminated without you getting due process. And the inverse is also true. So for whether we like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4662.9s	4662.9	 it or not that Jason, that issue has been litigated. I think, I think, I think for me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4668.7s	4668.7	 again, just like practically speaking for the functioning of civil society, I think it's very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4674.0s	4674.0	 important for us to now introduce this idea of algorithmic choice. And I don't think that that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4681.0s	4681.0	 will happen in the absence of us rewriting section 230 in a more intelligent way. I don't know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4687.0s	4687.0	 I don't know whether this specific case creates enough standing for us to do all of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4694.5s	4694.5	 But I think it's an important thing that we have to revisit as a society because Jason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4699.8s	4699.8	 what you described as having a breadth of algorithmic choices over time, where there are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4705.4s	4705.4	 purveyors and sellers, could you imagine that's not a job or a company that the four of us would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4710.2s	4710.2	 ever have imagined could be possible five years ago. But maybe there should be an economy of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4715.2s	4715.2	 algorithms and there are these really great algorithms that one would want to pay a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4719.9s	4719.9	 subscription for because one believes in the quality of what it gives you. We should have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4725.0s	4725.0	 that choice. And I think it's an important set of choices that will allow actually,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4729.5s	4729.5	 YouTube as an example to operate more safely as a platform, because it can say, Listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4734.5s	4734.5	 I've created this set of abstractions, you can plug in all sorts of algorithms, there's a default
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4739.0s	4739.0	 algorithm that works, but then there's a marketplace of algorithms, just like there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4742.4s	4742.4	 a marketplace of ideas. I don't discriminate and let people choose. This is the key thing here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4748.2s	4748.2	 It's a model. If it was on a blockchain, if all the videos, all the video content was uploaded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4753.1s	4753.1	 to a public blockchain, and then distributed on distributed computing system, then your ability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4758.6s	4758.6	 to search and use that media would be a function of a service provider you're willing to pay for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4763.9s	4763.9	 that provides the best service experience. And by the way, this is also why I think over time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4767.4s	4767.4	 to kind of Sachs and I are both arguing both sides a little bit, but I think that what will happen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4774.5s	4774.5	 I don't think that the government should come in and regulate these guys and tell them that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4777.8s	4777.8	 they can't take stuff down and whatnot. I really don't like the precedent it sets, period. I also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4782.7s	4782.7	 think that it's a terrible idea for YouTube and Twitter to take stuff down. And I think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4788.9s	4788.9	 there's an incredibly difficult balance that they're going to have to find because if they do this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4793.8s	4793.8	 as we're seeing right now, the quality of the experience for a set of users declines and they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4798.2s	4798.2	 will find somewhere else, any market will develop for something else to compete effectively against
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4802.5s	4802.5	 them. And so that's why I don't like the government intervening because I want to see a better product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4807.2s	4807.2	 emerge when the big company makes some stupid mistake and does a bad job and then the market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4811.7s	4811.7	 will find a better outcome. And it's messy in the middle. And as soon as you do government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4817.0s	4817.0	 intervention on these things and tell them what they can and can't take down, I really do think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4821.8s	4821.8	 that over time, you will limit the user experience to what is possible if you allow the free market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4827.1s	4827.1	 This is where the industry needs to police itself. If you look at the movie industry with the MPAA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4832.8s	4832.8	 and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, they came out with the PG 13 rating specifically for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4837.4s	4837.4	 things that were a little too edgy for PG. This is where our industry could get ahead of this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4843.2s	4843.2	 they could give algorithmic choice and algorithmic app store. And if you look at the original sin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4848.6s	4848.6	 it was these lifetime bands like Trump should not have been given a lifetime ban. They should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4852.4s	4852.4	 have given them a one year ban. They should have had a process and because they overreached,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4856.7s	4856.7	 we wouldn't be in this position. But Jason, when you talk about when you talk about like having a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4862.0s	4862.0	 industry consortium like the MPAA, what you're doing is formalizing the communication that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4866.2s	4866.2	 already taking place already happening between these companies. And what is the result of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4869.9s	4869.9	 communication? They all standardized on overly restrictive policies because they all share
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4874.1s	4874.1	 free political bias. No, no, but if they did it correctly, it's all in the execution sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4878.4s	4878.4	 It has to be executed properly like the movie industry. It doesn't matter. You'll end up with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4882.6s	4882.6	 the same problem as having the government intervene. If you have the government intervene
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4885.4s	4885.4	 or private body intervene, any sort of set standard intervention that prevents the market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4890.6s	4890.6	 from competing. I disagree with you. I think you can create more competition if the government says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4895.7s	4895.7	 okay, folks, you can have the standard algorithm, but you need to make a simple abstracted way for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4902.4s	4902.4	 somebody else to write some other filtering mechanism and to basically so that users can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4906.6s	4906.6	 pick power users. Yes, I don't like it. What the MPAA did was I don't understand why isn't that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4913.0s	4913.0	 more choice because as a product company, I don't want to be told how to make my product,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4917.8s	4917.8	 right? If you're not YouTube, you have an algo. You're now saying that there is this distinction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4922.0s	4922.0	 of the algo from the UX from the data. And my choice might be to create different content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4926.3s	4926.3	 libraries. For example, YouTube has YouTube kids and it's a different content library and it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4931.0s	4931.0	 different user interface and it's a different algorithm. And you're trying to create an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4934.2s	4934.2	 abstraction that may not necessarily be natural for the evolution of the product set of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4938.1s	4938.1	 company. I would much rather see them figure it out. That's not a good argument. Again, if you were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4942.8s	4942.8	 not a monopoly, I would be more sympathetic, but because somebody's feelings would get hurt,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4948.5s	4948.5	 a product manager's feelings will get hurt instead of Google. It's not the reason to not protect free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4953.4s	4953.4	 speech rights. I'm saying you're unnaturally disrupting the product evolution. Tough luck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4957.5s	4957.5	 That's what happens when you're worth $2 trillion. And when you impact a billion people on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4962.1s	4962.1	 planet, when you start having massive impact in society, you have to take some responsibility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4967.4s	4967.4	 Those companies are not taking responsibility. If you're not super, super, super successful,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4971.8s	4971.8	 this is not going to affect you. So you don't have nothing to worry about. You'll see apps offshore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4976.4s	4976.4	 and you'll see TikTok and other things compete because they'll have a better product experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4980.2s	4980.2	 Nobody's going to create a new Google because they're downranking 1% to 10% of the search
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4988.2s	4988.2	 results for political reasons. Some accountability. Hold on. In an ideal world, companies like Google
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4994.0s	4994.0	 and so forth would not take sides in political debates to be politically neutral, but they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=4997.5s	4997.5	 not. You look at all the data around the political leanings of the people running these companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=5001.7s	5001.7	 and then you look at the actual actions of these companies, and they have become fully political,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=5005.9s	5005.9	 and they've waded into all these political debates with the result that the American

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=5014.6s	5014.6	 which are just engaging in retaliation, basically financial retaliation purely based on what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JTcxIVlQfU&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=23&t=5021.3s	5021.3	 political viewpoints they have. Why? It's not like PayPal needs to be in the business of
