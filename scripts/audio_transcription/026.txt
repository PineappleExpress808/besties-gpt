https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=372.6s	372.6	 done a lot of kind of leading work on on basically calling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=377.6s	377.6	 aging a disease and life extension. So the book
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=380.4s	380.4	 Lifespan highlights I think a lot of his research and findings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=383.9s	383.9	 and paths forward for for improving longevity. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=390.6s	390.6	 basically, you know, comes down to what he defines as kind of an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=394.4s	394.4	 early switch that evolved in evolutionary biology, in every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=398.2s	398.2	 cell on every living organism where the cell is either in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=401.2s	401.2	 growth mode or repair mode. And the trick is can you get the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=404.3s	404.3	 gene to switch on that puts the cell into repair mode. And if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=408.2s	408.2	 you do that, the cell fixes itself and you and the cell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=411.6s	411.6	 lasts longer, the organism lives longer. And so they've identified
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=415.3s	415.3	 a number of genes that trigger this and a number of compounds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=418.4s	418.4	 that trigger expression of those genes. And there's a number
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=421.8s	421.8	 of things you can do lifestyle wise to trigger these genes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=424.6s	424.6	 basically to get yourself to live longer. So fasting is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=427.0s	427.0	 good one. And then there's a bunch of compounds that you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=429.5s	429.5	 take that mimic fasting on a cellular level, like metformin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=433.6s	433.6	 and rapamycin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=435.0s	435.0	 I'm on metformin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=436.0s	436.0	 I think a couple of you guys are on metformin, right? Yeah. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=438.3s	438.3	 then and then the NAD plus supplements, which you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=441.4s	441.4	 buy us you say M n m n subs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=443.9s	443.9	 Yeah, and then and then and NAD plus. So there's two there's two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=447.6s	447.6	 compounds N m n like Nancy, Mike Nancy, and then an R. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=454.4s	454.4	 those you can buy a product called true nitrogen on Amazon,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=457.2s	457.2	 which which has those compounds and you take about 1000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=459.8s	459.8	 milligrams a day. And anyway, all of this stuff's laid out in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=463.2s	463.2	 his books, and it supports a lot of the research that's being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=465.6s	465.6	 done, obviously fasting and exercise also trigger this gene
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=468.7s	468.7	 expression and enable kind of measures of longevity to kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=473.3s	473.3	 be showing up biologically. But I think I think it's a it's an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=476.6s	476.6	 emerging field, and there's a lot of deep work going on. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=480.1s	480.1	 as people have highlighted, the process of aging is a biological
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=483.5s	483.5	 process that theoretically, we can stop and potentially reverse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=486.9s	486.9	 And there's a lot of new work that's being done in stem cell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=489.6s	489.6	 therapy that may kind of elicit some new paths forward here. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=493.4s	493.4	 arguably, someone is alive on planet Earth today that could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=495.8s	495.8	 live past the age of 200. So it's an exciting field and lots
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=500.1s	500.1	 of kind of paths forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=501.8s	501.8	 I'll, I'll tell you for what it's worth my regimen. And God,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=507.4s	507.4	 here we go. Thirst trap photo coming in. No. So, so I do the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=515.1s	515.1	 following. So I take a statin now, it was 10 milligrams, now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=522.3s	522.3	 I'm at 20 milligrams. I take metformin. And all of this I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=526.8s	526.8	 take sort of in a preventative posture, because my cholesterol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=531.2s	531.2	 wasn't super high, but it wasn't super low is like sort of like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=534.0s	534.0	 in the 160 170 180. But now it's sort of like 120. And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=539.6s	539.6	 metformin I take preventatively as well. I'm not pre diabetic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=544.3s	544.3	 And then a couple of vitamin D and some other stuff. But then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=546.6s	546.6	 here are these things that I do that I think could be valuable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=548.8s	548.8	 for some folks listening. There are these places now that exist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=554.2s	554.2	 are popping up one company that you can check out is called pre
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=558.4s	558.4	 nouveau P R E N U V O. They're in Vancouver, they're in LA,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=564.8s	564.8	 they're in Redwood City, so Mid Peninsula for those in Silicon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=568.2s	568.2	 Valley. And what you can do is you can get a head to toe MRI.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=573.7s	573.7	 So, you know, there's no radiation, you know, you could do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=576.4s	576.4	 these things, you know, every other week, if you wanted to, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=578.9s	578.9	 takes about an hour. And what happens is they can basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=583.0s	583.0	 look through your entire body, your musculature, your organs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=588.7s	588.7	 from the literally from the tip of your head all the way down to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=591.5s	591.5	 your ankles, and they can spot a lot of stuff that may not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=595.0s	595.0	 otherwise be seen. And so, you know, every three or four years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=598.7s	598.7	 to get one of these scans, you could see a lesion, you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=602.0s	602.0	 see the beginnings of a tumor. You know, I did one a few weeks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=605.6s	605.6	 ago, touchwood, it was great, nothing, nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=607.8s	607.8	 So much does it cost?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=610.0s	610.0	 There's a range of prices. And I think those prices will come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=613.5s	613.5	 down the range of prices are from like 1500 to $2,500. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=617.3s	617.3	 it's not expensive. It's not cheap, sorry. But here's what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=621.2s	621.2	 they're able to do. They're building a corpus of all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=623.5s	623.5	 images where they're running machine learning on it, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=626.8s	626.8	 they're getting better at identifying anomalies. And so as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=631.0s	631.0	 a result of that, they're able to actually take the MRI images
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=633.4s	633.4	 and they can do fewer and fewer scans to get the equivalent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=636.9s	636.9	 resolution. So two things will happen. One is the scan time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=639.6s	639.6	 will come down, right? So it was an hour and a half. Now it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=643.0s	643.0	 sort of right under an hour. It can probably be as low as 40
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=646.3s	646.3	 minutes, which is relatively tolerable for most people. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=649.6s	649.6	 then the cost will come down into the hundreds of dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=652.1s	652.1	 because you'll be able to very rapidly assess. So I do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=656.4s	656.4	 And then the second thing is for anybody with heart disease in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=658.8s	658.8	 their family, I really implore you, one of my friends actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=661.9s	661.9	 is flying down from Toronto, I'm taking him to my cardiologist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=665.2s	665.2	 in LA. And there's a thing called heart flow. And what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=669.0s	669.0	 heart flow is, is a contrast CT, which basically means they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=672.2s	672.2	 inject a dye, and then they put you under a CT and they, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=676.4s	676.4	 map out your heart. And you can literally see the calcium build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=680.0s	680.0	 up, you can see the state of your arteries. And, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=683.6s	683.6	 what probably people don't know is when you have a calcium
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=685.7s	685.7	 score, you know, most of us at zero, but when it starts to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=688.9s	688.9	 non zero, it doubles every year. And by the time it gets into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=692.4s	692.4	 the 1000s, you're basically guaranteed to get some form of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=695.1s	695.1	 cardiac issue. And so it doesn't seem like anything if your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=699.1s	699.1	 cardiac score is 20, except it goes to 4080 160. And all of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=703.2s	703.2	 sudden, within five, six years, you're really in the red zone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=705.4s	705.4	 for a heart attack or something. I've done it twice now. Every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=709.2s	709.2	 five years, I do it in touchwood, you know, my, my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=712.2s	712.2	 calcium score is still zero. But in any event, that's what I do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=716.2s	716.2	 for longevity, I kind of preventatively at the cellular
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=718.8s	718.8	 level with some drugs, and then just trying to catch cancer and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=722.5s	722.5	 heart disease on the front end. Otherwise, eat three balanced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=726.4s	726.4	 meals and exercise and sleep a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=728.0s	728.0	 Sax, you obviously don't care about longevity. Any thoughts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=733.4s	733.4	 here? I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=733.9s	733.9	 Sax has looked like he's 1000 years old since he was seven.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=736.8s	736.8	 No, he was when he was in 12th grade, he looked like he was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=739.5s	739.5	 vice president United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=740.7s	740.7	 Yeah, guys, just just just let just let me know when this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=744.8s	744.8	 conversation is over. I've been doing my email.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=750.7s	750.7	 Sax is like end my life now. I fucking hate it. You don't you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=755.8s	755.8	 guys like I just lost two years right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=758.3s	758.3	 Sax has got an early spot both on the rocket ship to Mars. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=764.2s	764.2	 he's got an inside VIP to Peter Thiel's blood boy project. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=768.4s	768.4	 so either way, he's getting off the planet, or he's going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=771.4s	771.4	 refresh his blood or both. So he's good. All right, action
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=775.7s	775.7	 bias asks, please debate decentralization of monetary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=779.4s	779.4	 value, ultimate threat for insiders power erosion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=783.8s	783.8	 I interpret this as a as a Bitcoin question. So yeah, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=787.7s	787.7	 think one of the most interesting things happening in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=790.9s	790.9	 the world today is this is what's happening with Bitcoin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=794.8s	794.8	 right? It's and you're seeing the price go up because a bunch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=797.7s	797.7	 of institutional investors on Wall Street are all getting into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=799.8s	799.8	 it. Now, it's gone from retail to institutional. And the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=803.9s	803.9	 narrative, basically, it's a really profound narrative, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=807.2s	807.2	 is it's the separation of money and state. So if you think about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=811.8s	811.8	 like one of the most important events in human history was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=814.9s	814.9	 separation of church and state, where we no longer look to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=817.9s	817.9	 state to determine, you know, what religion everyone is going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=821.2s	821.2	 to be. Well, what crypto is introducing is this idea that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=824.9s	824.9	 the government cannot control the money supply. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=827.4s	827.4	 that's what he's talking about with the decentralization is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=830.0s	830.0	 that you could have a currency that everybody in the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=833.1s	833.1	 believes in that no government can control. That's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=836.4s	836.4	 separation of money and state. Now, this is just really a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=839.7s	839.7	 narrative right now. I mean, and who knows if it will actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=844.0s	844.0	 come true. But the interesting thing is that if everybody does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=847.4s	847.4	 believe in it, it will come true. And so Bitcoin has been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=851.2s	851.2	 sort of described as the bubble that never ends because if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=853.9s	853.9	 everyone kind of buys into this bubble, it actually comes true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=857.3s	857.3	 So I think it's very interesting and you're seeing because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=861.9s	861.9	 Bitcoin is kind of perceived as the antidote to inflation and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=867.5s	867.5	 money printing by the government. I think you're seeing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=870.8s	870.8	 it take on new urgency now because the government just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=873.2s	873.2	 keeps printing trillions and trillions of dollars of of new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=876.4s	876.4	 money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=876.9s	876.9	 Doesn't this threaten government so if government doesn't have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=880.0s	880.0	 control over monitoring financial transactions and have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=883.2s	883.2	 control over the accounts in which the financial assets sit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=886.3s	886.3	 which is effectively the notion of decentralized anonymized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=889.4s	889.4	 wallets, then how does the government secure taxation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=893.8s	893.8	 which is requisite for their ability to fund? Well, the good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=897.0s	897.0	 the fund the state right and so what happens to the state?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=899.6s	899.6	 Well, so there's an enormous amount of leakage that happens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=902.4s	902.4	 today in assets that actually get financialized, but in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=905.9s	905.9	 gray market. And I think the the beautiful thing is on the one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=909.0s	909.0	 hand, you know, we become less focused on like the M one and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=912.4s	912.4	 the M two money supply like the physical printable,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=915.1s	915.1	 distributable money that we can see and touch. And it gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=918.2s	918.2	 replaced with virtual currencies that are tied to other things. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=921.4s	921.4	 think what the the the person who wrote the question is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=924.2s	924.2	 asking really is more about DeFi and what's happening sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=928.0s	928.0	 like on the Ethereum, you know, 2.0 ERC 20 contracts, all that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=931.5s	931.5	 stuff, which is sort of much more next gen, I think, than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=934.8s	934.8	 Bitcoin. And I think at some point, we should deep dive into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=937.4s	937.4	 it. But what I would say Friedberg is all the leakage you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=940.0s	940.0	 have today goes away in a world of DeFi, because you will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=944.0s	944.0	 financialize every single asset possible. You know, you'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=948.0s	948.0	 financialize your homes, you'll financialize your cars, your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=950.8s	950.8	 watches, your jewelry, your art, you'll financialize every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=953.9s	953.9	 random thing, maybe even your career, and how people will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=957.0s	957.0	 trade it absolutely your career. And and the thing is by by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=960.4s	960.4	 monetizing it, and financializing it, you can borrow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=963.4s	963.4	 against it, you can trade it, you can pull forward value into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=966.5s	966.5	 the future against it, but it'll all be tracked. And so as long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=970.4s	970.4	 as a government then says, listen, we're going to enable it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=973.2s	973.2	 all, but there needs to be an off ramp to taxation. And that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=977.6s	977.6	 pretty simple, because a physical house exists in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=980.1s	980.1	 world, you can't hide the existence of a physical house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=982.7s	982.7	 But it's not anonymized, right, Shemop? And so I, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=986.0s	986.0	 I mean, that's the challenge is if no, I'm saying if it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=988.7s	988.7	 anonymized, then the government can't track it and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=991.1s	991.1	 government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=992.1s	992.1	 These are these are two separate things, some assets will live
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=995.2s	995.2	 anonymously. And those are the assets that don't need to exist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=999.1s	999.1	 in the real world. But I think what this will create is a world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1002.3s	1002.3	 where all of these assets that actually really exists in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1004.7s	1004.7	 real world, it'll be fine that it exists and that people get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1008.1s	1008.1	 taxed on it, but it'll be much more legitimate. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1011.3s	1011.3	 it'll be simpler. And so I think people will trade off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1013.8s	1013.8	 incremental taxation for incremental monetize ability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1017.4s	1017.4	 I'll give you an example. Let's use real estate. There is no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1021.6s	1021.6	 reason why every single piece of land everywhere around the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1026.2s	1026.2	 world isn't written into a ledger with knowledge of who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1031.2s	1031.2	 owns it, such that the person that owns it could trade it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1035.3s	1035.3	 could borrow against it, could sell it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1039.0s	1039.0	 fractionalize it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1040.3s	1040.3	 fractionalize it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1041.2s	1041.2	 even if you can't fractionalize in the real world, because your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1043.2s	1043.2	 neighbors won't let you set it up into four lots, you could do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1045.9s	1045.9	 that online,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1046.6s	1046.6	 online. And so today, what will happen is that, you know, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1049.8s	1049.8	 person has a level of wealth. And what they do instead take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1054.0s	1054.0	 the United States is they'd lobby lobby lobby to create all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1056.6s	1056.6	 this convoluted real estate tax law to make their life simpler.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1060.6s	1060.6	 But if you actually unlocked the ability to focus on revenue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1063.9s	1063.9	 versus expenses, you just wouldn't focus as much on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1066.7s	1066.7	 taxation, because you'd say, well, I can make so much more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1068.5s	1068.5	 money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1070.1s	1070.1	 If you judge just a, you know, sort of answer the question here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1073.3s	1073.3	 from the from the reader from the listener, I think you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1076.2s	1076.2	 really judge this based upon how much it's being pumped by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1079.3s	1079.3	 people who own it. And they are absolutely dogged religious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1083.7s	1083.7	 about this. It's like talking to and, you know, person who's, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1087.2s	1087.2	 know, met Jesus, and now everybody has to be a Christian.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1090.4s	1090.4	 And you can also look at the people who are opposing it. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1093.5s	1093.5	 don't know if you saw Yellen. And then Christine Lagarde, she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1098.8s	1098.8	 came out against it, Yellen's come out against it, India might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1101.6s	1101.6	 ban it. And then you have obviously China's coming out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1104.0s	1104.0	 their digital one. So I think it's going to be there's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1107.2s	1107.2	 to be a dogfight here, where governments are not going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1110.0s	1110.0	 easily give up their control of this. And there's many ways they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1114.8s	1114.8	 can make a bunch of red tape to slow this down. And in countries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1118.8s	1118.8	 that are authoritarian, they can outright ban it. Let's take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1121.0s	1121.0	 another question here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1121.8s	1121.8	 By the way, there's like three outcomes here, right? I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1123.6s	1123.6	 you can either see Bitcoin, for example, you know, being banned,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1127.4s	1127.4	 and that's going to be ugly. And obviously, there would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1130.9s	1130.9	 significant financial loss at this point. To Sachs's point, at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1134.0s	1134.0	 some point, there's so much asset value tied up in Bitcoin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1136.7s	1136.7	 it's too big to fail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1138.4s	1138.4	 Sorry, David, banned by who?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1140.2s	1140.2	 Oh, that's Chinese government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1142.0s	1142.0	 This is what they're trying to do on some of the states, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1144.4s	1144.4	 And they're trying to make it illegal for citizens to transfer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1146.8s	1146.8	 money in and out of the asset class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1148.8s	1148.8	 I think it's a bigger threat to countries that want to impose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1152.0s	1152.0	 export or currency controls and export restrictions. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1157.2s	1157.2	 frankly, if you're a country that's not afraid of currency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1160.3s	1160.3	 movements, because you're not trying to do something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1161.7s	1161.7	 oppressive to your people, I don't think you have that much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1163.9s	1163.9	 to fear here. I mean, there are other ways of trying to hide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1167.0s	1167.0	 assets or hide money besides Bitcoin and every transaction,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1170.8s	1170.8	 every Bitcoin transaction is written into the ledger. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1173.6s	1173.6	 you have to be pretty dumb to try and commit a crime with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1176.0s	1176.0	 Bitcoin, because there's going to be a permanent record in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1178.3s	1178.3	 blockchain forever of that transfer. And then there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1181.1s	1181.1	 companies that provide that do kind of sleuthing and try to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1186.6s	1186.6	 you know, unravel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1188.5s	1188.5	 You think tax evasion in the United States is going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1190.7s	1190.7	 difficult with Bitcoin? If I accrue a bunch of value in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1194.4s	1194.4	 Bitcoin, am I going to be able to evade paying taxes on those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1197.3s	1197.3	 gains and convert that Bitcoin into physical assets by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1199.8s	1199.8	 purchasing it from another Bitcoin wallet holder? I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1203.6s	1203.6	 how realistic is tax evasion going to be? And how much would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1207.2s	1207.2	 because that's ultimately what the US government would mostly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1209.2s	1209.2	 Well, so you would convert cash into Bitcoin, and then you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1212.2s	1212.2	 to sell your Bitcoin at some point, you're gonna have to sell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1214.7s	1214.7	 I mean, there would be a there'd be a realization of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1218.4s	1218.4	 what I'm saying transfer to a seller of an asset of another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1221.6s	1221.6	 asset that's willing to accept Bitcoin in receipt and so to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1224.8s	1224.8	 anonymize wallets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1225.8s	1225.8	 I don't know. I mean, that that transaction is going to live on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1228.3s	1228.3	 the blockchain forever. And it's going to live in the books of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1230.9s	1230.9	 whoever the seller is, what are they selling you a car or a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1233.3s	1233.3	 house, whatever? I mean, that transit, a watch. I mean, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1237.5s	1237.5	 if it's a personal item, maybe but if we're talking about a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1239.8s	1239.8	 substantial asset, like a house or a company or something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1244.1s	1244.1	 they're going to need to the other side of the transactions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1246.4s	1246.4	 going to need to report the realization event. So you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1249.5s	1249.5	 gonna have to have two people collude to engage in tax evasion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1252.8s	1252.8	 like seems like a really stupid thing to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1254.9s	1254.9	 Legally incorporated businesses are going to be mandated to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1258.1s	1258.1	 effectively identity verification much like we have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1260.4s	1260.4	 do under the Patriot Act with all the financial law.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1263.2s	1263.2	 Totally, totally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1264.4s	1264.4	 Know your buyer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1265.0s	1265.0	 Yeah, ultimately how the compromise arises, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1267.4s	1267.4	 Yeah, I'm not I'm not that worried about I feel like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1270.5s	1270.5	 whole like Silk Road type Bitcoin will be used illegally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1274.5s	1274.5	 thing is like kind of a old meme about it that I think that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1279.2s	1279.2	 fears are like greatly exaggerated. But the thing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1282.2s	1282.2	 jumps out at me about all the critics of Bitcoin, and I'm not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1285.4s	1285.4	 like a pumper, whatever, but I do I do own some is the thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1290.0s	1290.0	 that like all these like critics don't seem to understand is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1292.9s	1292.9	 technology. That's the common denominator, whether it's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1295.8s	1295.8	 Howard Marks or Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger, whoever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1298.6s	1298.6	 they're all like great investors or whatever, but they're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1300.8s	1300.8	 technologists and blind spot. It's a blind spot. And the thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1304.1s	1304.1	 they don't understand about the technology is that Bitcoin is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1307.2s	1307.2	 the first digital asset to ever be created that you can't create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1310.9s	1310.9	 infinite copies of, right? So think about like a song, or a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1315.7s	1315.7	 photo or a video, or anything that's digital. You've always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1319.8s	1319.8	 been able to make an infinite number of copies. Isn't that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1321.7s	1321.7	 what the word digital means is that it's infinitely copyable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1324.7s	1324.7	 So how do you have digital money that can't just be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1328.0s	1328.0	 infinitely copied? Obviously, that would destroy the value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1330.5s	1330.5	 And that was the genius of Bitcoin is that every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1333.6s	1333.6	 transaction is written into this ledger, the blockchain is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1336.8s	1336.8	 decentralized. And nobody over the last decade or so has figured
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1340.4s	1340.4	 out how to counterfeit Bitcoin, how to make a duplicate, how to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1344.4s	1344.4	 double spend Bitcoin. As long as that remains true, then Bitcoin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1350.1s	1350.1	 can serve as money if everyone believes in it. The day that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1353.9s	1353.9	 someone figures out how to counterfeit a Bitcoin, how to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1356.5s	1356.5	 double spend it, it's all worthless. But a lot of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1359.7s	1359.7	 have been trying over the last 10 years, they've never figured
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1361.8s	1361.8	 out how to crack it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1362.5s	1362.5	 By the way, that's a great it's a great transition to the next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1364.6s	1364.6	 question. Sorry, I don't want to interrupt here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1366.7s	1366.7	 No, it's a perfect transition. And next up, Adil says, can one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1371.8s	1371.8	 of the besties explain the power of quantum computing and how it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1375.0s	1375.0	 can change industries like medical, pharmaceuticals, any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1377.8s	1377.8	 good companies that are leaders in quantum computing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1380.6s	1380.6	 I'll take a cut at this one. So and the reason I pointed it out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1386.2s	1386.2	 is because a lot of people do talk about quantum computing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1389.6s	1389.6	 potentially being a path to cracking the hashing functions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1394.0s	1394.0	 in Bitcoin mining and potentially overwhelming the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1396.5s	1396.5	 network and effectively counterfeiting the Bitcoin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1400.3s	1400.3	 ledger. And so technically, a quantum computer is a computer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1406.2s	1406.2	 that uses qubits, which is a storage of a quantum state versus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1411.4s	1411.4	 a storage of a binary state, which is a binary binary digit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1416.0s	1416.0	 which is called a bit in traditional computing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1419.0s	1419.0	 classical computing, a one and a zero, a one and a zero and a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1422.2s	1422.2	 quantum or qubit, a quantum state can be a much more dynamic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1426.2s	1426.2	 function. And so it's a it's a state that is very analog and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1430.4s	1430.4	 very representative of kind of a much more kind of broader
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1433.6s	1433.6	 condition than just a one or a zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1435.6s	1435.6	 It could be a one or zero or neither, right? It can have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1438.4s	1438.4	 neither state as well about it as a wave function. And and so a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1442.8s	1442.8	 qubit can only exist in a piece of matter, where you can hold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1447.2s	1447.2	 the fidelity of a quantum state meaning it can't be disturbed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1450.6s	1450.6	 So right now, all quantum computing gets disturbed, it all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1454.2s	1454.2	 has some error prone context to it. And so in order to use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1458.3s	1458.3	 qubits to do calculations, we use what's called quantum error
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1461.7s	1461.7	 correction on those qubits. And so we adjust the qubits and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1465.0s	1465.0	 output to try and resolve it. A qubit with no errors is called
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1470.8s	1470.8	 a logical qubit. And a logical qubit has not been built, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1474.8s	1474.8	 would require very, very, very low error rates. And there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1478.2s	1478.2	 bunch of and there's a bunch of theories around when this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1480.9s	1480.9	 going to happen. When are we going to have truly logical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1483.0s	1483.0	 qubits? When does the error rate get low enough that these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1485.9s	1485.9	 qubits are truly kind of useful. Now, there is an estimate that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1490.4s	1490.4	 number of logical qubits needed to crack RSA 2048, which is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1496.2s	1496.2	 big kind of encryption standard, which could kind of break the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1500.1s	1500.1	 whole cryptocurrency model. It would require about 4,011
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1506.1s	1506.1	 logical qubits. Today, the largest, the largest quantum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1511.2s	1511.2	 computer has about 100 qubits that are very noisy. And so it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1514.6s	1514.6	 less than one logical qubit. And so we would need somewhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1518.4s	1518.4	 between 100,000 and a million qubit computer to be able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1522.5s	1522.5	 have enough quantum supremacy to be able to tackle a project like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1527.1s	1527.1	 cracking RSA 2048. And by some estimates, and some people have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1531.2s	1531.2	 tried to estimate when this would happen. And the estimate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1533.4s	1533.4	 currently by some researchers is that this there's a less than 5%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1536.9s	1536.9	 chance this happens before the year 2040. So we're talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1540.0s	1540.0	 somewhere between the year 2040 and the 2060. When we get a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1543.7s	1543.7	 quantum computer that has enough logical qubits to be able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1546.8s	1546.8	 crack a problem, like, you know, RSA 2048, and basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1551.4s	1551.4	 make all crypto fail. And between now and then a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1554.0s	1554.0	 people are working on quantum cryptography, which is new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1556.3s	1556.3	 methods of encryption that are kind of built for the quantum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1559.4s	1559.4	 era and the quantum frontier. Now, what's more interesting is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1562.2s	1562.2	 that over the next 100 next 10 years or so, the current super
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1565.5s	1565.5	 noisy, super low fidelity quantum computers can be used to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1569.2s	1569.2	 simulate quantum states, which is the condition of atoms and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1572.4s	1572.4	 molecules, and use that to do better modeling of physio
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1576.1s	1576.1	 chemical properties of material. That's where the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1578.7s	1578.7	 breakthroughs will happen in the next decade. So all the hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1581.0s	1581.0	 discrete problems that we kind of theorize about cryptography
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1583.7s	1583.7	 and other stuff, that's decades away. This decade, we are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1587.0s	1587.0	 already going to start to see quantum computers have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1589.1s	1589.1	 breakthroughs in how material how atoms and molecules
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1591.8s	1591.8	 interact with each other. For example, finding proteins that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1594.7s	1594.7	 can do a better job of having an enzymatic reaction in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1598.0s	1598.0	 physical world, where we can now potentially pull nitrogen out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1601.0s	1601.0	 the atmosphere to make fertilizer or drugs or, or specific
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1606.6s	1606.6	 protein targets that can go in the human body and have specific
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1608.9s	1608.9	 functions by modeling what we can't do with traditional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1611.4s	1611.4	 computers today, modeling the quantum properties of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1614.0s	1614.0	 molecules and how they interact with other molecules, and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1616.6s	1616.6	 building really cool predictive models that we can then turn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1619.0s	1619.0	 into products. And that's going to be chased really hard this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1621.8s	1621.8	 decade, everyone's going to be going after it. And we already
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1624.9s	1624.9	 have enough compute power, I don't think that there's any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1626.7s	1626.7	 leader in quantum computing today, these are all still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1628.6s	1628.6	 science experiments, they're all breadboards, IBM, Google,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1631.8s	1631.8	 Microsoft, a bunch of research labs, a bunch of startups are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1634.8s	1634.8	 all kind of basically doing the same thing with different types
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1637.2s	1637.2	 of qubit technology, but they all have very high errors. They
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1640.1s	1640.1	 all have very low qubit computers. And so it's still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1643.0s	1643.0	 unresolved, who's going to come out with something useful?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1645.2s	1645.2	 Two companies to follow are D wave, which was started in 99.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1649.8s	1649.8	 So just to give you an idea of how long people have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1651.6s	1651.6	 working on this 22 year old company, I know, Steve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1654.5s	1654.5	 Jervitsen has been backing it for now in its third decade. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1657.6s	1657.6	 then ionic, is that the other one I o n q? I think like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1662.1s	1662.1	 quantum facts, right? quantum computing is like fusion. Yes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1666.4s	1666.4	 it's like, it's like a technical problem that has attracted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1669.2s	1669.2	 people who've had more money than common sense. And it just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1674.9s	1674.9	 basically a way to burn an enormous amount of money over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1677.7s	1677.7	 20 or 30 years. And the problem with that is that you start to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1681.2s	1681.2	 build in technical cruft, anything that is still in R&D
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1685.0s	1685.0	 phase 20 years in needs to get scrapped and rebuilt from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1687.7s	1687.7	 scratch, because everything has changed, including the people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1690.8s	1690.8	 even the 20 year olds that started are now in their 40s and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1693.5s	1693.5	 have kids and just have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1694.5s	1694.5	 comparative risk. It's a great point, Shomat. And so, and so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1698.2s	1698.2	 like, you got to just scrap these projects and start all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1700.4s	1700.4	 over again, because the problem is you need somebody completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1703.4s	1703.4	 naive to look at this problem in 2021. And say, well, okay, how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1707.3s	1707.3	 are we actually going to really solve like, the coherence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1710.4s	1710.4	 problem? I don't know, how are we going to build a Gatorade? I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1713.3s	1713.3	 don't know. And you have these very formulaic ways that we knew
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1718.6s	1718.6	 based on what technologies were available in 99 or 2000, to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1722.6s	1722.6	 start with. And I think that's probably part of why we framed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1726.3s	1726.3	 the problem as largely sort of this thing of like, okay, maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1729.6s	1729.6	 there's like a integer factorization thing you can do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1732.3s	1732.3	 And it's like, I don't know, I'm, I'm deeply skeptical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1735.9s	1735.9	 Yeah, well, I agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1737.8s	1737.8	 By the way, this is why, so can I just say one last thing? This
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1740.3s	1740.3	 is why Alpha Fold beat quantum computers to the solution of

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1750.8s	1750.8	 just take a different run at it completely different people, a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1769.3s	1769.3	 What I was going to say is that the main thing I was thinking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1771.6s	1771.6	 about while you're giving that dissertation on qubits, or God

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1801.2s	1801.2	 Exactly what they said about AI and then now it's infected in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1804.7s	1804.7	 every company. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1805.6s	1805.6	 that's not true, Jason, because there was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1807.2s	1807.2	 They were saying this about AI 10 years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1809.3s	1809.3	 No, Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1809.8s	1809.8	 D-Mine couldn't get funded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1810.5s	1810.5	 I completely disagree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1811.8s	1811.8	 D-Mine could not get funded in the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1813.6s	1813.6	 No, completely disagree with you because there was a practical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1817.9s	1817.9	 commercial revenue generating opportunity for AI and machine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1821.5s	1821.5	 learning, literally from the start of computing. It took
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1825.0s	1825.0	 several iterations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1826.1s	1826.1	 There's no use case for fusion energy. I mean, of course there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1829.3s	1829.3	 is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1829.5s	1829.5	 No, I'm not saying that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1830.1s	1830.1	 No, but it's still at the basic R&D stage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1832.4s	1832.4	 It's still basic R&D.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1833.6s	1833.6	 Yeah, I will partially agree with you, Jason, in the sense that I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1836.3s	1836.3	 was not investing in AI 10 years ago because I thought at that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1839.4s	1839.4	 stage it was still in the realm of science fiction. But we just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1842.8s	1842.8	 announced two deals in the last two days, two seed deals, Viable,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1845.8s	1845.8	 which is basically an AI voice to the customer. It slurps in all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1849.0s	1849.0	 of your customer feedback and then gives you answers. And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1852.5s	1852.5	 the other one is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1853.6s	1853.6	 The copywriting one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1855.0s	1855.0	 It's the copywriting AI called copy.ai, which literally writes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1859.3s	1859.3	 your site copy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1859.7s	1859.7	 Trying to get a slice right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1860.9s	1860.9	 Yeah, we might give you a slice, Jason. Stop being so skeptical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1864.9s	1864.9	 But here's what's changed, right? These are seed companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1873.3s	1873.3	 with just a handful of employees. They're built on GPT-3.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1876.8s	1876.8	 So you had this basic R&D done. It creates this platform called
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1882.1s	1882.1	 GPT-3.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1883.1s	1883.1	 It's like AWS, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1885.1s	1885.1	 You can now build companies on top of that. So, I mean, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1889.7s	1889.7	 what I invest in are the commercialization of new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1893.6s	1893.6	 technology waves. Those technology waves happen because of deeper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1897.8s	1897.8	 R&D.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1898.2s	1898.2	 What do you think about VR and AR? Because there's the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1900.8s	1900.8	 conversation with VR and AR. Are these worthy investments or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1903.9s	1903.9	 not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1904.1s	1904.1	 I think Sachs's point is such a good one because what he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1907.3s	1907.3	 saying is what I think has happened over the last century.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1911.6s	1911.6	 The government, the best role the government can provide is to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1914.8s	1914.8	 take on that technology risk, that large capital-intensive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1918.0s	1918.0	 technology risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1918.8s	1918.8	 This was the case with the Manhattan Project, and we got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1921.2s	1921.2	 nuclear energy out of it. It was the case with Apollo Project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1924.1s	1924.1	 We have the space industry as a result now, and it's what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1927.0s	1927.0	 happened with the Human Genome Project, and now we have an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1929.2s	1929.2	 incredible genomics revolution and ARPANET.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1932.4s	1932.4	 And that expensive early-stage de-risking requires an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1936.0s	1936.0	 incredible amount of capital that's very low returning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1938.8s	1938.8	 It doesn't return anything. What Sachs is saying later is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1942.1s	1942.1	 commercialization where-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1943.2s	1943.2	 Do we have a heuristic, a theory, a best practice around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1947.6s	1947.6	 when something goes from a research project to being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1950.8s	1950.8	 commercially viable? Are there signals?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1954.4s	1954.4	 Platformification seems like one that you pointed out, David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1957.6s	1957.6	 If it's a platform and you can use it easily, that's one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1960.3s	1960.3	 Yeah. I think you can tell when the amount of capital required
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1964.4s	1964.4	 to get it off the ground goes to something reasonable, like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1967.6s	1967.6	 few million dollars as opposed to hundreds of millions of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1969.7s	1969.7	 dollars. And Jason, you've talked about this, that any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1972.8s	1972.8	 company that's trying to raise hundreds of millions of dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1975.7s	1975.7	 or has a billion dollar plus valuation before shipping a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1980.5s	1980.5	 product is presumptively fraud. There's still too much R&D
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1984.7s	1984.7	 involved. I mean, look, venture capital is a milestone-based
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1989.8s	1989.8	 investing model. You take a little bit of seed money, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1992.6s	1992.6	 create a prototype, you get some proof, then you raise a series A,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1995.7s	1995.7	 you get 10 million, you get some customers, then you raise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=1998.6s	1998.6	 25 million and you scale the company. And it's based on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2001.6s	2001.6	 milestones. It's actually a very efficient way of investing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2004.4s	2004.4	 And when somebody wants to skip over all those milestones, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2007.3s	2007.3	 say, no, we need hundreds of millions of dollars to launch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2009.7s	2009.7	 this thing. You have to ask why is this idea really ready for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2014.0s	2014.0	 commercialization?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2015.1s	2015.1	 What's Chamath's response to that? Because Chamath, you've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2017.2s	2017.2	 done deep tech investing and you've done-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2018.7s	2018.7	 I mean, Virgin Galactic would fall into that or no? Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2021.9s	2021.9	 So how do you think about deep tech investing, Chamath, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2024.3s	2024.3	 where there's a role for venture capital, private market dollars?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2028.8s	2028.8	 Yeah, I've done a lot of deep tech investing. And my whole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2031.2s	2031.2	 thing was I've always looked at the point where something is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2035.3s	2035.3	 completely de-risked, technically, and it's about then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2039.3s	2039.3	 the exploitation of a market. Otherwise, it's exactly what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2043.2s	2043.2	 David said. So I'll give you an example. A company called
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2045.8s	2045.8	 Relativity Space is now the second most valuable private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2049.0s	2049.0	 space flight company after SpaceX. YC Company, I led the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2052.3s	2052.3	 series A. What were they trying to do? Their stated goal at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2057.2s	2057.2	 time was we want to 3D print the entire rocket and the entire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2063.2s	2063.2	 engine. And I said, wow, okay, well, when we did the math and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2067.5s	2067.5	 we tried to figure this out and have the same launch capability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2069.9s	2069.9	 as SpaceX, all of it comes down to, okay, well, how do you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2073.8s	2073.8	 want to de-risk this? And what Tim and Jordan's first idea was,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2078.0s	2078.0	 well, first, we want to basically prove that we can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2080.8s	2080.8	 actually get a certain printing capability done because you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2084.0s	2084.0	 talking about these extremely, you know, energy intensive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2088.0s	2088.0	 extremely technical printers and effectively writing printer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2091.1s	2091.1	 drivers, right? And to be doing it at a scale where you can hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2095.2s	2095.2	 that off to NASA, and they can take that engine, literally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2099.6s	2099.6	 strap it down with chains called the hold down test, fire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2102.5s	2102.5	 the engine and say it works. Doesn't blow up. Doesn't blow up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2107.3s	2107.3	 And I said to Tim, how much does that take? And Tim was like, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2109.8s	2109.8	 can probably do that on 10 million bucks. I said, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2112.0s	2112.0	 done on $10 million. Yeah. And so it was 100 million. 100. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2116.8s	2116.8	 only person that would have written $100 million check to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2119.5s	2119.5	 de-risk that doesn't understand what they're trying to prove at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2122.7s	2122.7	 that point in time. Because what he was trying to prove was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2126.4s	2126.4	 ability to use the printer. He wasn't saying I'm trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2130.1s	2130.1	 build a next generation rocket motor. Right? So similarly with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2135.5s	2135.5	 Virgin, you know, Virgin got to a point where it's like, it had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2138.2s	2138.2	 flown demonstrably in the air. So what did it prove? It proved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2142.0s	2142.0	 the flight profile worked. It proved the engine work. It
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2145.4s	2145.4	 proved all the navigational componentry work and approved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2148.3s	2148.3	 the safety envelope work, which means that it could basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2150.7s	2150.7	 act as a glider under all kinds of boundary conditions. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2155.8s	2155.8	 an enormous amount of technical progress. And then at that point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2158.5s	2158.5	 there I'm willing to invest billions of dollars. And so to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2161.2s	2161.2	 David's point, you have to have a new model early too. Like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2164.0s	2164.0	 that's one of the things about being an entrepreneur is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2165.9s	2165.9	 figuring out how you stay alive while you answer these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2169.1s	2169.1	 questions. And you came up with a brilliant one or whoever was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2171.8s	2171.8	 doing Virgin Galactic, which is people will overpay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2176.0s	2176.0	 No, but Virgin was a 15 year process where Richard Branson to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2179.7s	2179.7	 his credit did exactly what David said. Here's $10 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2183.2s	2183.2	 get to milestone one. Here's $25 million get to milestone two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2187.4s	2187.4	 He did the exact venture capital model. It's just that he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2190.0s	2190.0	 did it by himself. I think what David is saying, which I agree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2192.8s	2192.8	 with is you should never short circuit that and say here's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2195.7s	2195.7	 $500 million pre series a just go with that. Sure. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2199.4s	2199.4	 magic leap. You'll be working at something for 20 years with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2202.1s	2202.1	 nothing to show for it as in fusion as in quantum computer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2205.7s	2205.7	 All right. You end up with like you end up with a magic leap or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2210.6s	2210.6	 Theranos. Theranos or even Theranos was a it looks like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2215.4s	2215.4	 it's a fraud, but Magic Leap just looks like it's technically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2217.7s	2217.7	 incompetent. Or it's too hard of a technical problem to solve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2221.7s	2221.7	 in the amount of time and the amount of technical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2224.2s	2224.2	 incompetence. Well, I don't know if it's incompetence. This
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2226.4s	2226.4	 might be a it might be a 20 year problem as opposed to a five.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2229.2s	2229.2	 But why are you taking this emotionally? Technical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2231.0s	2231.0	 incompetence is the opposite of technical competence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2233.3s	2233.3	 Competence means you can do it. Technical incompetence means
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2236.0s	2236.0	 you can't do it. I thought you were saying that that group of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2237.8s	2237.8	 people is incompetent. I'm saying the words technical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2240.3s	2240.3	 followed by the word incompetence. Technical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2242.7s	2242.7	 incompetence. Okay. When you're saying it, I think you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2245.6s	2245.6	 describing the person not the problem. It could have been too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2248.3s	2248.3	 hard to lift for them. So yeah. Okay. Well, the last question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2251.6s	2251.6	 is about access to private equity, but let's just go into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2253.5s	2253.5	 this deck here. Now, one of the things we wanted to talk to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2255.6s	2255.6	 today, Chamath had a good idea. Venture capital is changing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2259.6s	2259.6	 rapidly. The last decade has seen more change in venture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2263.3s	2263.3	 capital than I would argue the four decades, or five decades
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2267.3s	2267.3	 that venture capital has existed. In other words, more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2269.6s	2269.6	 change. And we're going to go through some of those changes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2272.1s	2272.1	 how it affects the entrepreneur, how it affects the investor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2275.6s	2275.6	 Chamath was nice enough to put a deck together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2277.6s	2277.6	 And then I guess Jason will figure out a way to post this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2280.1s	2280.1	 into the YouTube or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2282.1s	2282.1	 You know what we'll put in the show notes a link to this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2284.4s	2284.4	 Google presentation and Nick can pull up the slides when we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2288.7s	2288.7	 talking about them. I think I think if folks can give us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2291.1s	2291.1	 feedback, this is kind of a new thing for us. We're trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2293.6s	2293.6	 experiment, which is sort of this is like a half teach in half
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2296.4s	2296.4	 discussion on something we all wanted to talk about. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2299.1s	2299.1	 hopefully you guys get some value from it. But tell us if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2302.4s	2302.4	 it's not. So I want to thank Carmen Collins on my team who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2306.9s	2306.9	 helped put this together. But let me just go through this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2310.0s	2310.0	 state of venture capital. So a couple of high level points,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2314.4s	2314.4	 there's like some really important trends at play. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2316.6s	2316.6	 first is that there really is now underneath a massive change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2320.6s	2320.6	 in the players in this game. Founder demographics are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2324.0s	2324.0	 changing slowly but surely, we're going to go into that in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2326.6s	2326.6	 a second. Traditional VC investors are getting disrupted,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2330.6s	2330.6	 we're going to go that we're going to go into that. And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2333.8s	2333.8	 this model, which I love of, let me know how I can be helpful,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2337.1s	2337.1	 quote unquote, basically eroding and ceding ground to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2342.0s	2342.0	 what we call solo capitalists. And we'll talk about that, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2344.8s	2344.8	 is probably the most disruptive trend in venture. Second, we'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2348.8s	2348.8	 talk about the inflation in the amount of money that's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2352.0s	2352.0	 into these companies, which really means more money at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2354.4s	2354.4	 higher prices, and why that's good in some ways and actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2358.4s	2358.4	 bad in some other ways. This goes back to David's point of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2361.5s	2361.5	 you know, not being forced to generate milestones sooner. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2365.6s	2365.6	 then the third is that it's really now a founders market. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2368.4s	2368.4	 I think this is really important because, you know, you've seen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2371.2s	2371.2	 an enormous amount of dilution and lack of control for founders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2376.2s	2376.2	 and employee teams and companies. And I think that there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2378.4s	2378.4	 are some really disruptive new ways that completely usurp
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2382.4s	2382.4	 traditional venture, non dilutive forms of financing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2384.7s	2384.7	 we'll talk about that. So let me just level set for you guys. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2388.5s	2388.5	 asked the following question, what are the demographics of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2391.6s	2391.6	 United States? And here's what they are in the United States
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2394.2s	2394.2	 today. 59.7% of people are white, non Hispanic, 12 and a half
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2402.3s	2402.3	 percent are black, 5.8 are Asian, 18.7% are Hispanic, and 2.3 are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2409.3s	2409.3	 multi race. If you map that to VC founders, 77% of VC founders are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2417.6s	2417.6	 white, 1% are black, 17.7% are Asian, 1.8% are Hispanic, and two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2426.0s	2426.0	 and a half are multi race. So amongst multi race Asian and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2429.5s	2429.5	 white, you either are at or over indexing your representative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2432.8s	2432.8	 population and blacks and Hispanics. This is not anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2435.1s	2435.1	 new, but massively underrepresented. If you take it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2437.3s	2437.3	 from a gender, females have lower representation among
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2441.1s	2441.1	 founders, but it's growing. So the US is basically 5050 male,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2445.6s	2445.6	 female female founded companies were 23% of all deal activity in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2450.4s	2450.4	 2019. That's, that's pretty good. Up from 12% in 2010. Although
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2456.3s	2456.3	 racial diversity is still pretty lacking, which we know, and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2459.9s	2459.9	 the young tech bro stereotype is cracking, which is this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2464.0s	2464.0	 incredible 2019 study in the Times showed that the average
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2468.6s	2468.6	 age of a tech founder is David Sachs, what do you think it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2472.0s	2472.0	 the average age of a tech founder median or average mean or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2475.3s	2475.3	 median average? Well, I saw I saw your deck. So isn't it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2478.0s	2478.0	 something like it was surprisingly 3540 42 for you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2482.8s	2482.8	 I'm seeing a lot I think I don't know, just to pause here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2485.3s	2485.3	 for a moment. What do we think we can still found a company? You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2488.0s	2488.0	 can. What do we think is given we had the longevity question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2491.8s	2491.8	 earlier, and then you have people, you know, generating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2496.5s	2496.5	 wealth and starting companies in their 40s, 50s and 60s, who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2500.0s	2500.0	 then underwrite it themselves, right until they get to product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2504.0s	2504.0	 market fit and then raise money. What do we think is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2506.4s	2506.4	 best zone for an entrepreneur in terms of having a great outcome?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2511.8s	2511.8	 I've always thought that the look I when I how old was I I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2516.0s	2516.0	 was 3132 when I started social capital. I mean, this is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2523.4s	2523.4	 multi billion dollar enterprise, I feel like I'm reasonably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2526.2s	2526.2	 successful at it. But I was preparing for the first 13 or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2530.0s	2530.0	 14 years of my professional career, I learned some good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2532.9s	2532.9	 things, I learned some bad things, I learned tactics that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2536.0s	2536.0	 worked, I learned strategies that didn't work 30s or 40s or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2540.8s	2540.8	 in my experience for me, and I think it's for personal for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2544.2s	2544.2	 everybody, I was best positioned to know what to do, and at least
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2548.8s	2548.8	 iterate in my 30s. And I think in the absence of an idea that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2555.0s	2555.0	 has some network effect or something that's sort of like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2559.2s	2559.2	 supernatural outside of your own control. I think the older you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2562.7s	2562.7	 are, generally, probably the better prepared you'll be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2565.7s	2565.7	 Yeah, I agree. I mean, I did PayPal when I was still in my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2568.4s	2568.4	 20s. But I wasn't the founder of the company, I was recruited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2571.6s	2571.6	 to it at a very early stage. I didn't really start Yammer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2574.7s	2574.7	 until well, I guess I started the predecessor company, Genie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2577.2s	2577.2	 when I was 34. And then Yammer pivoted into Yammer when I was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2580.9s	2580.9	 35. I mean, absolutely. That's that's like, that's like a good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2584.9s	2584.9	 level of preparation, you know, unless you have a spectacular
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2588.7s	2588.7	 idea for a startup, you should probably get some experience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2592.9s	2592.9	 first. 100% freeburg. Any thoughts there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2597.0s	2597.0	 On what's the kill zone best time to launch companies in your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2600.2s	2600.2	 mind or investing companies or where founders are?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2602.6s	2602.6	 Everyone's got their own path, you know, I mean, Zuck and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2605.7s	2605.7	 Sergey and Larry and Bill Gates, they started right out of college
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2610.3s	2610.3	 without any experience. But I mean, I worked at I had two jobs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2616.1s	2616.1	 in tech before I started my first company in 2006. Yeah. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2621.0s	2621.0	 so I had a lot to draw from and that really informed me but I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2623.7s	2623.7	 think everyone's different. I mean, some people if you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2626.0s	2626.0	 the idea, if you have the idea, by all means do it in your 20s,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2629.3s	2629.3	 you know, but I mean, by far the greatest kind of like, measure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2634.5s	2634.5	 of whether and when you're kind of prepared for this is your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2636.8s	2636.8	 ability to continue learning, you know, continuous learning to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2639.4s	2639.4	 me is one of the greatest predictors of entrepreneurial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2641.6s	2641.6	 success. And all the guys that have lasted for decades from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2645.3s	2645.3	 Bezos to Zuck to, you know, Larry and Sergey, you know, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2649.3s	2649.3	 were continuously evolving themselves because they were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2651.3s	2651.3	 continuous learners. Bill Gates is Bill Gates is the penultimate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2654.4s	2654.4	 example of this, right? I mean, this guy's reinvented himself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2656.4s	2656.4	 1000 times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2657.7s	2657.7	 That what you said is so important. I'm going to change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2660.3s	2660.3	 my answer. I think I started social capital when I was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2664.8s	2664.8	 actually the most able to get out of my own way and learn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2667.9s	2667.9	 continuously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2668.7s	2668.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2669.2s	2669.2	 Yeah. You know, what one thing I'd add to this is it's so much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2673.2s	2673.2	 easier to be a founder now today that I mean, look, I remember
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2677.8s	2677.8	 I joined PayPal in 1999. That was my first startup. It was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2681.0s	2681.0	 like really hard to get into entrepreneurship in the 1990s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2684.4s	2684.4	 You know, the VCs had tremendous power and control. They would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2689.5s	2689.5	 routinely replace founder CEOs, you know, everyone had to go to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2693.1s	2693.1	 Sand Hill Road to get capital. It was hard to even know how to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2696.0s	2696.0	 network your way to Sand Hill Road. It was just much, much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2699.6s	2699.6	 harder to be a founder. It was much harder to raise money. It
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2701.6s	2701.6	 was hard to know what to do. And then I think actually one of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2705.5s	2705.5	 the things that really changed things was with blogging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2709.2s	2709.2	 emerging in the mid 2000s, it led to a proliferation of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2712.2s	2712.2	 information where now, you know, other founders started
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2715.7s	2715.7	 blogging, investors started blogging and there became a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2719.2s	2719.2	 wealth of information out there so you could learn how to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2722.6s	2722.6	 And then of course you had incubators and so on like YC. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2725.6s	2725.6	 there became more of like a playbook for just like how you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2728.4s	2728.4	 actually get a company off the ground. When I graduated law
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2731.0s	2731.0	 school, which was 1998, I knew I wanted to get into business and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2734.3s	2734.3	 entrepreneurship. I really had no idea how to do it. And if it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2737.5s	2737.5	 wasn't for a phone call from Peter Thiel, I'm not sure I would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2740.4s	2740.4	 have gotten into it. You know, but now now everybody knows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2743.3s	2743.3	 what to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2743.8s	2743.8	 Can I ask you a question then? So let me let me give you a stat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2746.2s	2746.2	 and I'll ask a question. What do you think that story would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2750.9s	2750.9	 David for somebody that wasn't a white man? So here's the here's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2754.3s	2754.3	 the data. The percentage of female VC decision makers has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2758.2s	2758.2	 grown by more than 2x. What that means is about firms over a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2762.7s	2762.7	 billion dollars, about a quarter of them have at least two plus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2766.0s	2766.0	 female decision makers, but 61% of them have zero and 80% of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2770.9s	2770.9	 venture firms still have no black investors. How do you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2775.0s	2775.0	 correlate or intersect that idea of ease of starting a company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2779.8s	2779.8	 with the pattern recognition of those folks and the inability to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2784.0s	2784.0	 sort of maybe map to people with black skin or women?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2790.0s	2790.0	 I mean, I think that what Silicon Valley and what venture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2792.8s	2792.8	 capital represents is opportunity, right? And we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2795.4s	2795.4	 to extend that opportunity to as many people as possible. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2798.1s	2798.1	 mean, that's really the the key here is we do need to make it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2801.2s	2801.2	 as widely available as possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2803.4s	2803.4	 By the way, Chamath, I mean, one way to slice things is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2806.0s	2806.0	 percent percentage of diverse representation within the ranks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2810.3s	2810.3	 of venture and private equity. But there is an equivalent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2815.1s	2815.1	 scaling in the number of venture firms and the amount of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2817.5s	2817.5	 venture capital since, you know, Sachs and you and I and all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2821.5s	2821.5	 us kind of entered the technology industry kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2823.7s	2823.7	 early 2000. And the number of firms that exist today that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2829.0s	2829.0	 kind of micro firms and scaled firms, I think presents a much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2833.4s	2833.4	 larger set of opportunity. You're right, there are still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2836.3s	2836.3	 standards and there are still challenges in diversity and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2840.4s	2840.4	 having access. But there is so much more access than there has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2844.4s	2844.4	 ever been. And that's really changed the landscape. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2847.5s	2847.5	 folks coming out of college can get a million dollars that was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2850.2s	2850.2	 kind of unheard of back in 1999.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2852.4s	2852.4	 Or or or the reality is like there's so many incubators. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2856.4s	2856.4	 mean, it's not as if Jason or YC or any of these folks give
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2860.0s	2860.0	 millions of dollars, right, Jason? Like these checks are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2862.0s	2862.0	 still really small. So the point is, you can build something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2864.8s	2864.8	 if you have the skills to build something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2867.3s	2867.3	 The the the gap right now is that there's a lot of people who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2871.0s	2871.0	 have ideas about what they want to do. But they have no skills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2875.1s	2875.1	 And I think what we found in a vibrant market like today, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2879.0s	2879.0	 mean, this is the most vibrant I've ever seen it, there's at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2881.0s	2881.0	 least three or four times as many startups to choose from at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2883.8s	2883.8	 the earliest stages. And what we're seeing is, the number of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2887.6s	2887.6	 VCs has not grown at that level, it has grown, the number of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2890.7s	2890.7	 players has grown, but not at that level. Therefore, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2893.3s	2893.3	 average quality of a deal has gone up. The average quality of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2896.8s	2896.8	 a funded deal has gone up. But the average quality of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2900.2s	2900.2	 startup has gone down. Does that make sense? Yeah, so the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2903.5s	2903.5	 ones that get funded are better than ever. But the one the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2906.5s	2906.5	 average is lower, because there's so many doing it. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2908.7s	2908.7	 then just the best piece of advice I have is when we talked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2910.8s	2910.8	 about continuous learning, is if you are not building the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2914.0s	2914.0	 product in some way or selling the product in some way, then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2916.7s	2916.7	 what are you doing at this startup, like you either build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2919.0s	2919.0	 it or you sell it, like, it really isn't much more there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2922.0s	2922.0	 And a lot of people just have ideas and no ability to execute,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2924.6s	2924.6	 you really have to be a developer designer, UX person,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2927.6s	2927.6	 marketer, something in terms of getting this product out to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2931.1s	2931.1	 world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2932.4s	2932.4	 What, what do you guys think about this other trend, which I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2934.8s	2934.8	 think is really important, which is the atomization of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2937.4s	2937.4	 firms. So, you know, we're moving from a world where people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2940.4s	2940.4	 used to care about name the brand, Sequoia, Excel, and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2945.6s	2945.6	 now they named the person, right, and they'll probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2949.2s	2949.2	 follow that person wherever they are. So what do we think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2953.0s	2953.0	 about that? There's a really interesting tweet from Eric
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2955.1s	2955.1	 Torenberg, he said, founders don't want to raise money from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2959.0s	2959.0	 institutions as much anymore, they want to raise money from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2961.6s	2961.6	 individuals. And then if you marry that with what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2963.5s	2963.5	 happening with Angel List, and all this other stuff, isn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2966.4s	2966.4	 that the trail of breadcrumbs for how like VC just kind of, in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2970.4s	2970.4	 some ways, just kind of gets blown up the way that it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2972.6s	2972.6	 normally been done?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2974.2s	2974.2	 I remember as a founder, when I started my company in 2006,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2979.2s	2979.2	 there was a lot of this conversation in as, as Sachs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2982.7s	2982.7	 pointed out, in the blogger community, blogging community,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2985.4s	2985.4	 and with like various websites that rated VCs. And there was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2989.2s	2989.2	 generally a trend in the support network among CEOs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2991.7s	2991.7	 adventure firms, of talking a lot about make sure you pick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2995.5s	2995.5	 your partner, don't pick the firm. And so this, I don't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=2998.9s	2998.9	 if this is necessarily a new trench, Amoth, it's certainly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3001.4s	3001.4	 something that I remember being top of mind 15 years ago, when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3004.4s	3004.4	 I started my first company. And so much of it was about make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3007.7s	3007.7	 sure you have the right partner, because that's who's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3009.3s	3009.3	 going to be on your board. That's who you're going to spend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3010.8s	3010.8	 time with. That's who's going to recruit executives with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3013.3s	3013.3	 That's who's going to be helpful in finding your next round of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3015.2s	3015.2	 funding for you. And I feel like that's always been the case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3018.8s	3018.8	 But you're right, the brand value of a firm has certainly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3021.6s	3021.6	 become less useful. And folks have struggled to kind of figure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3025.3s	3025.3	 out, I think, a solution here. I mean, you see what Andreessen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3028.1s	3028.1	 Horowitz did. They launched in 2009 and really focused on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3030.7s	3030.7	 trying to be this kind of full service provider to startups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3033.8s	3033.8	 And I don't know how much that matters as much anymore, as much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3036.8s	3036.8	 as making sure you've got a great partner from the firm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3039.2s	3039.2	 that's helping you with your business. I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3041.1s	3041.1	 It's actually you're right, Freeberg, that's a continuing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3044.1s	3044.1	 trend. What I'll say is the top firms are still as attractive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3047.6s	3047.6	 or more attractive to founders. The loser in this, I believe is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3050.8s	3050.8	 the mid tier firm, or the lower tier firms that actually, none
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3055.3s	3055.3	 of the partners, they're all that great. The performance is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3058.0s	3058.0	 not that great. Their value add is not that great. But when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3060.3s	3060.3	 do get a Sequoia or an Andreessen, when I put Kraft in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3064.1s	3064.1	 this as well, when you get one of those all star VC firms to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3067.6s	3067.6	 join your board specifically, that is the key when they join
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3070.4s	3070.4	 the board, they own over 10%. You are anointed in a way that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3074.5s	3074.5	 is transcendent, you will get pounded with inbound from the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3078.4s	3078.4	 second tier and third tier firms who want to triple your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3081.1s	3081.1	 valuation and give you 20 million bucks, it happens like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3084.4s	3084.4	 clockwork. In fact, there are a couple of firms like it was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3087.0s	3087.0	 DAG, the one sacks that would always follow on Sequoia deals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3091.4s	3091.4	 And so there were firms that were built around that was their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3093.7s	3093.7	 LP pitch, DAG's LP pitch is we just we will mark up every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3097.0s	3097.0	 Sequoia deal. Exactly. So it was one page. So it's like if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3102.0s	3102.0	 can't get into Sequoia, and you're willing to wait an extra
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3104.4s	3104.4	 round to invest in DAG. Well, and then now, I think the big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3107.6s	3107.6	 trend here is those firms Andreessen and Sequoia are now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3111.9s	3111.9	 full stage where they have the late stage growth, they have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3115.2s	3115.2	 scout program, they have a seed program, they have a series a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3118.1s	3118.1	 program. So the full life cycle, it's not those guys also, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3121.5s	3121.5	 just, it's all these other big crossover guys that have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3123.6s	3123.6	 come down Tiger, Koto, durable. I think that's the biggest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3127.0s	3127.0	 trend of the last 15 years Chamath. And I think it is what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3130.3s	3130.3	 has enabled the proliferation of early stage startups and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3133.4s	3133.4	 enabled the valuation increments in the capital that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3135.6s	3135.6	 flowed in the early stage is the is the scale down from the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3140.1s	3140.1	 big guys. I just want to kind of do a quick walk down memory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3143.8s	3143.8	 lane. Because when you guys said you wanted to talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3145.2s	3145.2	 this, I kind of remembered I got my series B term sheet in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3147.8s	3147.8	 2008, I guess it was. And, or 2009, and I had three venture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3154.4s	3154.4	 firms, Andreessen was one of them that gave me a term sheet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3157.9s	3157.9	 And the interesting thing about at that time with Andreessen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3160.2s	3160.2	 was they gave me a term sheet, I was trying to raise $30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3161.9s	3161.9	 million. And they said, we want to give you 40 million. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3164.0s	3164.0	 they upped the valuation significantly. And, and there was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3167.5s	3167.5	 a I ultimately went with coastal ventures. But there was this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3170.9s	3170.9	 trend that Andreessen was kind of imparting. And I heard about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3175.7s	3175.7	 it a lot from other entrepreneurs, was that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3178.4s	3178.4	 were going out and offering more money than the founder was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3180.8s	3180.8	 asking for seeking at higher valuations. And it was this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3184.2s	3184.2	 trend towards saying like, go grab the market, because the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3186.5s	3186.5	 interesting thing about web scale, economics, and, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3190.4s	3190.4	 web scale businesses, is you get so much leverage, and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3193.6s	3193.6	 can get extraordinarily rapid growth. I mean, the rate of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3196.1s	3196.1	 growth could be infinite. And the leverage could be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3199.2s	3199.2	 infinite. And so if you do it, if you do it at the right round,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3202.0s	3202.0	 I think that's, but so much of this was and then obviously,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3205.0s	3205.0	 so that was a huge step up. And I remember Andreessen Horowitz
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3207.6s	3207.6	 beginning 2009 kind of started to build a reputation for doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3210.6s	3210.6	 this of kind of, you know, putting larger checks out and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3212.9s	3212.9	 saying go scale. And then the big crazy thing was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3216.2s	3216.2	 crossover guy started coming in and offering bigger checks in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3219.6s	3219.6	 kind of this proven stage growth stage kind of funding. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3222.4s	3222.4	 then obviously, the big step up was SoftBank and SoftBank with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3224.9s	3224.9	 $100 billion vision fund. And ultimately, what exactly did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3229.5s	3229.5	 that disrupt? Freeburg? Just hang on to when all these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3232.0s	3232.0	 happened, those large chunks of capital became available in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3234.9s	3234.9	 valuation step ups were so significant for these later
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3237.6s	3237.6	 stage startups, that the money flowed down and more money was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3241.2s	3241.2	 raised in earlier stage venture that enabled this proliferation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3244.7s	3244.7	 of capital and this proliferation of new startups and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3246.8s	3246.8	 enablement of startups at the earlier stage, because of all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3249.5s	3249.5	 the crossover money that started to come in and the blitz
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3251.6s	3251.6	 scaling of proposals, and lots of money that was being thrown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3254.5s	3254.5	 in at the later stage. That to me felt like the reason all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3257.7s	3257.7	 the earlier stage stuff proliferated was because of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3260.1s	3260.1	 amount of capital later stage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3262.0s	3262.0	 You're absolutely right. And now 10 years later, here's where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3264.6s	3264.6	 we are in the early-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3266.0s	3266.0	 SPACs are the next step, Chamath, because like-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3268.1s	3268.1	 Totally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3268.6s	3268.6	 I think what you did, you know, we pre 2009, there was $10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3271.5s	3271.5	 billion a year in SPACs. Then when you started this in 2009,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3274.6s	3274.6	 stepped up to 2019, it stepped up to 13 billion. Last year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3278.5s	3278.5	 80 billion was raised in SPACs. This quarter, 100 billion in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3282.5s	3282.5	 SPACs. And SPACs are that you cross over investing. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3285.0s	3285.0	 taking growth stage, private equity style risk in the public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3288.2s	3288.2	 markets with this proliferation of capital. And we're seeing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3290.9s	3290.9	 the benefit in the early stage and founders and entrepreneurs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3293.2s	3293.2	 are seeing the benefit because there's so much access to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3295.0s	3295.0	 capital on the back end. You can take more risk on the early
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3297.8s	3297.8	 end and you can make more bets. And I think it's the next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3301.6s	3301.6	 step up and we just keep seeing these step ups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3303.6s	3303.6	 Yeah, I tend to think that the growth stage is the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3306.4s	3306.4	 troubled and challenged because at the early stage, you can get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3308.8s	3308.8	 a guy like Sachs or J.K.L. on your board and you can grind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3312.0s	3312.0	 And I think that that's really important to get to product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3314.0s	3314.0	 market fit. And at the public stage, you can get somebody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3316.7s	3316.7	 like me and we can help transact and actually help optimize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3320.0s	3320.0	 and run the business for scale and value. But in the middle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3322.8s	3322.8	 you have all these weird dynamics that no longer maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3326.2s	3326.2	 don't make as much sense. So just to give you a sense of it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3328.4s	3328.4	 the average deal size, okay, so the typical round is up 3X
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3334.2s	3334.2	 over the last 10 years. 3X.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3337.4s	3337.4	 That is absolutely anecdotally my experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3340.8s	3340.8	 In late stage, investors are doubling and tripling down on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3344.2s	3344.2	 these mega deals so that that average round size is up 5X in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3348.7s	3348.7	 the last decade. The typical pre money on a growth stage deal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3353.9s	3353.9	 in 2010 was 100 pre. This is for the top quartile.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3358.2s	3358.2	 And it's now or sorry for this is for the average.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3360.3s	3360.3	 It's now this is for a growth stage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3362.1s	3362.1	 Yeah, growth stage at 100 pre is now 570 pre.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3368.0s	3368.0	 Wow. Yeah, it's getting crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3370.7s	3370.7	 It's really it's really getting crazy. Tiger it says here in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3373.6s	3373.6	 the notes Tiger Global has announced the deal according to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3376.1s	3376.1	 pitch book every 48 hours in 2021.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3380.0s	3380.0	 Well, here's an interesting thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3382.6s	3382.6	 That's fabulous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3383.8s	3383.8	 That's fucking fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3385.0s	3385.0	 What Tiger I think has figured out is there they started as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3387.7s	3387.7	 public market investors and work their way down the stack,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3390.0s	3390.0	 right? So they're very familiar with the public market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3392.3s	3392.3	 valuations. They're seeing that these SaaS companies are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3395.6s	3395.6	 you know, we I remember 10 years ago when I was doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3398.3s	3398.3	 Yammer, we thought that the best outcome that you could have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3401.4s	3401.4	 as a SaaS company was like a one to $2 billion exit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3404.1s	3404.1	 That's why when Microsoft offered us 1.2 billion in 2012,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3407.9s	3407.9	 we took it right. We're like we could work five more years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3410.2s	3410.2	 maybe get to a $2 billion outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3411.9s	3411.9	 Well, now you're seeing what Slack just got acquired by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3414.8s	3414.8	 Salesforce for close to 30 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3416.8s	3416.8	 It's pretty routine to see SaaS companies IPOing it now 10,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3421.0s	3421.0	 20, 30 billion and up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3423.2s	3423.2	 And so the exits are just so much bigger than anybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3426.4s	3426.4	 thought 10 years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3428.6s	3428.6	 And we were the optimist, by the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3430.2s	3430.2	 There's a good tweet on this by it was Jay Malik.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3434.1s	3434.1	 Basically, he gave some stats. He said that if you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3437.8s	3437.8	 wondering why everyone wants to invest or be a VC today,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3440.7s	3440.7	 the stats from PitchBook provide an answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3443.0s	3443.0	 We had 43 billion in exits in 2010.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3445.6s	3445.6	 We had 290 billion in exits in 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3449.2s	3449.2	 So we had about 7x roughly greater exits over the course
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3453.5s	3453.5	 of a decade. Now, the average deal size has grown 3x and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3456.8s	3456.8	 there's a lot more money going into venture capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3459.2s	3459.2	 But the reason why you're having all this money go in and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3462.0s	3462.0	 all these new players is because the outcomes are so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3464.4s	3464.4	 much bigger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3465.1s	3465.1	 And then he said, and I agree with this, wouldn't be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3466.8s	3466.8	 surprised if VC hits 1 trillion by 2030.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3470.4s	3470.4	 So we're seeing just that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3471.8s	3471.8	 I mean, I remember 20 years ago when I first got into the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3473.8s	3473.8	 business, you know, like Silicon Valley was a small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3476.8s	3476.8	 little concentric circle around Stanford.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3480.1s	3480.1	 And now it's spread to San Francisco and the entire Bay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3483.6s	3483.6	 Area and to other cities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3485.8s	3485.8	 And it just keeps getting bigger and bigger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3487.4s	3487.4	 I mean, it's the digitization of every market, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3490.0s	3490.0	 I mean, every traditional business, every traditional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3492.2s	3492.2	 industry is being digitized in some way or another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3494.5s	3494.5	 And so it's no longer a tech enabler of other industries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3497.2s	3497.2	 It is the industry itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3498.5s	3498.5	 We know that the brand really matters in the early stage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3502.5s	3502.5	 because they anoint you and they bring so much value in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3505.2s	3505.2	 terms of working with you to solve problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3507.2s	3507.2	 We know with SPACs, whoever and IPOs, whoever is anointing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3511.1s	3511.1	 that really matters, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3512.2s	3512.2	 The sponsor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3513.2s	3513.2	 But in the middle is all that cash now moved to a game of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3518.6s	3518.6	 who will pay the most for the least rights.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3520.7s	3520.7	 In other words, series B to, you know, when you get involved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3524.4s	3524.4	 Chamath, is that just-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3525.4s	3525.4	 It's such a good point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3526.4s	3526.4	 So what you're now teeing up, Jason, is this next big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3529.5s	3529.5	 category, which is if it's undifferentiated capital, at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3534.3s	3534.3	 some point, you're going to go to the logical conclusion,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3536.4s	3536.4	 which is I don't want any dilution from this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3539.0s	3539.0	 I'm happy to take dilution in the series A when I get, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3542.0s	3542.0	 know, Kraft or Sequoia or Benchmark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3544.8s	3544.8	 I'm happy to take dilution in the IPO because that's sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3547.4s	3547.4	 the necessary process of diversifying the stock ownership,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3550.7s	3550.7	 getting my users and my customers to be able to own the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3553.6s	3553.6	 stock, et cetera, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3555.5s	3555.5	 But in the middle, now you have these companies like Pipe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3558.4s	3558.4	 and ClearBank, where now all of a sudden you can grow, Jason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3561.6s	3561.6	 in your BCD rounds and you have zero dilution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3564.7s	3564.7	 So if you're a founder, you know, the best formula is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3567.6s	3567.6	 going to be take series A and seed capital from an expert,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3571.6s	3571.6	 single GP brand person who knows that business category so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3576.0s	3576.0	 well, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3577.0s	3577.0	 If you're starting a SaaS company, you should probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3578.8s	3578.8	 get your seed from Saks, you know, raise your A from some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3583.4s	3583.4	 expert or what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3584.3s	3584.3	 Let me say differently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3585.2s	3585.2	 Seed from Jcal, A from Saks, and then go to Pipe and ClearBank
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3590.2s	3590.2	 and fund it all based on your recurring revenue growth and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3593.3s	3593.3	 then go public via SPAC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3594.8s	3594.8	 So just to give you some data that I got from Pipe and ClearBank.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3597.5s	3597.5	 Which means you would just to give people an idea of what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3599.3s	3599.3	 the cap table would look like there, you would dilute 10%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3601.7s	3601.7	 in your seed round, 20% in your A.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3604.8s	3604.8	 Now you still have 70% of the company and you just sell your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3608.0s	3608.0	 yearly contracts ahead of time to Pipe and you're done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3610.5s	3610.5	 By the way, can I tell the story about Pipe?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3612.4s	3612.4	 So Pipe, Pipe, Harry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3614.6s	3614.6	 Thanks for including Freeberg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3615.8s	3615.8	 David, David, can I give the stat from Pipe and then you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3618.0s	3618.0	 can tell the story?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3618.8s	3618.8	 Sorry, you guys are all investors in this company?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3621.0s	3621.0	 No, not me and you, David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3622.1s	3622.1	 They let us, our beaks are dry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3623.8s	3623.8	 My beak is so wet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3625.9s	3625.9	 My beak is so wet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3627.1s	3627.1	 It is dripping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3627.2s	3627.2	 Can we get a profile of that beak?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3628.5s	3628.5	 Let's see it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3628.8s	3628.8	 I don't know why.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3629.2s	3629.2	 Let's see it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3629.8s	3629.8	 It is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3630.4s	3630.4	 Oh my Lord.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3631.1s	3631.1	 It is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3631.6s	3631.6	 People don't realize.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3632.4s	3632.4	 It really is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3633.4s	3633.4	 Hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3634.4s	3634.4	 Do it one more time and let me compare it to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3637.0s	3637.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3637.2s	3637.2	 It's a beautiful beak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3638.1s	3638.1	 No, I'll tell, let me tell, let me tell the Pipe beak wedding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3640.9s	3640.9	 story because Harry, Harry, the founders told the story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3644.3s	3644.3	 He came in to meet with me in my office at Kraft.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3647.2s	3647.2	 This is pre-COVID when people actually met in person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3650.7s	3650.7	 Our principal who's based in LA, Michael Tam knew Harry from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3653.8s	3653.8	 his previous startup and brought him in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3655.7s	3655.7	 I heard the pitch, which is basically to advance the full
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3659.8s	3659.8	 value of these contracts for SaaS companies and others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3663.6s	3663.6	 But it was so obvious, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3665.3s	3665.3	 Because if you're a SaaS company, you spend roughly about a year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3670.0s	3670.0	 of revenue on customer acquisition costs, but the customer only wants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3675.7s	3675.7	 to pay you monthly and so you have this huge negative cash flow cycle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3679.2s	3679.2	 So what if you could just take that contract and monetize it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3682.5s	3682.5	 right away, get the full value of the contract advance, then you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3686.1s	3686.1	 plow it into the next, the next customer acquisition cost.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3690.5s	3690.5	 And you don't need to dilute yourself with venture capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3693.6s	3693.6	 I said yes to Harry in like 15 minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3695.6s	3695.6	 I think it's the quickest I've ever given a term sheet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3698.6s	3698.6	 We invested 2 million in the company in a 12 cap and we did the deal that day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3704.6s	3704.6	 So within nine months of launch, Pipe has connected 3,500 customers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3710.5s	3710.5	 and over a billion plus of ARR to investors willing to purchase that revenue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3715.8s	3715.8	 Clear bank.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3716.4s	3716.4	 Clear, it's a marketplace.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3717.8s	3717.8	 I'd so they're not buying the debt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3720.4s	3720.4	 Anybody can go on the marketplace and say, I will buy Slack's revenue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3724.9s	3724.9	 for 91 cents on the dollar, but something more speculative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3727.2s	3727.2	 They might pay 85.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3728.2s	3728.2	 This is a brilliant thing is that they're not, they're not providing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3731.2s	3731.2	 the lending off their own balance sheet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3732.5s	3732.5	 Suppose a clear bank, which does in charge of 6% every 60 days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3735.7s	3735.7	 Unless you guys share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3738.8s	3738.8	 Fucking bullshit guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3740.3s	3740.3	 Listen, I'm going to go ahead and do my email now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3744.2s	3744.2	 Yeah, I'm good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3744.7s	3744.7	 Let's do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3745.2s	3745.2	 Freeberg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3745.7s	3745.7	 Hey, freeberg, let's launch a bio company together and we'll block out these beaks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3749.7s	3749.7	 Go work on your life extension.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3751.6s	3751.6	 We're working on our monetary extension right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3754.9s	3754.9	 Yeah, you need more money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3756.0s	3756.0	 You need more money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3757.6s	3757.6	 So clear bank works with the e-commerce companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3759.6s	3759.6	 So what you do is you stitch in your connections to Shopify and Stripe, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3764.1s	3764.1	 They're able to monitor how well you do and then they'll basically help finance you again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3768.1s	3768.1	 non-dilutably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3768.8s	3768.8	 So clear bank companies captured 55% more growth in 2020 than the prior year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3773.8s	3773.8	 So even in the midst of COVID, these companies did really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3776.8s	3776.8	 They have revenue-based financing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3779.7s	3779.7	 They've invested $1.6 billion to date.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3782.8s	3782.8	 And it turns out that their investor composition, eight times more women funded than traditional VC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3788.9s	3788.9	 By the way, I want to be clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3789.8s	3789.8	 I was also a series A investor in clear bank.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3792.4s	3792.4	 I mean, I am such a believer in this middle section of venture disappearing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3797.2s	3797.2	 Like when you have these growth rounds, they're undifferentiated and they shouldn't be dilutive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3803.1s	3803.1	 in any way, shape or form.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3804.1s	3804.1	 The founders should figure out how to grow non-dilutably the minute that they have some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3808.9s	3808.9	 semblance of product market fit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3810.7s	3810.7	 So then the dilutive points are the bookends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3813.5s	3813.5	 Yeah, this was kind of the idea with like Indiegogo and some of the GoFundMe types or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3817.6s	3817.6	 not GoFundMe, the other things where you could basically pre-sell consumer products too,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3821.6s	3821.6	 right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3821.8s	3821.8	 Where you could get funded in a similar way and you could see the same transitioning into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3826.0s	3826.0	 kind of hardware businesses and other consumer businesses, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3830.2s	3830.2	 There's an even bigger trend that happened that I can talk to, which is equity crowdfunding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3835.4s	3835.4	 CF, but I don't want to take you off your deck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3837.4s	3837.4	 So do you want to keep going on the deck or do you want to stop?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3839.4s	3839.4	 The only last thing I say is that the other big thing as Friedberg says is like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3844.5s	3844.5	 so let me just summarize.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3845.9s	3845.9	 So it's kind of like, I think where we're all going to is we see the venture capitalist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3851.3s	3851.3	 changing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3851.6s	3851.6	 The financial stack, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3853.6s	3853.6	 It's going from organizations and these amorphous financial orgs down to individuals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3860.5s	3860.5	 As that happens, I think what we're all kind of stating is it's incredibly valuable at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3865.8s	3865.8	 earliest stages to align yourself with a person that knows your business or your market,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3870.8s	3870.8	 right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3871.4s	3871.4	 And that's worth some amount of dilution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3873.1s	3873.1	 It's almost like getting a quasi co-founder, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3875.3s	3875.3	 So in the seed and the series A, but I think so that's one really important point of what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3880.8s	3880.8	 happening in the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3882.3s	3882.3	 The second thing that I think we're all saying is why are we diluting ourselves to grow in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3887.5s	3887.5	 these middle rounds?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3888.5s	3888.5	 If you don't have to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3890.4s	3890.4	 It's unnecessary and there should be really clever ways of non-dilutably financing yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3895.4s	3895.4	 And as the market becomes more and more sophisticated, there will be more companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3899.7s	3899.7	 beyond Pipe and ClearBank to be clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3901.7s	3901.7	 But the point is that every kind of company that has product market fit should be able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3905.9s	3905.9	 to finance themselves non-dilutably in the B all the way to the D and the E.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3910.3s	3910.3	 And then the third thing, which is sort of what Friedberg says is this last bookend is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3914.4s	3914.4	 then you have sort of the path to going public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3917.3s	3917.3	 And this is where the SPAC makes a ton of sense because you have a very certain cost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3920.9s	3920.9	 of capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3921.9s	3921.9	 You can now architect a cap table where the founder remains in control, where they and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3925.6s	3925.6	 the employees are still more than 50%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3928.0s	3928.0	 And you pull in the time of the IPO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3929.9s	3929.9	 Why is that important?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3931.5s	3931.5	 Typically today, these companies were taking 12 plus years to go public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3935.3s	3935.3	 Now with SPACs, they've come back in and they're closer to seven and eight years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3939.6s	3939.6	 The reason is back to that argument of like, if you want to be a winner, take most outcome,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3944.8s	3944.8	 the most important thing you need at scale is money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3948.4s	3948.4	 And the way that you get money is by opening the kimono on your finances and showing people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3953.6s	3953.6	 who have lots of money why they should give it to you and not something else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3957.2s	3957.2	 And so by going public in year six, seven and eight, that's where you pull in the billions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3961.0s	3961.0	 of dollars so you can dominate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3962.9s	3962.9	 The board seeing is massive competition in the financing of massively competitive startup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3970.4s	3970.4	 scenes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3970.6s	3970.6	 In other words, the entrepreneurial ecosystem has never been this vibrant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3976.6s	3976.6	 And I want to point out one thing that the SEC has done that has is going to change things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3983.2s	3983.2	 dramatically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3983.9s	3983.9	 I believe when syndicates first came out, everybody said they were stupid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3987.4s	3987.4	 Nobody would ever do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3988.7s	3988.7	 First one we ever did famously was calm.com.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3990.8s	3990.8	 We put in $328,000 became worth over 100 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3994.0s	3994.0	 We're on track this year to do five deals a month, 60 deals, and we'll put 50 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=3999.1s	3999.1	 to work this year at the syndicate.com.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4001.2s	4001.2	 Think about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4001.8s	4001.8	 My fund is 44 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4003.1s	4003.1	 That's over three years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4004.0s	4004.0	 So now the syndicates got in so big that syndicate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4008.6s	4008.6	 Well, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4009.4s	4009.4	 So I'm going to tell my LP is the next time around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4011.6s	4011.6	 Let's have a discussion about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4012.6s	4012.6	 But anyway, I want to point out what republic.co happened this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4016.2s	4016.2	 Republic.co is equity crowdfunding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4018.1s	4018.1	 This means civilians can invest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4020.5s	4020.5	 There used to be a cap on an equity crowdfunding of $1 million every year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4024.7s	4024.7	 And there's a lot of auditing and financial review you have to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4028.2s	4028.2	 And you pay 6% to whoever raised the money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4030.6s	4030.6	 But it's it's there is no sponsor involved in this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4035.0s	4035.0	 So as an investor, you don't get me as a lead or Chamath as your sponsor or sacks on your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4040.6s	4040.6	 cap table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4042.0s	4042.0	 But you can go on to Republic now, which has 100,000 investors on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4048.6s	4048.6	 And Gumroad, which is doing $10 million a year just raised $5 million in one day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4053.6s	4053.6	 Sahil, who was also running a rolling fund with Angel List.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4057.3s	4057.3	 And he has 8,656 investors, which means people are putting in under $1,000 each.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4063.7s	4063.7	 Amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4064.6s	4064.6	 And it's capped at $5 million now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4067.2s	4067.2	 Then Arlen Hamilton, who runs Backstage Capital, did a very non-traditional, I'll say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4072.2s	4072.2	 raise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4072.8s	4072.8	 She's not raising for her fund.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4075.6s	4075.6	 She sold 10% ownership was in the process of selling 10% ownership in her venture capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4080.9s	4080.9	 fund startup studio at a $50 million valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4084.0s	4084.0	 She's selling 10% of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4085.1s	4085.1	 If you buy shares in that you don't get carry but you get 10% of her carry and management
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4091.0s	4091.0	 fees forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4091.9s	4091.9	 So it'd be like buying 10% of craft or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4094.9s	4094.9	 The point is, you the VCs get boxed out of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4099.7s	4099.7	 And this imagine if Airbnb or Uber decided fuck it, we're going to let our driver
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4105.5s	4105.5	 buy shares through this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4107.0s	4107.0	 And they said, we're starting this crowdfunding for 5 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4109.7s	4109.7	 And they did it every year because you can do the 5 million every single year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4114.0s	4114.0	 So every year you just allow folks who are in your stakeholder pool, you email them and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4119.4s	4119.4	 then they buy in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4120.3s	4120.3	 It's just absolutely extraordinary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4121.6s	4121.6	 Can you explain the Arlen thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4122.9s	4122.9	 So she's sorry, she sold 10% of what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4125.2s	4125.2	 It's a little complicated if you page down to the future earnings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4129.2s	4129.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4130.1s	4130.1	 So if you go to the flow of funds and that link I sent for public.co.s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4135.1s	4135.1	 She took all of her different funds and said you can buy 10% for $5 million you own 10%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4143.4s	4143.4	 of essentially Sequoia Capital or Y Combinator, whatever you want to refer to her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4149.1s	4149.1	 you know, company as her holding company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4151.6s	4151.6	 Then every time she gets management fees, every time she has distributions from her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4156.1s	4156.1	 carry, she's going to give 10% of that to these folks forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4159.6s	4159.6	 I don't know if that's a great idea, but it's a new idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4164.1s	4164.1	 I don't know if the investors in that are going to get a massive return or they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4167.3s	4167.3	 doing it because they want to support the cause.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4169.0s	4169.0	 That's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4170.0s	4170.0	 My gosh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4171.1s	4171.1	 It's so we're so disruptive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4172.7s	4172.7	 It's so disruptive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4173.7s	4173.7	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4174.0s	4174.0	 It's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4174.9s	4174.9	 Well, because it lets anybody really spin up a new venture firm basically, because there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4178.9s	4178.9	 are some startup costs to spinning up a new venture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4180.8s	4180.8	 Remember, she's been in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4181.8s	4181.8	 She's been doing this for 10 years and really has gotten good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4184.7s	4184.7	 I will have to say not a lot of traction, you know, from the classic LPs of the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4190.9s	4190.9	 But now, just like we saw a GameStop, just like we see with Bitcoin, just like we see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4196.1s	4196.1	 with NFTs and Robinhood day traders, there are new entrants here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4201.5s	4201.5	 And I think there's going to be a world where I will be able to fire up a syndicate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4206.6s	4206.6	 and say, I would like to raise 10 million, but I'm limiting it to $1,000 per person and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4212.4s	4212.4	 10,000 people invest, or I'm limiting it to $500.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4216.4s	4216.4	 So instead of, you know, going away for the weekend, or going to Vegas and blowing $1,000,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4221.4s	4221.4	 somebody could say, you know what, I'll go to Vegas and blow 500, but I'm gonna put 500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4224.7s	4224.7	 in the next startup, I see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4226.0s	4226.0	 And this is a democratization that could change everything and make America so much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4230.1s	4230.1	 more competitive with what we're seeing in China with Jack Ma disappearing and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4233.9s	4233.9	 Well, look, I've said this before, like, like, what's what's crazy is like, if you talk about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4238.4s	4238.4	 like, systemic inequality and poverty, it's like, the government loves to give poor people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4244.5s	4244.5	 casinos, sports betting and lottery tickets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4247.8s	4247.8	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4248.1s	4248.1	 But the idea that they could invest $100 into a startup is illegal, even though startups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4253.8s	4253.8	 generate 15% of your CAKR. So even if what you did was you generate you invested in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4258.1s	4258.1	 market beta of startups, let's just say that degrades, it would still probably be close to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4262.6s	4262.6	 10%. And so the markets, you'd be you'd be at the S&P returns, you know, over many, many years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4268.9s	4268.9	 8%. So I mean, 25% better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4272.1s	4272.1	 It's it would be incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4273.8s	4273.8	 With by the way, 25% better, Chamath with the outside chance of hitting a grand slam. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4280.3s	4280.3	 that's why I love this. All right. So do we want to wrap here? Anybody have any closing thoughts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4285.7s	4285.7	 Well, I just think it's like, if you think of like that thing of like, all the money flows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4289.9s	4289.9	 changing. The other thing is like, all the people are changing. And then what's that said before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4295.2s	4295.2	 it's much, much easier because the technologies are changing. You put these three things in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4299.2s	4299.2	 soup. And it just seems like our best days are ahead of us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4302.1s	4302.1	 I think it's going to be amazing for entrepreneurship. All the answers are out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4306.8s	4306.8	 If you want to start a company, all the skills are freely available to you. You can learn anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4312.4s	4312.4	 online. I think the message I really want people to understand is, you know, you may you may believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4319.2s	4319.2	 that the world is filled with inequality and racism, and bad actors, and you would be right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4326.4s	4326.4	 But what's also right is that every skill can be learned, capital is available now more than ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4333.6s	4333.6	 And there is a clear path for you. If you just stop watching television and learn to be a UX
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4338.8s	4338.8	 designer, a sales executive, a marketing or growth executive, or a developer, you can change the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4343.6s	4343.6	 world and change your lot in life and be really fucking rich. Don't buy into this victim mentality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4349.6s	4349.6	 It's complete utter nonsense that crazy lefties are saying everybody's stupid and nobody can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4355.4s	4355.4	 learn. And I got a bag of red pills here. And I have been pounding them. The world is a giant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4361.6s	4361.6	 opportunity for all of you. Go get it. I think it's time to announce. Friedberg and I would like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4366.5s	4366.5	 to announce that we've started a combination incubator and early stage venture firm. We call
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4373.3s	4373.3	 it Paunch Draft. And it's play on the words launch and craft. I think the Paunch is more just an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4382.0s	4382.0	 homage to you. Everybody wants to know when we're going to launch our first syndicate. We got to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4385.1s	4385.1	 get a deal here. Somebody's got to find a deal with a thousand, with a million left. I never get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4388.4s	4388.4	 the phone calls. You guys are doing deals left and right. Jason, you need to assign somebody to figure

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVLyPwJAZQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=110&t=4399.2s	4399.2	 businesses. What we should commit to them is we will help you be the least deluded, and we will
