https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=0.0s	0.0	 J. Cal, what's it feel like to be a guest on your own podcast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2.8s	2.8	 today? I'm excited. So delightful. You did a great job,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5.9s	5.9	 by the way. Really like the punch up to the formatting where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=8.8s	8.8	 you actually put the questions in. Yeah, I think it's because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=11.1s	11.1	 they want us to all agree on the stuff we want to grok on, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=13.6s	13.6	 know, in a professional TV show, they would have pre interviews
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=16.5s	16.5	 with everybody get all their positions, then they put the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=19.3s	19.3	 positions into the document. And they, you know, they basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=22.4s	22.4	 do what was called a pre interview.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=24.0s	24.0	 Or here's another idea, you could do your job. Well, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=26.6s	26.6	 mean, how about that? How about you try that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=30.6s	30.6	 Or how about I turned you three miserable into actual likeable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=34.2s	34.2	 people in 91 episodes, which nobody thought was possible. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=38.0s	38.0	 actually think I'm becoming less likable the longer I'm on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=40.6s	40.6	 show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=42.8s	42.8	 I think that correlates with all of us. All of our likability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=46.9s	46.9	 is just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=56.4s	56.4	 going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=65.6s	65.6	 Hello, and welcome to the all in pod. I am your moderator for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=69.6s	69.6	 today out of the hot seat. Doing the easy beat Dave Friedberg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=74.8s	74.8	 I'm joined today by our esteemed panel. Back from his European

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=86.8s	86.8	 great. You're okay. You're recovered. Yeah, I'm a little I've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=90.0s	90.0	 got I got a little head cold though. Oh, well, sorry to hear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=92.8s	92.8	 that. Hope it's not COVID 2.0. No, I tested on COVID negative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=96.5s	96.5	 Thank God. Okay. Also with us as usual from his emergency bunker

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=105.0s	105.0	 you David? Good. Happy with the late start this morning, I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=108.2s	108.2	 sure. And of course, everyone's favorite ski bum, producer of

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=118.5s	118.5	 guestie today? Oh, it's so delightful when you said you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=122.1s	122.1	 wanted to moderate that to me was chef's kiss I get to I get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=125.7s	125.7	 to comment and not be the moderator. I love it. Yeah, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=129.2s	129.2	 we're mixing it up a little bit today. I'm gonna take the lead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=131.8s	131.8	 Jay Cal is gonna sit back. I'll say a couple of words before we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=135.4s	135.4	 start because I think last week we got a little nasty. Definitely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=139.1s	139.1	 heard that from listeners. You know, I know. And so I want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=142.4s	142.4	 kind of just address it real quick. And then we can kick off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=145.4s	145.4	 the show. I think it's important to say that none of us really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=147.7s	147.7	 started out doing this pod as a job or thinking that it would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=151.6s	151.6	 become a real regular thing, right? We started doing it for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=154.2s	154.2	 fun ad hoc from time to time. And then it became this thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=158.0s	158.0	 that people listen to and it became this thing that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=159.7s	159.7	 started doing every week and people actually cared about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=161.8s	161.8	 and suddenly became this real obligation. It's almost like we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=165.4s	165.4	 got pregnant and had a baby. And now it's like four men and a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=168.2s	168.2	 baby. And so you know, I think we all feel this like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=172.0s	172.0	 challenging obligation that we never expected to take on of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=175.0s	175.0	 like taking care of the show taking care of the pod. And we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=178.3s	178.3	 all have like different points of view on what we want the pod
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=180.5s	180.5	 to be and what we want it to become. Jay Cal cares about, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=184.0s	184.0	 know, getting up in the rankings and listening to the audience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=187.0s	187.0	 and ultimately has shared that he wants to monetize, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=190.7s	190.7	 at points. We've not always agreed on different points about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=193.4s	193.4	 that, you know, to Moth has the things he wants to bring to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=195.6s	195.6	 table, Sax says things he wants to talk about. And so, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=199.2s	199.2	 it's really difficult kind of running the pod managing the pod
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=202.5s	202.5	 with four very different points of view, very different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=204.5s	204.5	 perspectives on what it is we all want to kind of get out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=207.6s	207.6	 this over time. And I think it causes us to get really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=210.4s	210.4	 frustrated with each other. We end up having real fights. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=215.1s	215.1	 know, you have the biggest fights with your best friends,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=217.3s	217.3	 you know, you really let loose and lash out. I think last week,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=221.3s	221.3	 I listened back, I was pretty contemptuous in my kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=224.4s	224.4	 retort to Jay Cal about hitting up on the inflation topic. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=227.2s	227.2	 want to apologize to Jay Cal for doing that. I think it was, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=231.5s	231.5	 know, I think, yeah, I think it was a little rough. But at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=234.1s	234.1	 same time, I just want to point out, like, you know, we're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=236.3s	236.3	 to keep doing the show. Because I think, you know, as much as we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=240.0s	240.0	 all disagree, as much as we fight, and as much as we may
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=242.9s	242.9	 even start to dislike each other, and not get along, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=246.3s	246.3	 think it's really important that we keep doing this. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=248.3s	248.3	 think, restating that commitment and trying to do better is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=252.4s	252.4	 really important. So you know, we're going to try different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=254.3s	254.3	 stuff out, try and find ways to find common ground and keep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=256.6s	256.6	 doing the show productively with each other. As one experiment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=260.6s	260.6	 this week, I'm going to moderate and we're going to, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=262.4s	262.4	 try and take it that way. But you know, I just wanted to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=264.9s	264.9	 those few words before we kick this off, guys, because I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=266.8s	266.8	 thought it was important, especially after the last couple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=269.1s	269.1	 of weeks, I think it's been a bit of a struggle. We've been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=271.3s	271.3	 having a tough time. And I just want to be open about it. And,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=273.9s	273.9	 you know, highlight that, you know, as an example, you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=277.4s	277.4	 fight with people, you can disagree with them, and you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=279.7s	279.7	 still keep trying. And I want to set that example, I want us to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=282.7s	282.7	 keep doing that. So anyway, just thought that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=285.4s	285.4	 I would just like to say, apology accepted. And I thought
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=290.4s	290.4	 that was a lovely opening. One thing I would just punch up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=294.0s	294.0	 there is, the real reason we did this was because we missed each
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=297.4s	297.4	 other, we missed hanging out with each other. And then this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=301.5s	301.5	 is, you know, something that's become more successful than any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=304.5s	304.5	 of us ever imagined. It's got an audience size that is just, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=310.8s	310.8	 know, hard to imagine how many people are listening to this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=313.9s	313.9	 which then does put a little bit of pressure on it, we want it to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=316.4s	316.4	 be great for the audience. And I just want to say, like, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=320.1s	320.1	 take it personally, when we when we battle on stuff, even with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=322.8s	322.8	 politics and sacks and stuff like that. I respect each of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=326.0s	326.0	 you, you are each brothers to me, I love each of you deeply.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=330.4s	330.4	 And when we fight and things don't work out, I look at it as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=333.5s	333.5	 like personal growth or progress towards some other goals that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=337.0s	337.0	 each have the amount of support I've gotten in my career, from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=342.2s	342.2	 David sacks and Shama has been unparalleled. David sacks was my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=347.7s	347.7	 first LP, he encouraged me to create my first venture fund.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=351.7s	351.7	 Shama supported supported me relentlessly in my career, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=354.9s	354.9	 showed up for me every event I ever did. And I tried to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=357.8s	357.8	 those same things for them. You and I haven't done much business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=360.9s	360.9	 together Freiburg, but I'm enjoying the business that we've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=364.1s	364.1	 started to do. Yeah, sorry to and I showed up for both of your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=368.0s	368.0	 events when you needed me. Yeah, doing some syndicates with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=371.2s	371.2	 And I love doing this each week. I love doing this each week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=374.3s	374.3	 Yeah, it's like, like, I think my point was, it's a lot easier to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=376.7s	376.7	 be friends and have wine together and play poker together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=380.7s	380.7	 than it is to do a job together. And this has become really a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=383.5s	383.5	 job. And so you know, you can have really good friends, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=386.5s	386.5	 you try and start a company together or do a job together,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=388.8s	388.8	 and you can hate each other. I think it doesn't mean that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=391.7s	391.7	 guys stop being friends or that we should stop doing the work. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=394.2s	394.2	 think we should still keep trying to do the work, figure out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=396.4s	396.4	 a way to make it work. So anyway, that was the point I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=398.7s	398.7	 wanted to make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=399.2s	399.2	 And that's the end of my my statements. Okay, those weren't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=402.0s	402.0	 prepared. Those are just a reaction to yours. I don't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=403.8s	403.8	 if I say anything, but I doubt it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=407.0s	407.0	 Okay, let's see how many emotions right now. Sacked, what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=409.8s	409.8	 are you feeling?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=410.5s	410.5	 Yeah, I mean, some of you think grass fed is better or the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=414.9s	414.9	 regular build.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=418.3s	418.3	 Saxon, I were texting while you guys were were hugging it out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=422.1s	422.1	 talking about different kinds of jerky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=426.5s	426.5	 While we were jerking each other off, you guys were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=428.4s	428.4	 researching jerky. Great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=430.8s	430.8	 I was recommending Bill Tom to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=432.9s	432.9	 Oh, great. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=433.8s	433.8	 Speaking of jerky, let's get into Adam Newman. Okay, so now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=436.5s	436.5	 Hey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=436.9s	436.9	 Hello.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=438.0s	438.0	 Okay, so first thing to talk about today, and I kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=441.6s	441.6	 wanted to take it in a little bit of a different direction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=444.2s	444.2	 that I think all the other tech media have kind of addressed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=447.0s	447.0	 this. You know, Adam Newman is back, he raised $350 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=450.6s	450.6	 from Andreessen Horowitz. There was announcement this week for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=454.7s	454.7	 his new company called Flow, which as we understand it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=457.5s	457.5	 trying to develop residential apartments, you know, in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=462.2s	462.2	 same sort of vibe, quality, and attention to experience as maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=467.5s	467.5	 was intended with WeWork. And Flow, you know, seems to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=472.8s	472.8	 started originated with Adam doing a bunch of acquisitions of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=475.8s	475.8	 real estate with his own capital. And now he seems to have turned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=478.6s	478.6	 this into a real business and raise money from Andreessen. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=480.8s	480.8	 there's all the commentary and joking about Andreessen putting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=487.0s	487.0	 this money in. Are they crazy? As well as all the, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=489.9s	489.9	 commentary about Adam Newman? How could anyone back him? The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=492.4s	492.4	 guy was so awful the first time around. Let me just do a quick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=495.2s	495.2	 round the horn with you guys, you know, initial reactions to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=499.8s	499.8	 the Adam Newman deal. And then I'd love to talk about founders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=503.1s	503.1	 having a second act. Because, you know, Adam happens to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=507.2s	507.2	 high profile. So his failure was high profile. But a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=511.6s	511.6	 founders have a failed, low profile first experience and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=515.6s	515.6	 come back and kick ass the second time around. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=518.2s	518.2	 investors have taken notice of that. And so I'd love to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=521.2s	521.2	 there. But maybe we just do a quick reaction. J. Cal, I know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=523.2s	523.2	 you've talked about this on your other show. Maybe you can kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=525.5s	525.5	 of give us your quick commentary on the opportunity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=529.1s	529.1	 to transact. And what are people talking about with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=531.1s	531.1	 respect to this this deal happening?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=532.7s	532.7	 You know, people are wondering why he's able to raise money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=534.8s	534.8	 And what I always tell founders is when you see these like weird
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=537.9s	537.9	 fundings, and you can't get your heads around them. It's typically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=540.6s	540.6	 has to do with track record and credible audacity, Trump's prior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=544.4s	544.4	 blunders. So say what you will about Adam Newman, he is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=549.1s	549.1	 audacious, and he has credibility. People forget his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=551.8s	551.8	 origin story. They only remember the Masa Yoshisan $4 billion,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=555.9s	555.9	 and what happened and what he did with that. And that was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=558.3s	558.3	 complete clusterfuck. It went off the rails, he did all kinds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=561.4s	561.4	 of inside dealing and it was it was madness. But before that, he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=566.0s	566.0	 did green desk, he was a bootstrapped entrepreneur. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=568.9s	568.9	 then he created the category defining co working space, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=573.1s	573.1	 to this day, when you say I need to get an office, the first thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=575.9s	575.9	 people say is get a we were just like they say taken Uber, just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=578.6s	578.6	 like they say Google it, just like, you know, any other verb
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=582.4s	582.4	 that we talk about. And so it's very easy to dismiss him and say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=586.8s	586.8	 the tech industry has no morals, they just back they'll back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=589.0s	589.0	 anybody. He has a publicly traded company that's in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=593.2s	593.2	 market right now, he defined the category and he also put $300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=596.0s	596.0	 million, apparently of his own money at stake to buy these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=599.0s	599.0	 apartments. So I think it's I would say the bet makes sense to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=604.5s	604.5	 me. And I think it will make sense if we go into the bet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=608.1s	608.1	 which I'd love to hear everybody else's thoughts on. It's an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=610.2s	610.2	 audacious bet, because housing is one of the hardest industries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=614.2s	614.2	 to tackle. And he already did it for commercial. So why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=618.4s	618.4	 wouldn't he be able to do it for residential?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=620.5s	620.5	 Sacks, did you see this opportunity in the market? Didn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=622.8s	622.8	 did you guys take a look at it or have any points of view on it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=625.6s	625.6	 No, I mean, we, we don't write $350 million size checks. So it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=630.0s	630.0	 just not something that we're going to take a look at. For
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=632.4s	632.4	 that matter, we don't really do non software investments, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=636.2s	636.2	 don't do, you know, in the physical world type investments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=640.8s	640.8	 And I've kind of learned that doing anything in the physical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=643.7s	643.7	 world with atoms is 10 times harder than doing anything with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=646.9s	646.9	 bits. So you know, one of my takeaways over the last few
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=650.0s	650.0	 years is, you know, we tend to like pure software models, not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=654.2s	654.2	 even hybrid or tech enabled models, because it really does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=658.3s	658.3	 take a 10x entrepreneur to do anything in the physical world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=662.3s	662.3	 So we you know, we software is kind of our knitting and we like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=666.8s	666.8	 to stick to that. In terms of, you know, Andreessen Horowitz
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=670.2s	670.2	 making this investment, here's your larger topic of repeat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=674.0s	674.0	 founders. Look, most startups fail. And most founders or good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=678.3s	678.3	 founders have an entrepreneurial streak in them. And so you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=681.2s	681.2	 combine those two things, and there's gonna be a lot of repeat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=683.8s	683.8	 second time founders, people who are fundamentally entrepreneurial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=687.0s	687.0	 and their first thing doesn't work out. I think that that can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=690.0s	690.0	 be a positive thing to invest in, because they've gotten some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=693.5s	693.5	 of their mistakes out of the way, and they've learned from that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=695.6s	695.6	 experience. So I think the question we would just ask is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=698.8s	698.8	 what were the learnings? And did they conduct their failed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=701.8s	701.8	 startup honorably? You know, like if they lie to investors or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=705.8s	705.8	 misled investors, then obviously, we don't want any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=708.3s	708.3	 part of that. But I don't think most failures are like that. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=713.2s	713.2	 and so as long as the founder, I think conducted themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=716.1s	716.1	 honorably had some good learnings, it's certainly not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=718.9s	718.9	 disqualifier for their next startup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=720.7s	720.7	 I mean, Chamath, you've been open in the past about startups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=724.4s	724.4	 that waste money and do the kind bars and red brick, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=728.2s	728.2	 offices and you know, easy living at the office. There's no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=731.7s	731.7	 better example of over the top exuberance as there was at WeWork
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=736.0s	736.0	 right? I mean, does that indicate to you that this guy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=738.6s	738.6	 doesn't have a clue in terms of how to be prudent with investors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=742.2s	742.2	 capital and it's not backable? Or how do you think about it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=745.0s	745.0	 I have a couple thoughts. The first is that WeWork is a really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=749.8s	749.8	 interesting business. But that business had been built many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=753.6s	753.6	 times before and it's called the REIT. And I think what Adam was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=758.3s	758.3	 able to arbitrage was a period of time where he pitched a non
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=762.7s	762.7	 real estate investor, a technology company that was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=766.3s	766.3	 really just a real estate investment trust. And that's why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=770.3s	770.3	 he was able to get these incredibly heady valuations. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=773.0s	773.0	 think the peak valuation of WeWork was like 45 or $50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=775.6s	775.6	 billion. But what happened, which is that when we work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=779.4s	779.4	 ultimately went public, the collective intelligence of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=783.0s	783.0	 public markets imposed a REIT based valuation model on WeWork
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=788.8s	788.8	 and it is now a $3.6 billion public company. And I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=794.6s	794.6	 think you can dunk on Adam for that it's hard to build any kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=797.8s	797.8	 of company, let alone a $3.6 billion company and he was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=801.1s	801.1	 instrumental in that so he should get some amount of credit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=804.4s	804.4	 But the reality was that he was pitching people that didn't want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=807.7s	807.7	 to hear about a business that was a real estate investment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=812.0s	812.0	 trust, they wanted to hear about some technology and all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=814.9s	814.9	 these other things. But ultimately, when you stripped it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=816.8s	816.8	 away, it was a REIT. Now you started again, and from the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=821.2s	821.2	 outside in not knowing anything, because we don't know anything,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=824.6s	824.6	 what it looks like is the beginnings of another REIT
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=827.6s	827.6	 except focused on residential, right? So when you buy hundreds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=831.2s	831.2	 or 1000s of apartments, but again, same pig, different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=835.0s	835.0	 lipstick, the the the issue at hand though, is that again, he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=839.4s	839.4	 has found a technology investor to buy a technology story. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=844.4s	844.4	 again, time will tell whether there is a technology business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=846.9s	846.9	 here. But if it ultimately is an amalgamation of a bunch of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=850.6s	850.6	 apartments, with some sort of, you know, interconnected
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=855.4s	855.4	 technology that helps enable a better community or what have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=858.4s	858.4	 you, those kinds of REITs have also been built before and REITs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=862.7s	862.7	 are valued in a very structured way on this thing called FFO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=866.4s	866.4	 funds from operations. And you know what the upper bound
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=870.4s	870.4	 evaluation is, which is if you go and you know, look in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=872.8s	872.8	 stock market, the most valuable REIT in the world is a company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=876.1s	876.1	 called Prologis. They have about a billion square feet under
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=879.7s	879.7	 management, they're about $100 billion company, we work has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=883.3s	883.3	 about 45 million square feet under management, there are $3.6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=887.2s	887.2	 billion company. So if you just interpolate from those two data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=890.6s	890.6	 points, on the residential side, Adam's gonna have to buy you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=894.1s	894.1	 know, if you think an average apartment is 1500 square feet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=896.4s	896.4	 he has to buy, you know, 665,000 more apartments in order for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=903.0s	903.0	 that to be prologic scale, you know, I don't know to invest at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=905.9s	905.9	 a billion dollar valuation, or 1.5 or two, or whatever that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=910.3s	910.3	 number turns out to be, makes sense if you think the upper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=913.4s	913.4	 bound is unlimited. But if you think the upper bound is three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=915.4s	915.4	 or 4 billion, the only reason to do it, by the way, it still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=918.6s	918.6	 makes sense for unreasoned to do it. And this is why I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=921.4s	921.4	 people get tilted. Because now this comes to my second point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=925.6s	925.6	 which is that what Adam Newman is able to take advantage of is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=929.8s	929.8	 very obvious, powerful understanding of the venture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=934.4s	934.4	 capital business model that other founders don't, especially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=937.8s	937.8	 the ones that dunk on him. And let me just explain this. We
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=942.1s	942.1	 talked about this last week, the only mistake I think that soft
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=945.6s	945.6	 bank really made was a velocity of money mistake, which is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=950.2s	950.2	 setting the investment cycle of their vision fund to be 10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=953.1s	953.1	 years instead of five. Well, every other fund has a five year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=957.0s	957.0	 investment cycle to including a H's. And so when you have 10s of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=960.8s	960.8	 billions of dollars under management, guys, guess what,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=963.4s	963.4	 they have the same problem soft bank did, except with just a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=966.9s	966.9	 different quantum of capital, they want velocity of money. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=971.6s	971.6	 so if a founder comes and asks for $350 million, it actually in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=976.5s	976.5	 a perverse way makes your life easier. Because now that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=979.9s	979.9	 saying yes once, versus saying five or six times to people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=983.8s	983.8	 asking for $50 million, or heaven forbid 350 times for people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=988.1s	988.1	 asking for $1 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=989.6s	989.6	 And so if you're if you're in that seat, come up if you're in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=992.3s	992.3	 the investor seat, are you putting all that capital once
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=996.5s	996.5	 with the one guy who's managed that money before? Or do you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=999.8s	999.8	 want to find the guy who has it or the gal who has it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1002.8s	1002.8	 You have to understand the Andreessen business model and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1005.0s	1005.0	 recent Horowitz business model is to become Blackstone. But for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1009.3s	1009.3	 technology, it had like 30 billion AUM now, right? Right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1012.6s	1012.6	 which is still, you know, a drop in the bucket. So if you look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1016.3s	1016.3	 Blackstone, right, a trillion, Blackstone is 100 plus billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1019.5s	1019.5	 dollar market cap company, right built on three pillars, credit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1024.2s	1024.2	 private equity and real estate, you can make the argument that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1027.6s	1027.6	 technology is near is as important as those three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1030.4s	1030.4	 categories. And so you know, if I think it's pretty obvious that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1034.8s	1034.8	 Andreessen is trying to build a publicly ownable security that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1040.2s	1040.2	 represents all things in technology. So again, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1043.8s	1043.8	 think that they're necessarily out to generate massive returns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1047.6s	1047.6	 for LPs. They want to become a credible, reliable institution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1053.6s	1053.6	 for to absorb hundreds of billions of dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1057.2s	1057.2	 So ultimately, the objective, you think is to monetize their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1061.5s	1061.5	 ultimate goal is to is for Andreessen and Horowitz to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1065.1s	1065.1	 monetize the equity of Andreessen Horowitz of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1067.8s	1067.8	 management company. Yeah, that's the goal. And that's a that's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1070.5s	1070.5	 by the way, that's a laudable goal. It's really hard to build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1073.0s	1073.0	 a business. They've built an incredible business, and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1075.7s	1075.7	 they should get credit for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1077.3s	1077.3	 Sachs, do you agree?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1078.1s	1078.1	 Well, I mean, they are they I think Chamath's right that their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1081.9s	1081.9	 stated goal is to build like a larger institutional VC type
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1087.3s	1087.3	 investor. I mean, doesn't Andreessen have a portrait of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1090.4s	1090.4	 JP Morgan hanging on his wall or something? I mean, they want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1092.9s	1092.9	 turn VC from being like a little craft business is something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1096.8s	1096.8	 larger, more institutional. So yeah, I'm sure they jump at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1099.6s	1099.6	 chance to write a $350 million check if they believe in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1102.5s	1102.5	 company. But can I shift this conversation just for a second?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1105.4s	1105.4	 So I've done a lot of commercial real estate investing. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1107.9s	1107.9	 there are reasons to think that flow this new company could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1111.6s	1111.6	 actually be better than WeWork. And let me just explain. So with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1115.3s	1115.3	 WeWork, you know, if you talk to commercial office space,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1119.9s	1119.9	 owners, landlords, about WeWork, like 10 years ago, what they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1123.3s	1123.3	 would have told you is, yeah, look, that model is great. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1127.2s	1127.2	 we want tenants who are high credit and sign long term leases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1132.0s	1132.0	 Why? Because they're not worried about what happens in a bull
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1135.3s	1135.3	 market, they're worried about what happens in a recession. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1137.7s	1137.7	 they want to make sure they can cover their bank debt. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1141.1s	1141.1	 landlords have always cared not just about rents, but also about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1144.6s	1144.6	 having high credit long term leases. What WeWork basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1149.6s	1149.6	 did is arbitrage that of course, it was a much better deal for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1152.5s	1152.5	 startups. Because if you're a startup, you don't have to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1154.9s	1154.9	 through a complicated process to sign a lease, you could just go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1157.4s	1157.4	 month to month at a WeWork and you'd be willing to pay a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1160.1s	1160.1	 premium for that. So WeWork's business worked great during an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1163.3s	1163.3	 upmarket because they would rent space for say, 50 bucks a foot,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1166.4s	1166.4	 lease it for 100 and they would capture the spread. The problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1169.4s	1169.4	 is the business was highly levered to a boom cycle. And at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1174.1s	1174.1	 the first recession or bust cycle, all of a sudden, they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1176.9s	1176.9	 going to have massive vacancy because everyone can leave. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1179.7s	1179.7	 all of a sudden, their rents go below their, the rents are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1182.8s	1182.8	 collecting go below the rent, they're paying and the arbitrage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1185.4s	1185.4	 goes away. They magnified that problem by making two mistakes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1188.3s	1188.3	 Number one, they signed a lot of top of market leases, right? They
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1191.2s	1191.2	 were signing leases at $100 plus per foot in hot markets. And the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1195.2s	1195.2	 other thing is they didn't seem to have a lot of financial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1196.8s	1196.8	 discipline. You know, I guess that show kind of makes fun of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1201.8s	1201.8	 these sort of Bacchanalian parties they had and so forth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1203.9s	1203.9	 like that you can get away with a lack of spending discipline if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1207.6s	1207.6	 you're a 90% gross margin business like a Google but when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1211.4s	1211.4	 you're a real estate business, who's got real cogs, not having
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1214.8s	1214.8	 spending discipline is actually a problem. So for all those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1218.6s	1218.6	 reasons, I think WeWork kind of contain the seeds of its own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1221.6s	1221.6	 implosion inside of their model and they needed to manage or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1225.7s	1225.7	 mitigate those risks a lot better. That's not to say though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1228.6s	1228.6	 that it wasn't a great product. I mean, for every start, it was an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1231.6s	1231.6	 amazing product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1232.4s	1232.4	 Yeah, I mean, in the early days, to your point, they were taking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1237.7s	1237.7	 under market like really low cost per square foot space like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1241.5s	1241.5	 in the tenderloin, and then selling it for, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1244.7s	1244.7	 Bryant and third street rents, right? I mean, that was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1249.0s	1249.0	 arbitrage and it worked. It's only they lost that discipline
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1252.5s	1252.5	 sounds like in the second half of the company's history, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1255.0s	1255.0	 What I think is interesting about flow is that it's sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1257.7s	1257.7	 multifamily these apartment type buildings, those tend to be, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1261.6s	1261.6	 know, let's call it one year leases anyway, and they're owning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1264.0s	1264.0	 them. They're not leasing from a landlord. They're basically so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1267.0s	1267.0	 Chamath's right, it's basically a standard apartment replay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1270.1s	1270.1	 where Newman is going to create a consistent experience and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1273.4s	1273.4	 brand across the country. I'm not sure that's really been done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1276.2s	1276.2	 before where there's like a brand for apartment living.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1279.2s	1279.2	 It's never been done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1280.2s	1280.2	 Yeah. And so actually, it's pretty simple in terms of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1283.1s	1283.1	 measuring if it's going to work or not, which is simply can Adam
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1286.1s	1286.1	 Newman deliver lower vacancy rates and higher rents, and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1290.0s	1290.0	 you know, buy apartment buildings at market prices. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1293.3s	1293.3	 in other words, that's the arbitrage is can he extract more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1297.2s	1297.2	 rent and less vacancy from apartment units by creating this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1300.3s	1300.3	 national brand? And this experience? But this is this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1303.7s	1303.7	 we do a financial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1305.6s	1305.6	 Yeah, go ahead. This is my point. Everything you talked about is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1307.8s	1307.8	 how we would actually do a teardown of any other REIT that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1311.4s	1311.4	 was looking for money, David, you know, we would look at what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1313.7s	1313.7	 is the FFO. Ultimately, it's like, you know, what's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1316.6s	1316.6	 implied cap rate? What's the FFO? Can you get paid for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1319.5s	1319.5	 how much you have to spend? And can you get paid?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1321.6s	1321.6	 And this is where this is where I think like, you know, trying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1323.8s	1323.8	 to then, you know, so if if on the if on the inside of it, what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1329.2s	1329.2	 instead it was not that, but it was pitched as some, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1333.0s	1333.0	 convoluted technology play, it's a little bit harder to believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1336.0s	1336.0	 again, we don't know the details. So maybe this play,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1339.0s	1339.0	 I'm sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1340.7s	1340.7	 what I would say building on Sachs and schmutz, if they are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1343.8s	1343.8	 going to do 700,000 apartments, you can actually put some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1345.8s	1345.8	 numbers on this, you know, 700,000 apartments, you think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1348.9s	1348.9	 they can get extra 100, maybe 150 bucks out of a renter, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1352.5s	1352.5	 think they could for like that experience, right? People pay a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1354.6s	1354.6	 little bit, they're not going to pay 300 more 400 more, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1357.8s	1357.8	 then they would just get a larger apartment. And you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1359.7s	1359.7	 they could spend that money because it would be better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1362.2s	1362.2	 spent. They have 700,000 of those you're talking about a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1364.6s	1364.6	 billion dollars in revenue a year. That's what 700,000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1367.2s	1367.2	 apartments. Okay, 10 times profits, you know, whatever $10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1370.6s	1370.6	 billion valuation if interest in hearts is buying in at 1.5 or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1373.8s	1373.8	 two, like your mouth saying is probably correct. Somewhere in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1376.1s	1376.1	 that range, they bought 20%. Okay, yeah, maybe they get a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1378.6s	1378.6	 six or seven bagger out of this. But it's a six or seven bagger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1381.3s	1381.3	 on a big number 350. It's not like a 20 x or a 50 x and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1385.5s	1385.5	 also get the branding which I would not under value here of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1391.0s	1391.0	 being the firm that backs bad boy, entrepreneurs, and is like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1396.3s	1396.3	 willing to go there and support.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1398.8s	1398.8	 I think it's a real positive for Andreessen. It's like, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1401.5s	1401.5	 yeah, I do. You know, you just raised a ton of money. Well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1404.4s	1404.4	 guess what, you got to put that money out because it's not as if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1406.7s	1406.7	 they're going to think to themselves, oh, I really only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1409.3s	1409.3	 want to run this fund over three years instead of two. They're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1412.5s	1412.5	 not thinking that they're like, I want to keep going out because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1415.4s	1415.4	 I think their business model works by taking as much oxygen in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1419.6s	1419.6	 the room as possible, which means to be actively fundraising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1423.4s	1423.4	 always. That's it's tied. It's true of Blackstone. It's true of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1427.4s	1427.4	 Apollo. It's true of Carlisle. It's true of KKR. Any of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1431.9s	1431.9	 publicly traded investment managers, they live and die by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1438.0s	1438.0	 their ability to constantly be raising funds, which implicitly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1441.6s	1441.6	 means you have to constantly be writing funds, the returns decay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1445.8s	1445.8	 but that's okay, because now you're feeding your you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1448.8s	1448.8	 you're taking money from pension funds and other institutional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1451.4s	1451.4	 limited partners who are fine, because their hurdle is like six
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1455.4s	1455.4	 or 7%. So if you deliver 11%, you still look like a genius,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1459.6s	1459.6	 because you can absorb so much money. So Andreessen wins by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1463.1s	1463.1	 showing that Adam Newman goes and picks him. And recent wins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1466.8s	1466.8	 because they have the ability to write a $350 million check. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1471.0s	1471.0	 recent wins because they have $350 million less that they have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1474.5s	1474.5	 to actually put into the hands of other entrepreneurs. Now they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1477.1s	1477.1	 can do it with just one check. So it's a multifaceted win for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1480.4s	1480.4	 them. And it's a multifaceted win for Newman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1483.4s	1483.4	 I think there's also brand value for the entrepreneurs that have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1487.3s	1487.3	 had failed startups or issues with their first startup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1489.9s	1489.9	 imploding, and knowing that there's still a second bite at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1492.6s	1492.6	 the apple. I remember a survey and I just tried to pull it up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1495.5s	1495.5	 but I couldn't find it. So I may be wrong on this. But first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1499.0s	1499.0	 round capital years ago surveyed, or did an analysis of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1503.7s	1503.7	 all the investments they had made. And I think one of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1506.1s	1506.1	 biggest predictors of success in a startup was that it was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1508.8s	1508.8	 founders second startup. And so if you've had failings the first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1513.2s	1513.2	 time around, you're more likely to have learned from those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1515.9s	1515.9	 failings to improve your performance the second time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1518.0s	1518.0	 around. And so as an entrepreneur, I looked at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1520.5s	1520.5	 Andreessen Horowitz after this investment and think, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1523.5s	1523.5	 these guys will still back, you know, great entrepreneurs, even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1527.0s	1527.0	 if things went sideways, or there was an issue the first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1529.0s	1529.0	 time. And you've got, you know, the ultimate kind of case for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1531.6s	1531.6	 that. Okay, speaking of Andreessen, I'm going to move us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1534.0s	1534.0	 along. You guys wanted to cover this topic, not my favorite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1536.9s	1536.9	 topic, just because I want to be careful about you guys decide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1542.7s	1542.7	 what you want to say. But I'm going to bring up the the Andreessen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1545.8s	1545.8	 NIMBYism thing and after 10, you guys wanted to cover this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1549.0s	1549.0	 right? Yeah, thumbs up. Sure. I mean, I mean, it's like, okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1555.0s	1555.0	 well, I mean, everybody's talking about why wouldn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1557.0s	1557.0	 everyone's talking about it. Okay, so during COVID, during
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1560.2s	1560.2	 COVID, Mark Andreessen wrote a an essay called build. And I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1566.0s	1566.0	 going to read an excerpt. He says you don't just see the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1567.8s	1567.8	 smug complacency, the satisfaction with the status
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1570.5s	1570.5	 quo, and the unwillingness to build in the pandemic or in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1573.6s	1573.6	 health care. Generally, you see it throughout Western life and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1576.8s	1576.8	 specifically throughout American life, you see it in housing and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1580.6s	1580.6	 the physical footprint of our cities, we can't build nearly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1583.4s	1583.4	 enough housing in our cities with surging economic potential,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1586.1s	1586.1	 which results in crazily skyrocketing housing prices in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1589.6s	1589.6	 places like San Francisco, making it nearly impossible for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1592.1s	1592.1	 regular people to move in and take the jobs of the future. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1595.6s	1595.6	 then last week, Mark and his wife, Laura submitted a letter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1600.1s	1600.1	 to the town of Atherton to fight against multifamily housing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1605.5s	1605.5	 saying I'm writing this letter to communicate our immense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1607.9s	1607.9	 objection to the creation of multifamily overlay zones in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1611.2s	1611.2	 Atherton, please immediately remove all multifamily overlay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1614.4s	1614.4	 zoning projects from the housing element, which will be submitted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1616.5s	1616.5	 to the state in July, they will massively decrease our home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1619.3s	1619.3	 values, the quality of life ourselves and our neighbors, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1622.3s	1622.3	 immensely increase the noise pollution and traffic. Saks. I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1628.8s	1628.8	 just gonna hand the mic over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1630.1s	1630.1	 Well, I mean, I'm happy to defend the residents of Atherton on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1635.0s	1635.0	 this, I'm going to take the contrarian standpoint, but does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1637.6s	1637.6	 anyone?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1637.9s	1637.9	 I was gonna do the same. I thought you guys were all gonna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1639.8s	1639.8	 match them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1640.3s	1640.3	 So, go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1641.1s	1641.1	 Well, look, I mean, do we have a problem where housing is too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1645.8s	1645.8	 hard to construct in the state of California? Yes. And there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1648.8s	1648.8	 bunch of reasons for that. The permitting process is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1651.3s	1651.3	 Byzantine, it takes years, all those delays cost money, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1654.9s	1654.9	 tenant rights movement has gone so far that landlords basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1658.8s	1658.8	 can't, it's almost impossible to evict anybody. And that makes it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1662.8s	1662.8	 so no one wants to be a landlord, no one wants to build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1665.8s	1665.8	 these multifamily buildings, or buy them. And then you've got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1671.8s	1671.8	 like all these taxes. So, you're just in California, in San
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1675.7s	1675.7	 Francisco, for example, they just passed a 6% transfer tax,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1678.8s	1678.8	 where if we talked about this on the show, they basically just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1680.9s	1680.9	 took 6% of my home, and there's like nothing you can do about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1684.0s	1684.0	 it. So, there's a lot of reasons why people don't want to invest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1688.1s	1688.1	 in more housing in California. And I think that this Atherton
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1692.4s	1692.4	 example is sort of cherry picked, because what this is, is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1694.6s	1694.6	 really zoning. You know, there are these suburbs, and it's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1699.0s	1699.0	 just Atherton, I mean, you got the East Bay as well, where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1701.6s	1701.6	 people live in these areas that are zoned for single family
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1704.8s	1704.8	 residences, as opposed to multifamily. And that determines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1708.6s	1708.6	 the character of the neighborhood. Now, if you go buy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1711.4s	1711.4	 a house in one of those neighborhoods, with that zoning,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1714.6s	1714.6	 then that's what you expect to be the case. I mean, you have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1717.7s	1717.7	 spend more money buying a house in that neighborhood, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1719.8s	1719.8	 you are investing in the character of that neighborhood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1723.0s	1723.0	 So, it is unfair to the residents of that neighborhood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1726.2s	1726.2	 for a developer to come along and say, hey, I'm going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1729.0s	1729.0	 change the character of this place, so I can make money, I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1732.0s	1732.0	 going to take a bunch of single family lots, turn them into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1734.9s	1734.9	 multifamily apartment complexes, or something like that. So, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1738.4s	1738.4	 can understand why the residents would be against that. So, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1741.8s	1741.8	 would differentiate between legitimate reasons for zoning,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1745.0s	1745.0	 and then things that the state or cities have done to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1750.2s	1750.2	 undermine the market for housing, basically creating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1753.3s	1753.3	 frictions or impediments in the market for housing. Now, it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1756.0s	1756.0	 the case that as cities get bigger and need to free up land
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1759.1s	1759.1	 that you might need to rezone. But the areas that you should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1762.2s	1762.2	 look out for that should make sense, right? I mean, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1765.1s	1765.1	 think you go off to Atherton and change the character of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1769.0s	1769.0	 neighborhood so that you can buy five more units.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1771.0s	1771.0	 Yeah, I mean, you should look at like, why not look at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1774.2s	1774.2	 areas around say, public transit, like the barts and so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1778.3s	1778.3	 forth, where you could basically go up around there, and it would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1781.8s	1781.8	 make sense for the neighborhood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1783.6s	1783.6	 I mean, the example I would give to kind of paint an extreme
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1787.4s	1787.4	 picture is let's say you want to farm in the countryside, someone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1791.2s	1791.2	 buys the farm next to you and then decides they want to build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1794.2s	1794.2	 a 50 story tall skyscraper next to your farm, you would have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1798.4s	1798.4	 serious objection because I think that the I mean, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1801.4s	1801.4	 look at the town of Venice in Italy. I mean, Shamoff, you've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1804.2s	1804.2	 been there recently, but, you know, communities, local
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1807.6s	1807.6	 communities can define the character of their community by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1810.6s	1810.6	 making zoning laws that, you know, allow a small city to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1815.5s	1815.5	 remain like a small city. I've also always been against this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1818.9s	1818.9	 notion that we should allow any developer to build any size
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1822.1s	1822.1	 building anywhere they want in San Francisco, which has been an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1825.0s	1825.0	 ardent cry from Silicon Valley progressives for years that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1829.3s	1829.3	 need to let them build, let them build. But at the end of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1831.4s	1831.4	 day, I moved to San Francisco 22 years ago, and it was a small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1834.8s	1834.8	 quaint city, it felt like a small city. And building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1837.5s	1837.5	 skyscrapers made it more congested, made it less
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1840.2s	1840.2	 inviting, made it feel more industrial, and it wasn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1842.8s	1842.8	 appealing to me as a resident. And I think that residents need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1846.3s	1846.3	 to have the right to define what they want their community to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1849.2s	1849.2	 The question it brings up then is, where do you build? Because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1852.4s	1852.4	 all residents everywhere would want to block family housing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1854.6s	1854.6	 multifamily housing, skyscrapers. So I mean, Shamoff, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1857.4s	1857.4	 don't know if you have a point of view to counter what we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1859.9s	1859.9	 saying, but you know, how do we think about solving this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1862.3s	1862.3	 problem at scale, if everyone wants their local communities to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1866.3s	1866.3	 remain quaint, and interesting and not be built out?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1869.2s	1869.2	 Well, I think I think that's true for people who can afford
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1872.4s	1872.4	 really nice homes in the suburbs. Right. But there are a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1875.6s	1875.6	 lot of people that live in highly dense housing in urban
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1879.3s	1879.3	 environments. And I think that's where we need to focus first. If
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1882.9s	1882.9	 you look at the data, California needs to build three and a half
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1887.0s	1887.0	 million extra homes by 2025. That's a rule, right? That's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1890.8s	1890.8	 a so David's right, like focusing on a town with a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1893.2s	1893.2	 population of 7,000 people is not going to solve the three and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1896.6s	1896.6	 a half million homes we need to build. And it brings up a bigger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1900.4s	1900.4	 question, which is then who is going to pay for all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1902.4s	1902.4	 physical infrastructure that's going to be required, let's just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1905.0s	1905.0	 say you're able to actually double the population of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1907.0s	1907.0	 Atherton to 14,000. Well, you know, I live near that area. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1911.5s	1911.5	 what I'll tell you is Atherton has bad flooding. Dave, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1917.2s	1917.2	 sacks actually used to live near there too. So sacks can can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1919.8s	1919.8	 confirm this. You know, depending on when it rains, huge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1923.5s	1923.5	 pockets of water just collect everywhere, that infrastructure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1926.4s	1926.4	 is bad. There are no sidewalks, right? So you kind of walk just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1930.8s	1930.8	 on the road. So cars whipping by, you know, could pick you off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1936.1s	1936.1	 at any moment. Now, those are decisions that, as David said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1939.5s	1939.5	 the residents of that town made decades ago, because of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1943.9s	1943.9	 lifestyle that it created, and they traded away a highly dense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1949.1s	1949.1	 urban environment. Whereas if you just moved a mile, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1953.0s	1953.0	 south, there are parts of Menlo Park and parts of Palo Alto,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1957.6s	1957.6	 that are already in a situation to absorb very dense housing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1962.5s	1962.5	 where you could put that extra seven or 8000 people pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1965.8s	1965.8	 easily. What do you what do you do when those people in that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1968.6s	1968.6	 neighborhood in Menlo Park say I don't want another apartment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1971.0s	1971.0	 building here, I want it to be down the road in Atherton,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1973.4s	1973.4	 right? How do you resolve this conflict? And I just want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1976.4s	1976.4	 remind everyone in September, Cal, I signed these bills,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1980.3s	1980.3	 right? He signed 31 affordable housing bills, which mandate by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1984.2s	1984.2	 zip code and by city and by town, the building of affordable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1987.2s	1987.2	 housing to create equity in this problem. Or which basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1991.2s	1991.2	 means all these cities and all these towns are now scrambling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1993.8s	1993.8	 to figure out how do we meet our state mandated objectives of new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=1998.1s	1998.1	 affordable housing in our zip code, or in our town. And by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2001.0s	2001.0	 way, look, I mean, look, the and I think exactly, as you said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2005.4s	2005.4	 what will happen now is it goes to some state commission. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2008.9s	2008.9	 think that state commission can issue some sort of penalty or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2011.5s	2011.5	 something. So, you know, it's, it's, I think the residents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2014.8s	2014.8	 will pay for that freedom, if you will, to not have that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2019.0s	2019.0	 building happen. But again, I just go back to it doesn't solve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2023.2s	2023.2	 the crux of the problem. The crux of the problem is we need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2026.8s	2026.8	 solve this housing crisis in the order of magnitude of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2030.8s	2030.8	 millions of homes. Okay. And so millions of homes can only be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2036.2s	2036.2	 absorbed mostly in cities. So the real conversation and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2040.8s	2040.8	 know, is I have more sympathy for the residents of Atherton
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2044.9s	2044.9	 than I do for residents of the city of San Francisco. Okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2048.8s	2048.8	 because there is dense housing in San Francisco, there already
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2052.7s	2052.7	 is an infrastructure, social services that were designed and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2057.0s	2057.0	 built there are sidewalks. Again, simple example, there are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2060.8s	2060.8	 stoplights, you know, in San Francisco, that a lot of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2064.4s	2064.4	 towns don't actually have now again, that was a decision they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2067.5s	2067.5	 made 50 years ago, and they would have to change that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2069.8s	2069.8	 decision. But my point is, like, there are there are places that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2072.9s	2072.9	 are already shovel ready. And the real question is, why can't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2076.4s	2076.4	 we build hundreds of 1000s of units? And so this is a good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2080.5s	2080.5	 article to write, because it's a Tony neighborhood. And you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2083.4s	2083.4	 know, there's a few 1000 folks. But I think the real issue won't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2087.3s	2087.3	 get solved until we figure out how to greenlight hundreds of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2090.4s	2090.4	 1000s and millions because we are three and a half million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2092.9s	2092.9	 homes short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2093.5s	2093.5	 Jay, Cal, what do you think? I mean, are you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2095.2s	2095.2	 Well, you know, the the truth here is that this is not about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2099.2s	2099.2	 Atherton. This is every town, every city in California is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2102.4s	2102.4	 fighting all development. Because if you fight the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2104.4s	2104.4	 development, well, yeah, you would obviously have less
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2107.2s	2107.2	 traffic and supply and demand your homes become more valuable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2110.4s	2110.4	 The place that's fought it most of all is San Francisco in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2112.6s	2112.6	 city, where you cannot convert homes, you cannot take your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2116.5s	2116.5	 Victorian and make it into a townhome. And then if you look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2119.5s	2119.5	 at what's actually happening here, what they're fighting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2121.5s	2121.5	 against, and you know, this is the hypocrisy of it is, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2124.1s	2124.1	 know, these are townhomes, this isn't like a 20 story, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2128.5s	2128.5	 giant apartment building, they're townhomes, and they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2131.7s	2131.7	 going to be $3 million each, and they're not going to be for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2134.5s	2134.5	 scary people and criminals and ruining people's quality of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2137.8s	2137.8	 life. It's going to be the venture partner or the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2141.0s	2141.0	 receptionist, or not even the receptionist, it'd be a venture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2144.0s	2144.0	 partner, it's going to be a CTO at a tech company who's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2146.0s	2146.0	 to be able to buy this, and then be that much closer to work. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2149.3s	2149.3	 so it does wreak of hypocrisy. And there's a really simple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2152.6s	2152.6	 solution here, which is, you know, there are Caltrain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2156.1s	2156.1	 stations up and down the peninsula, there are, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2159.2s	2159.2	 in some places, you have other municipal transportation along
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2164.5s	2164.5	 those corridors, they should build up and they should build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2167.3s	2167.3	 10 story apartments, etc. Redwood City did this recently,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2170.5s	2170.5	 we've all been there and seen the apartments are the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2172.1s	2172.1	 courageous, they're 60.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2173.3s	2173.3	 Cal, you're talking about you're talking about the exact kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2176.1s	2176.1	 solution we need, because instead of trying to solve 100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2179.1s	2179.1	 units here or there, Redwood City did an incredible job, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2181.8s	2181.8	 solved it in the scale of 10s of 1000s of units. And it completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2185.8s	2185.8	 changed the downtown of Redwood City, it is awesome. And it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2188.3s	2188.3	 awesome. Incredible. So what is it afraid of? So what is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2192.4s	2192.4	 incredible? This is NIMBY is a matter of course, in my mind,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2195.3s	2195.3	 I'm not going to specifically make it about Marc and Tristan, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2197.4s	2197.4	 think everybody, you know, has the right to live in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2199.8s	2199.8	 neighborhood they want, they get to state their feelings. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2202.4s	2202.4	 what we need to do is convince people. And I think there's two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2205.0s	2205.0	 really good arguments here. Number one, do you want your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2207.9s	2207.9	 chef, your kids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2209.1s	2209.1	 convince people to let their neighborhoods change?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2211.2s	2211.2	 To let them evolve modestly to have homes that their own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2216.4s	2216.4	 children or their own chefs and housekeepers and associates, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2220.3s	2220.3	 all know people in the in the area who have bought apartment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2223.0s	2223.0	 buildings for their nannies, because you couldn't get a nanny
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2226.2s	2226.2	 or you couldn't get a chef. So you you bought some unit in Redwood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2228.8s	2228.8	 City, and you rented it for your nannies or whatever. Like we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2231.4s	2231.4	 don't know people that have not everyone. I know multiple who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2235.4s	2235.4	 have considered it. And so that's the way you would convince
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2238.1s	2238.1	 NIMBY people to evolve here. And then there's a second one. This
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2241.9s	2241.9	 has to do with work from home. When you commute, you know, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2246.2s	2246.2	 issues of domestic violence, depression, drug abuse, substance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2250.1s	2250.1	 abuse, alcohol abuse, all of that goes way up. And it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2253.4s	2253.4	 somewhere between 30 and 40 minutes of a commute, you start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2256.4s	2256.4	 to see people's quality of life seriously deteriorates. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2259.6s	2259.6	 if we want people to come back to offices, which Apple just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2263.1s	2263.1	 mandated last week, everybody's coming back three days a week,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2265.9s	2265.9	 like it or not, Tuesday, Thursday, then you pick the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2269.1s	2269.1	 Wednesday, you want to come to work, I guess. If we want people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2273.3s	2273.3	 to come back to work, well, yeah, we're gonna have to build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2274.9s	2274.9	 some taller homes, the CEOs, the founders of the companies, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2279.1s	2279.1	 venture firms, it's not about Mark Andreessen, it's about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2281.2s	2281.2	 everybody. They don't have to commute, the office is within
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2285.0s	2285.0	 walking distance or a bike ride of their office, people need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2288.4s	2288.4	 start thinking about their nanny, their chef, their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2290.5s	2290.5	 firefighter and their employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2292.0s	2292.0	 Jason, I may have misread it, but it wouldn't have solved the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2294.9s	2294.9	 problem for the nanny, the chef, the teacher, the fire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2297.2s	2297.2	 No, this would be $3 million units.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2298.9s	2298.9	 No, they wouldn't even be that because the way that it read
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2301.4s	2301.4	 because I read it said that it you would have qualified it by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2304.4s	2304.4	 building what's called an ADU on your property. Yes. So that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2308.3s	2308.3	 another solution. So people would have built it for their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2311.1s	2311.1	 grandmother or their in law. So people are doing that. My point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2314.7s	2314.7	 is, the law the law as proposed was already hacks. And so it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2319.0s	2319.0	 was never have accomplished what you were saying. I think the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2321.5s	2321.5	 answer to what you're saying is what Redwood City did. It's what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2324.3s	2324.3	 towns all around the country should be doing, which is like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2327.6s	2327.6	 in and around, particularly like transportation hubs, you should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2330.9s	2330.9	 be green lighting a lot of dense housing. But Jason, those are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2334.0s	2334.0	 not ADUs that sit on a property. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2336.8s	2336.8	 those are those are 500. And by the way, those also required not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2341.0s	2341.0	 just the infrastructure, but it also requires the financing and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2343.9s	2343.9	 all the, you know, the banks and construction market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2346.6s	2346.6	 It's there to construct it. That's not a problem in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2348.3s	2348.3	 California. The opposition is the problem, which is why the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2350.9s	2350.9	 federal, I'm sorry, the state government's getting involved,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2353.6s	2353.6	 and superseding or trying to supersede what happens on a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2355.8s	2355.8	 local level. That's why Gavin Newsom is passing these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2358.6s	2358.6	 is because each town is refusing to do it. But another possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2361.4s	2361.4	 solution is if Atherton is so good at blocking this stuff, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2363.8s	2363.8	 they have so much money, let them pay a penalty and have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2368.0s	2368.0	 Redwood City or San Carlos, or another neighborhood Millbrae
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2372.0s	2372.0	 that wants money. And they want to build up Millbrae is building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2375.5s	2375.5	 because that's where the BART station ends is in Millbrae.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2377.6s	2377.6	 Just to keep us on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2378.2s	2378.2	 They're building up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2379.1s	2379.1	 Well, you're describing like are all these contortions and what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2382.4s	2382.4	 should be a more free market for housing construction. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2386.2s	2386.2	 the reality is we've done so many things to distort the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2389.2s	2389.2	 market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2389.9s	2389.9	 Agreed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2390.3s	2390.3	 With these labyrinthine permit process processes that delay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2393.8s	2393.8	 projects for years and years to, you know, to all the taxes and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2398.9s	2398.9	 other rules. Yeah, well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2401.6s	2401.6	 they fight it. They fight with all these environmental stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2404.2s	2404.2	 Zoning is a little different yet. So the NIMBYism factors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2407.0s	2407.0	 into the permitting process. But, but I would again, I would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2410.4s	2410.4	 differentiate zoning. But my point is just we've like so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2414.0s	2414.0	 broken the free market for housing, that we then come along
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2417.8s	2417.8	 and say, see the free market's not working. We need more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2420.4s	2420.4	 government mandates. Look, is this happening in Miami? No, go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2424.2s	2424.2	 to Miami. There are cranes everywhere. They're building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2426.5s	2426.5	 Houston. They're building multifamily or exactly. So in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2430.0s	2430.0	 these, frankly, red cities, red states, which are much more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2433.4s	2433.4	 lightly regulated, they're building a lot more. But at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2436.8s	2436.8	 same time, it's not like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2438.2s	2438.2	 in New York, which is constrained. So you have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2440.4s	2440.4	 build up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2441.0s	2441.0	 Yeah. But Houston has no zoning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2443.5s	2443.5	 Yeah, New York City has always had a very non sentimental view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2449.0s	2449.0	 towards construction. The city has always said, Okay, if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2452.6s	2452.6	 want to build something bigger and better, you can tear it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2454.9s	2454.9	 down and start over. I mean, they have like air rights and so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2457.7s	2457.7	 on that you have to respect. But but New York City has never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2461.0s	2461.0	 they by and large, they don't constantly label buildings as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2465.2s	2465.2	 historic and say you can't touch them and things like that. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2467.6s	2467.6	 New York City has always wanted to keep being dynamic and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2470.6s	2470.6	 growing. So there are other places that just don't have this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2474.0s	2474.0	 problem. And they're able to achieve this growth without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2477.7s	2477.7	 building an apartment complex like in the lot next to you, if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2480.9s	2480.9	 you live in the suburbs, and have a single family residence. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2484.0s	2484.0	 mean, so I just think like, you know, the the politicians in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2488.7s	2488.7	 California have so thoroughly broken the market for housing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2491.6s	2491.6	 And now, what happens is, you get an article like this, that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2496.0s	2496.0	 basically scapegoating the residents of a suburb as being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2500.6s	2500.6	 the source of the problem when they didn't create this problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2503.1s	2503.1	 They're just fighting to keep the status quo. So they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2505.2s	2505.2	 perpetuating it, I would say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2506.2s	2506.2	 But you know, like, so first of all, I have no special love for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2508.2s	2508.2	 Atherton, Toronto. I lived there for a couple years, and it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2510.7s	2510.7	 kind of like a Stepford community. I mean, I had to move
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2513.9s	2513.9	 back to the city. Well, I'm like, you know, somehow I'm just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2517.7s	2517.7	 more comfortable stepping over dirty needles and excrement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2521.7s	2521.7	 You're voting with your dollar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2523.7s	2523.7	 I moved back to San Francisco, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2525.4s	2525.4	 masochist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2526.7s	2526.7	 But look, Atherton is like a really weird place because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2531.2s	2531.2	 Al Pacino and the devil's advocate. Go ahead,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2533.7s	2533.7	 Suggs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2534.0s	2534.0	 In addition to there being no sidewalks, there's literally no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2536.9s	2536.9	 offices, there's no grocery store, there's no commercial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2540.2s	2540.2	 real estate of any kind. There is no downtown there is there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2544.0s	2544.0	 you know, so I don't know, like where the hook is that you would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2547.4s	2547.4	 all of a sudden put an apartment complex. I mean, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2549.6s	2549.6	 literally going to be building it in someone's backyard. So the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2553.0s	2553.0	 character of that neighborhood just doesn't support it. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2555.0s	2555.0	 think, you know, people coming together to form their own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2558.1s	2558.1	 cities, you know, under the principle of subsidiarity should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2561.2s	2561.2	 be allowed reasonable freedom to basically construct a city as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2565.2s	2565.2	 they want in the way that they want to live.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2567.4s	2567.4	 And there are other cities that competition Friedberg, there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2569.9s	2569.9	 other cities that competition Houston has no zoning,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2572.4s	2572.4	 essentially. So you can if you have a lot and you want to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2575.2s	2575.2	 it into a school or a hotel or a restaurant, you can do it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2579.4s	2579.4	 then outside of Austin, you kind of have that same thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2581.7s	2581.7	 People build all kinds of weird compounds and stuff out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2584.0s	2584.0	 Are you guys following? So it's a competition between those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2586.2s	2586.2	 cities. And I think San Francisco is losing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2588.2s	2588.2	 Yeah, are you guys following any of the startup cities that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2590.8s	2590.8	 being built where there's like a new city being built from the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2593.2s	2593.2	 ground up and any of those seem like cul-de-sac? I mean, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2597.0s	2597.0	 know the names of any of them, but cul-de-sac is one. Yeah. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2599.8s	2599.8	 mean, are these real? Are these real projects? Are we going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2601.7s	2601.7	 see these emerging like next gen cities that, you know, could be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2605.9s	2605.9	 viable places to move to and live? Or is it really just about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2608.9s	2608.9	 you know, transforming some of these cities that are less
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2610.8s	2610.8	 regulatory, and that's ultimately what will win in the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2613.1s	2613.1	 You know, part of why the the regulation has gotten so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2615.6s	2615.6	 perverted in a lot of these towns is because you've been able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2618.4s	2618.4	 to gerrymander how you know, these public school districts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2621.5s	2621.5	 get funded. And so you know, why folks are so protective of it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2626.1s	2626.1	 is again, and you know, to, to underscore one of Sax's points,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2630.8s	2630.8	 this is much more prevalent in democratic states and democratic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2634.7s	2634.7	 cities where, you know, coastal elites have really gerrymandered
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2640.0s	2640.0	 these school districts. And that's a large reason why they,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2644.5s	2644.5	 they don't want a lot of building, they want to protect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2647.2s	2647.2	 the tax base, and they want to be able to funnel those specific
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2650.1s	2650.1	 tax dollars into a few schools for their kids. And that's it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2654.4s	2654.4	 Yeah. And so it's, it's actually a really good point, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2657.2s	2657.2	 bought people don't know this undercurrent, which is, oh, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2660.0s	2660.0	 is on the peninsula. By the way, this is the dirtiest little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2662.6s	2662.6	 secret in these democratic states. Again, mostly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2666.8s	2666.8	 democratic. But if you look inside of California, and a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2670.1s	2670.1	 couple of other states, how horrendously gerrymandered it is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2674.4s	2674.4	 so that you can basically redistrict in a way to cordon off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2678.3s	2678.3	 tax dollars to only then sent to one or two public schools that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2681.9s	2681.9	 sit inside of your area, your zip code, because that's what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2685.0s	2685.0	 law says it's a zip code oriented scheme is perverse, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2688.8s	2688.8	 created incredibly horrible incentives for people. So now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2692.8s	2692.8	 David is right, which is that there's a there's a contortion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2695.4s	2695.4	 of laws that come together, that underlie some of these decisions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2699.2s	2699.2	 that then manifest in a petition like this, and etc. They all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2703.0s	2703.0	 need to get cleaned up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2704.7s	2704.7	 And Chamath, it's it's it's even worse than that, because the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2707.2s	2707.2	 same people who have rigged it so that all their tax dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2710.4s	2710.4	 stay in their non development community, then they're over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2714.0s	2714.0	 funding their public schools, they could have easily afford
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2716.2s	2716.2	 private, but they're using all that money for just their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2718.7s	2718.7	 private school. And the one in the town next to it, East
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2721.0s	2721.0	 Palo Alto, whatever, they have no money. And then these people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2725.0s	2725.0	 have the audacity to fight against school choice, so that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2727.8s	2727.8	 those poor people can take tax dollars and then pick a better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2731.2s	2731.2	 school. So it's hypocrisy all the way up and down. And you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2734.5s	2734.5	 know, I think this is why people are largely moving to different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2737.5s	2737.5	 places around the country. And it's a competition between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2740.0s	2740.0	 states and cities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2740.6s	2740.6	 Okay, we're going to go from super local to global. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2744.5s	2744.5	 this is a topic I wanted to talk about today, because I want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2748.0s	2748.0	 bring together a couple of of breads and get your guys's take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2753.0s	2753.0	 on, you know, all of these things kind of coming together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2755.5s	2755.5	 and what it means for foreign policy, and how things might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2760.1s	2760.1	 play out on the global stage in the next, you know, call it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2763.4s	2763.4	 years to decades. Xi Jinping, it's been reported this week, is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2768.4s	2768.4	 taking a trip to Saudi Arabia. You know, this is just a few
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2773.0s	2773.0	 weeks after Joe Biden made his trip to Saudi Arabia. I'll read
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2777.5s	2777.5	 just an excerpt. He's going to end his more than two years of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2780.5s	2780.5	 self imposed in person diplomatic isolation. And his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2784.0s	2784.0	 first trip is going to be to Saudi Arabia. You know, this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2788.2s	2788.2	 from unnamed Saudi sources. So it's unclear. This isn't an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2791.1s	2791.1	 official statement. This is just reporting. You know, the Wall
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2796.0s	2796.0	 Street Journal reported in March that after six years of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2798.7s	2798.7	 negotiations, China and Saudi Arabia are getting close for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2803.4s	2803.4	 China to start paying yuan for oil that they would be buying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2809.2s	2809.2	 from the Saudis. So there's an important kind of economic tie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2812.5s	2812.5	 up that may be emerging that that could affect the US dollar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2815.7s	2815.7	 and the importance of the US dollar on the global economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2819.0s	2819.0	 stage. And meanwhile, this week as well, it's been reported that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2823.5s	2823.5	 China is doing military exercises with Russia inside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2827.4s	2827.4	 Russia. So there is an extension of China and their influence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2832.2s	2832.2	 and their economic tie ups and their military activity with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2835.8s	2835.8	 both China. Sorry with both Russia and Saudi. I also want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2839.9s	2839.9	 highlight another important point that came out this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2842.5s	2842.5	 Saudi Aramco reported their earnings, the largest earnings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2846.0s	2846.0	 ever for a company $48 billion of net profit in a quarter. That
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2852.0s	2852.0	 is more profit than Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Tesla
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2855.7s	2855.7	 combined in a single quarter. It is the most profitable business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2860.4s	2860.4	 And Saudis have been very public about their intention of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2864.0s	2864.0	 divesting their interest in Saudi Aramco, which is their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2867.2s	2867.2	 state owned and state run oil company, and moving into other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2870.5s	2870.5	 businesses. Over the past couple of months, it's been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2873.7s	2873.7	 reported that they've accumulated a nearly $100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2876.1s	2876.1	 billion equity portfolio, owning stocks like Alphabet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2880.1s	2880.1	 Zoom, Microsoft and others. It's also been reported that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2883.5s	2883.5	 own over $160 billion of US treasuries. So the US is very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2889.1s	2889.1	 dependent in the private equity community in the VC community
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2891.8s	2891.8	 and in the public markets on Saudi dollars. Saudis have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2895.1s	2895.1	 large holders of US dollars. And now through China, it looks like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2898.6s	2898.6	 the Saudis may be having a tie up that brings them closer to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2901.5s	2901.5	 China through this trade relationship with the yuan and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2904.5s	2904.5	 the visit from Xi Jinping, while China is actively exercising,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2909.5s	2909.5	 you know, their military inside of Russia. Is the future a China,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2914.7s	2914.7	 Russia, Saudi axis? And should we be concerned? And should we be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2918.8s	2918.8	 changing any of our tactics on foreign policy, David Sachs, as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2922.8s	2922.8	 this, you know, set of threads plays out over the next couple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2927.0s	2927.0	 of months and you know, going? Yes, I think we do need to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2929.7s	2929.7	 some changes. Bines backing away from this now. But in his first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2932.9s	2932.9	 year, he declared the Saudis to be pariahs and he did push them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2936.8s	2936.8	 into China's arms. What was the point of that? Biden recently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2941.5s	2941.5	 had to go to the Middle East to basically beg Saudi Arabia to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2944.3s	2944.3	 increase their production of oil. So he's already acknowledged
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2947.6s	2947.6	 the policy didn't work. And one of the reasons it didn't work is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2950.3s	2950.3	 because simultaneously with declaring these allies to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2953.6s	2953.6	 enemies, he basically restricted US to energy production, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2957.9s	2957.9	 is, you know, strategically undermined. So the US has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2961.2s	2961.2	 military bases in Saudi Arabia. Very strategic assets for the US
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2965.5s	2965.5	 military. Yeah, listen, listen, we sell them weapons, the US
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2968.4s	2968.4	 relationship with Saudi Arabia is always can be complex. They're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2972.4s	2972.4	 a complicated friend to have. But it's much better to have them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2975.2s	2975.2	 as a friend than basically drive them into China's arms. And the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2978.2s	2978.2	 reality is, whatever you think about the regime there and how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2981.8s	2981.8	 oppressive it is, first of all, we don't get to choose the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2984.8s	2984.8	 people running these countries. That's the lesson we should have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2987.2s	2987.2	 learned over and over again from all these failed regime change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2989.8s	2989.8	 operations. Second, do we have any reason to believe that if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2993.4s	2993.4	 that regime got toppled, it would get replaced with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2995.7s	2995.7	 something better? I think we all know that if the regime there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=2999.3s	2999.3	 fell, it would probably be replaced with something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3001.8s	3001.8	 fundamentalist that we would like even less. And certainly if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3006.0s	3006.0	 another nation were to basically dominate the region, like Iran,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3009.8s	3009.8	 that would be worse for us as well. So our relationship with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3012.4s	3012.4	 them is complicated, but ultimately, they should be, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3014.7s	3014.7	 think, allies of the United States, and we should not be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3016.8s	3016.8	 working overtime to push them into China's arms. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3020.6s	3020.6	 similarly with Russia, we've basically declared ourselves to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3024.5s	3024.5	 be engaged in this proxy war with Russia, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3028.8s	3028.8	 strategically, there's just nothing in it for us. You can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3032.1s	3032.1	 sympathize with the people of Ukraine all you want, but it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3034.8s	3034.8	 dangerous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3035.7s	3035.7	 You've said that in the past. And I think the question is, does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3037.8s	3037.8	 this China military exercise in Russia indicate an escalation of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3042.8s	3042.8	 our conflict with China to you? Or is this something that is just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3048.7s	3048.7	 kind of par for the course in terms of neighbors conducting?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3053.5s	3053.5	 Meir Scheimer just sent an article in Foreign Affairs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3055.6s	3055.6	 talking about the Ukraine war reminding us that it's still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3058.6s	3058.6	 going on. I think people somehow think that this war is just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3062.0s	3062.0	 stable, and it'll settle into forever war status kind of like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3066.0s	3066.0	 Afghanistan, these conflicts in the Middle East, and it's went
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3068.1s	3068.1	 on forever. It's actually very dangerous. It can always escalate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3071.6s	3071.6	 out of control. And as long as it's going on, I think we just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3075.0s	3075.0	 have to remember that it's going on, it poses a huge global risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3077.9s	3077.9	 And I would say that one of the things that, again, we should be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3081.6s	3081.6	 aware of is this idea that even though we have problems and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3086.5s	3086.5	 conflicts with multiple nations, we still don't actually want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3089.6s	3089.6	 push them into each other's arms. Again, the Soviet Union and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3092.9s	3092.9	 China during the Cold War being the key example. I mean, this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3095.8s	3095.8	 principle of geopolitics goes back thousands of years, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3099.0s	3099.0	 Romans, right? Divide et Impera, divide and rule. You do not want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3102.8s	3102.8	 to unite your enemies. And what we've done here is we keep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3106.2s	3106.2	 pushing them together. You know, China and Russia, historically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3110.5s	3110.5	 have not been friends. They share long borders together,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3113.7s	3113.7	 neighbors generally have problems with each other. These
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3116.7s	3116.7	 are nations with serious conflicts or differences of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3119.6s	3119.6	 interests. And we've made it really easy for China to turn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3124.6s	3124.6	 Russia into the junior partner in that relationship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3127.9s	3127.9	 Chamath, do you think US foreign policy needs to change and that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3130.9s	3130.9	 we're setting up this, you know, access of conflict, this access
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3136.2s	3136.2	 of allies that we don't want to have the allies and you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3139.9s	3139.9	 would you kind of advise and also, you know, do you get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3143.8s	3143.8	 concerned about this oil yuan trade where there may be some,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3149.2s	3149.2	 you know, economic tie ups that that really could affect, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3153.2s	3153.2	 know, the dollar as a reserve currency?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3155.1s	3155.1	 Look, a couple things I think it's really dramatic to kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3159.3s	3159.3	 paint it in these stark kind of like bipolar terms. I think we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3163.2s	3163.2	 are post all of that. So I understand how in the Cold War,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3167.8s	3167.8	 it was easy to fall into binary definitions of good and evil,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3170.8s	3170.8	 one and zero us versus them, team A versus team B. But in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3175.5s	3175.5	 2022, I don't think that's how things work anymore. We're in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3179.0s	3179.0	 highly interconnected, highly global world. It's very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3182.2s	3182.2	 complicated. dollar flows are real time, they're massive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3187.3s	3187.3	 cooperation is real time. It's all over the world. It's with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3190.9s	3190.9	 every country. So it allows every country actually the first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3193.7s	3193.7	 chance that they've ever really had to maximize their own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3197.1s	3197.1	 potential for their own citizens. And that's really what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3199.5s	3199.5	 every country's goal is. Right. And so in that lens, look what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3204.3s	3204.3	 just happened today. gasprom said they're going to shut off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3207.3s	3207.3	 Nord Stream one just for a few, you know, a few days, right. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3210.6s	3210.6	 as a result of that, EU net gas has just gone absolutely nuclear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3214.4s	3214.4	 and just closed at all time high 14x 14x where it was pandemic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3219.0s	3219.0	 right? You know, price per unit for a year ahead. So if you so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3223.4s	3223.4	 take a step back, we are at max energy production with all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3228.2s	3228.2	 the capacity all around the world 100 plus odd million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3231.5s	3231.5	 barrels a day. Okay, global productivity absorbs that there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3236.9s	3236.9	 is very little room right now to expand that without pushing the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3241.4s	3241.4	 date in which that capacity is available out until you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3245.0s	3245.0	 2028 to 2030. So effectively a decade from now. So if you're in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3250.6s	3250.6	 a situation in your country with vast natural resources, of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3254.7s	3254.7	 which I'll just remind us America is one. I think the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3258.9s	3258.9	 important thing you can do for your own citizens is to monetize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3262.4s	3262.4	 these petrochemicals now. Get it out of the ground in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3266.1s	3266.1	 reasonable way. Sell them in the marketplace because there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3269.6s	3269.6	 demand for it. Take that money and reinvest it in your people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3274.3s	3274.3	 And I think if you look at it that way, the best run countries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3278.8s	3278.8	 are responding to this moment in time like any company would. How
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3282.7s	3282.7	 do you maximize demand and sell the product you have to the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3285.6s	3285.6	 number of customers globally. And so I think the Middle East is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3288.9s	3288.9	 doing an incredible job. The US by the way, by passing the IRA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3293.7s	3293.7	 Finally, I think is on the right footing because we can talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3297.5s	3297.5	 this in a moment. But the path to permitting and the path to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3300.4s	3300.4	 clean up and by the way, it puts fossil fuels on a level playing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3304.0s	3304.0	 field with with clean energy alternatives, emerging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3308.2s	3308.2	 alternatives. Yeah, the best thing that could have happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3311.0s	3311.0	 Okay, so I think we're all behaving in a very rational
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3316.0s	3316.0	 market focused way. And so I would focus less on trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3321.5s	3321.5	 dramatically kind of resolve these things as a few countries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3324.4s	3324.4	 versus everybody else. I don't think that's what's happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3327.0s	3327.0	 Yeah, now much more complex, much more complicated than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3329.7s	3329.7	 But I think the simple explanation is people with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3333.0s	3333.0	 resources in the ground of the country in which they rule have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3337.2s	3337.2	 a responsibility. If they believe that there's market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3340.1s	3340.1	 demand to absorb that so that they can take the revenue that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3343.1s	3343.1	 comes from it and reinvest it in their people. That is true for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3346.3s	3346.3	 the United States. It's true for Saudi Arabia. It's true for every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3348.8s	3348.8	 country in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3349.8s	3349.8	 Yeah, Saudi Arabia is clearly making these investments, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3352.5s	3352.5	 Not just on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3353.5s	3353.5	 Yeah, by the way, I mean, like, but also housing and new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3356.2s	3356.2	 industry and education. And then by the way, Saudi Arabia is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3361.2s	3361.2	 becoming much more liberal as a result to write education
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3363.9s	3363.9	 standards. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3364.6s	3364.6	 And if you look at the investment, like, you know, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3367.4s	3367.4	 didn't, you didn't need to go to Dave Swenson and understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3371.4s	3371.4	 portfolio allocation, although I think the guys in Saudi are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3373.8s	3373.8	 smart enough to have probably done it. But if you're if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3378.6s	3378.6	 have a lot of money coming from one kind of business, and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3383.0s	3383.0	 need to make sure that you can diversify so that you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3385.2s	3385.2	 reinvest over a long period of time. If you look at countries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3388.4s	3388.4	 that had huge petrochemical related revenue flows, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3391.5s	3391.5	 Nordics, what did they do? They stood up these huge sovereign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3394.4s	3394.4	 wealth funds. And those sovereign wealth funds went
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3397.0s	3397.0	 abroad, and they bought all kinds of non correlated assets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3400.2s	3400.2	 to those petrochemicals. That is the same thing that Saudi is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3403.9s	3403.9	 doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3405.0s	3405.0	 Financial security for their people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3406.7s	3406.7	 But it's like it's like what is the furthest uncorrelated asset
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3409.8s	3409.8	 from oil, it turns out it's Apple, Facebook, Meta and Google.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3413.1s	3413.1	 And US US treasuries. Yeah. Yeah. Uber. Hey, so Jake, let me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3417.6s	3417.6	 let me ask this contrarian question for you. Because you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3420.9s	3420.9	 often talk about the authoritarianism of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3423.9s	3423.9	 states, Saudi, China, Russia. You know, it seems to me, as we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3428.4s	3428.4	 observe what's going on in Saudi, and maybe the case could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3432.1s	3432.1	 be made in China to some degree, although there are steps taken
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3435.3s	3435.3	 back, but also in Russia, that the US influence, the economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3441.0s	3441.0	 and the political influence associated with these these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3443.3s	3443.3	 foreign policy conversions, could they maybe be driving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3448.4s	3448.4	 these business, these countries to be more liberal? You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3451.4s	3451.4	 we're seeing in Saudi now that women can drive that there's new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3455.1s	3455.1	 industry, that there's education, that there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3456.6s	3456.6	 technology industry booming, that the you don't need to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3460.8s	3460.8	 a turnover of government and a turnover of what is often
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3464.6s	3464.6	 classified as authoritarian regime for the operating model
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3468.2s	3468.2	 to be influenced by the West in such a way that change happens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3471.9s	3471.9	 more slowly. And you do see liberalism emerge in these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3475.4s	3475.4	 countries with better educational standards, more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3477.9s	3477.9	 equality, more more human rights. And so do you think we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3481.8s	3481.8	 kind of because you often kind of paint a picture that it's bad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3484.9s	3484.9	 guys versus us, you know, do you not think that we're making an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3488.0s	3488.0	 influence on these places locally and that we're seeing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3490.1s	3490.1	 Well, I would take exception to like, it's bad guys versus us. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3493.7s	3493.7	 don't I don't think we want to create a legion of dictators.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3495.8s	3495.8	 And nor do I think that's what this is, I would actually agree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3498.1s	3498.1	 with Sachs, we should be embracing these folks, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3501.3s	3501.3	 having strong relationships with them, even though we are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3504.6s	3504.6	 fundamentally different operating systems for our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3507.0s	3507.0	 countries, democracy, we should be embracing. So you think we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3510.6s	3510.6	 should have a relationship with Putin?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3511.8s	3511.8	 Just a hundred percent. I mean, and we did, right? I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3514.8s	3514.8	 Obama was making some progress on that. And we we did some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3518.1s	3518.1	 great work. When, and obviously, Trump has a very, very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3523.4s	3523.4	 long standing, very deep, we don't know exactly how deep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3526.5s	3526.5	 relationship with Putin. And we did great work with we did, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3531.4s	3531.4	 mean, they did the he did his pageant over there. I'm making
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3534.5s	3534.5	 some jokes. They bought a lot of apartments. That was a joke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3537.0s	3537.0	 Okay, go on. Just a little joke there. But who knows? We'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3539.1s	3539.1	 find out over time, I suppose. Okay. But we did great work with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3542.0s	3542.0	 China in terms of containing North Korea's nuclear ambitions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3546.7s	3546.7	 right? And so there are things we can collaborate on. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3550.0s	3550.0	 the most important thing, though, is that while we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3552.2s	3552.2	 embracing them, building fabric between them, communication,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3555.1s	3555.1	 trade, whatever it is, we are not relying on them. And that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3558.4s	3558.4	 really what we have to look at when it comes to the kingdom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3561.0s	3561.0	 Because if not for the fact that the kingdom won the, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3565.0s	3565.0	 born on top of, you know, oil fields, lottery, we would not be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3570.5s	3570.5	 in a deep relationship with this country. They're living under a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3573.1s	3573.1	 10th century, you know, rule in terms of how they treat women,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3577.4s	3577.4	 gay people, etc. The human rights is an important issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3580.5s	3580.5	 And we wouldn't have a deep relationship with them if we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3582.5s	3582.5	 didn't have to deal with the oil, but we do. And so what I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3585.8s	3585.8	 think we really need to be focusing on here is maintaining
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3588.4s	3588.4	 great relationships with them. Yeah, we don't want to drive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3590.9s	3590.9	 them to each other's arms. But to Shomat's point, I don't think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3593.9s	3593.9	 they're creating the Legion of Doom to take on the US. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3597.1s	3597.1	 they're just doing what's in their economic interest. And we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3599.7s	3599.7	 need to do what's in our economic interest, which really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3601.6s	3601.6	 is investing in nuclear investing in solar batteries,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3604.5s	3604.5	 wind, and even and britch fuels, and in the interest of the free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3608.8s	3608.8	 world and Europe, exactly. And if we are independent of them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3613.5s	3613.5	 then we don't have to go over there and kiss the ring. Like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3616.6s	3616.6	 Biden had to do. We don't have to, you know, deal with excuses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3621.4s	3621.4	 When they do horrible things like murder Khashoggi, or, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3624.6s	3624.6	 know, just this past week, they put Sama al-Shahab in jail,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3628.8s	3628.8	 she's a PhD student from the University of Leeds. She's now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3632.2s	3632.2	 going to go to jail for decades, because when she went back to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3636.0s	3636.0	 Saudi Arabia on vacation, this happened last week, gentlemen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3639.4s	3639.4	 because she retweeted people. And so these human rights
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3642.0s	3642.0	 violations, the murder of Khashoggi, all these things add
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3644.0s	3644.0	 up the Uyghurs, etc. And we'll have a better ability to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3648.2s	3648.2	 negotiate and lead them as the shining city on the hill, when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3651.2s	3651.2	 we work on being that shining city on the hill, and we're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3654.4s	3654.4	 dependent on them. And that's really what I think we have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3656.4s	3656.4	 focus on is reducing the dependency on these countries. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3658.4s	3658.4	 think we all agree on whether it's medical devices, PPE,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3662.8s	3662.8	 drugs, making our iPhones or oil to keep us and then sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3667.4s	3667.4	 Europe. And that's where nuclear comes in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3669.3s	3669.3	 Speaking of reducing dependency, you know, Joe Biden signed the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3673.8s	3673.8	 Inflation Reduction Act, some people have said this is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3676.5s	3676.5	 most important bill signed in years, if not decades, by, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3682.7s	3682.7	 know, passed by US Congress signed by a president, because it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3687.0s	3687.0	 touches on so many points that folks believe will really move
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3692.7s	3692.7	 the needle with respect to climate change. Chamath, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3696.6s	3696.6	 you made an interesting point in our group chat. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3700.1s	3700.1	 maybe we should start there, which is, you know, at the end
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3703.6s	3703.6	 of the day, the systems of industrial production on planet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3708.0s	3708.0	 Earth were made in such a way that we never accounted for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3712.8s	3712.8	 costs of the external output of these systems, meaning we can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3718.8s	3718.8	 burn fuel, put CO2 into the atmosphere or put methane into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3723.0s	3723.0	 the atmosphere in the case of animal agriculture, and we get a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3726.3s	3726.3	 low cost product that we consume. And ultimately, no one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3729.8s	3729.8	 specifically pays for the cost of the carbon going into the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3733.0s	3733.0	 atmosphere, which I and you know, many scientists would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3736.5s	3736.5	 argue is having an anthropogenic effect on the warming of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3741.3s	3741.3	 planet and more catastrophic weather and all these other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3744.4s	3744.4	 risks that we're now facing. And so the idea was, you know, first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3748.6s	3748.6	 principles, you should tax people for tax industry tax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3752.8s	3752.8	 businesses for the production of atmospheric carbon that causes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3757.8s	3757.8	 an effect that we're all going to have to pay to repair over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3760.4s	3760.4	 time. So you know, is that a point of view that you hold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3763.8s	3763.8	 Chimav? Because you know, you kind of brought this up in our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3765.6s	3765.6	 group text, but that's the that would be the ideal scenario to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3769.7s	3769.7	 resolve climate change is if you just tax carbon, we kind of, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3773.3s	3773.3	 know, have a real solution here, and that this whole bill is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3776.4s	3776.4	 ultimately, you know, meant to kind of resolve the fact that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3780.6s	3780.6	 simply cannot find a way to a carbon tax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3782.4s	3782.4	 I actually think that what this bill did was kill the idea of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3786.1s	3786.1	 carbon tax, I think it makes it completely unimportant, and it'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3792.5s	3792.5	 never see the light of day. Why? I think it's because in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3797.4s	3797.4	 absence of what we did in the IRA, there wasn't a clear way of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3803.6s	3803.6	 doing exactly what you said, which is letting people figure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3808.2s	3808.2	 out what the equivalent trading price would be for burning a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3812.8s	3812.8	 pound of coal versus, you know, generating the energy needed to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3816.7s	3816.7	 run something off of nuclear, there was no market clearing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3819.6s	3819.6	 function for that. And the reason is because you couldn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3823.1s	3823.1	 get an equivalent amount of capacity effectively available
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3825.8s	3825.8	 online so that they could compete one for one. What we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3828.9s	3828.9	 did through this IRA was essentially use money to create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3835.1s	3835.1	 so many subsidies, and then to also green light, the way that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3839.9s	3839.9	 incremental fossil fuel projects would come to market. So that now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3844.6s	3844.6	 they actually going to be put on a level playing field in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3848.9s	3848.9	 broad open market so that they can compete. When that happens, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3853.1s	3853.1	 think you will make those trade offs better yourself. And as a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3856.2s	3856.2	 result, I don't think that there will be a necessary offset
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3860.0s	3860.0	 mechanism that will be required. Because this plan will still get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3864.0s	3864.0	 us to about 40% of the way there where we want it to be by 2030,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3867.5s	3867.5	 which is still a pretty decent leap forward. There is no plan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3871.7s	3871.7	 that gets us to where we all need to be anyways. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3875.3s	3875.3	 that the appetite to go from this plan to where we need to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3880.6s	3880.6	 doesn't really exist. So I think that we're just going to have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3884.2s	3884.2	 kind of grit our teeth, get through the implementation of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3887.5s	3887.5	 IRA, and realize that this is the beginning of a probably 100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3892.4s	3892.4	 plus year project, nothing's going to get solved by 2050.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3896.1s	3896.1	 Maybe you'll see something done by 2100, probably not. It'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3900.8s	3900.8	 probably be a 2150 2200 kind of an objective. And in that lens, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3906.1s	3906.1	 think like a whole bunch of business models got turned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3908.3s	3908.3	 upside down. So I think carbon markets and carbon trading are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3912.4s	3912.4	 not going to be the thing that we thought it was going to be. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3915.4s	3915.4	 think stuff like direct air capture, again, are going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3918.3s	3918.3	 toy projects off to the side. I don't think those are those are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3921.7s	3921.7	 not those are not going to be credible businesses totally like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3924.6s	3924.6	 we thought they were going to be. Instead, the raw tonnage of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3927.9s	3927.9	 dollars will do what America was able to do for solar and PV over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3933.8s	3933.8	 2000 to 2022, which is just crush the cost per watt into the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3938.3s	3938.3	 penny so that it can be equivalent to hydro coal and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3941.8s	3941.8	 nuclear and put everything on a level playing field, and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3945.3s	3945.3	 allow the market to figure it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3947.5s	3947.5	 Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of other stuff in this bill. I want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3952.1s	3952.1	 to highlight for you guys, I don't know if any of you looked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3954.5s	3954.5	 at the CBO. So the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3957.4s	3957.4	 anytime the bill is being voted on, they do an accounting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3961.9s	3961.9	 analysis on how much spending and how much revenue there will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3965.2s	3965.2	 be as a result of this bill for a 10 year period.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3967.2s	3967.2	 This is actually awesome. Yeah, I checked it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3969.3s	3969.3	 Yeah, if you look at every year for the next 10 years, the CBO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3972.2s	3972.2	 score for this bill is that we're going to spend an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3975.1s	3975.1	 incremental we're going to increase the deficit by $330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3978.5s	3978.5	 billion for the next five years. And then we're going to decrease
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3982.0s	3982.0	 the deficit by $320 billion in the five years after that. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3985.7s	3985.7	 the net effect over 10 years is we're only spending $17 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3989.2s	3989.2	 on the on the bill. And then on the revenue basis, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3993.3s	3993.3	 expectation is we're going to generate $67 billion in revenue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=3997.6s	3997.6	 in the first five years and then another $20 billion in the in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4000.2s	4000.2	 the back five years. So this is actually being accounted for and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4004.4s	4004.4	 presented as deficit reduction. And that's because there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4007.6s	4007.6	 87,000 new IRS agents being hired to go out and audit people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4011.5s	4011.5	 and find new revenue. And there's a 15% corporate minimum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4015.0s	4015.0	 tax being imposed on all companies. And what this means
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4018.5s	4018.5	 is that companies, public companies, private companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4020.4s	4020.4	 doing over a billion in revenue, historically pay taxes on a book
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4023.6s	4023.6	 basis. Now they're paying taxes on a financial statement basis,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4027.0s	4027.0	 meaning the actual accounting that they present to their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4029.4s	4029.4	 shareholders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4029.9s	4029.9	 Can I ask you guys a question? How much was given to the IRS?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4034.3s	4034.3	 87,000? Yeah, yeah, tens of billions. Yeah, 80 billion. How
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4038.5s	4038.5	 much do you think it would cost? I don't know, pick your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4042.1s	4042.1	 pick the pick the most excruciatingly expensive third
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4046.2s	4046.2	 party outsourcing firm you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4049.6s	4049.6	 Okay, to build an entire system to basically automatically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4055.8s	4055.8	 review every single tax return and throw exceptions and learn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4060.2s	4060.2	 and machine learn what fraud look like or what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4063.8s	4063.8	 misrepresentation, let's say $5 billion, it'd be the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4068.4s	4068.4	 expensive, it'd be the most expensive piece of software ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4071.7s	4071.7	 written. And this is what was so kind of like that was the only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4075.5s	4075.5	 part of the bill that made not a less sense to me. I think like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4078.6s	4078.6	 if you put really smart computers on the case, or gave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4082.2s	4082.2	 it to DeepMind at Google and said, Can you guys build this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4085.0s	4085.0	 system, or machine learning and AI, you'd be done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4088.5s	4088.5	 And a simpler tax, which I guess this is trying to do. But you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4090.9s	4090.9	 know, Freeberg, when I looked at this, and you sent it, my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4093.4s	4093.4	 initial reaction was, you know, this old adage,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4096.2s	4096.2	 it'll be impossible for these guys to find 87,000 humans that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4099.6s	4099.6	 want to work at the IRS.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4100.8s	4100.8	 Number one,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4101.5s	4101.5	 by the way, there's a funny video on the recruiting that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4103.2s	4103.2	 been going on for that. But yeah, go ahead. Yeah, it's pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4104.9s	4104.9	 good. But I mean, you know, they were asking for people who were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4108.0s	4108.0	 ready to like have guns and like be put their body in harm and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4111.2s	4111.2	 as I get the IRS, I was like, that can't be real. Anyway, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4114.6s	4114.6	 greatest, this is what I got from this Excel spreadsheet. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4117.7s	4117.7	 greatest tool for writing fiction is not Microsoft Word.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4121.0s	4121.0	 It's Excel. Like, there is no way this thing is netting out to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4124.0s	4124.0	 zero. Like, this thing's gonna cost us a fortune. Government is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4127.5s	4127.5	 in shambles. We don't know what we're doing. I thought that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4130.1s	4130.1	 links you sent for the podcast with the pros and cons of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4133.9s	4133.9	 carbon tax was really interesting, because it is so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4137.2s	4137.2	 complicated. When I heard these tax experts explaining how you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4140.8s	4140.8	 would implement a carbon tax, and the import and export and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4144.1s	4144.1	 then how often would have to be tweaked. And then who decides
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4147.3s	4147.3	 what your carbon footprint of your watches and where did the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4150.2s	4150.2	 minerals come from to make the watch and who gets paid on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4153.0s	4153.0	 carbon. It just seemed to me, this is a fool's errand. It'd be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4155.9s	4155.9	 much better to just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4157.0s	4157.0	 What if your watch is made from diamond and not carbon?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4160.1s	4160.1	 Well, in that case, you should just pay a million dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4163.3s	4163.3	 because you are coastal elite. We should just start with yachts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4168.8s	4168.8	 and watches. What I realized was, what we really need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4173.3s	4173.3	 focus on and you tell me if what you think, Friedberg, instead of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4178.1s	4178.1	 doing this carbon tax, which seems incredibly elegant, but we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4180.7s	4180.7	 all know is impossible to get consensus across hundreds of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4183.8s	4183.8	 governments and locales to negotiate this, it will never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4187.3s	4187.3	 happen, at least not effectively. And in real time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4190.5s	4190.5	 wouldn't it be a much better technique to do what we do in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4193.8s	4193.8	 venture, which is here are the biggest problems in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4196.7s	4196.7	 Here are the which in this case would be the biggest emitters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4199.0s	4199.0	 Here are the best solutions. Here are the teams working on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4201.0s	4201.0	 best solutions. Let's give the teams working on the best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4203.1s	4203.1	 solutions money to work down that list. And if it happens to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4206.8s	4206.8	 be, you know, ships coming from China, you know, with a bunch of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4210.3s	4210.3	 containers on them and container ships, we measure that and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4213.8s	4213.8	 know, the the thing I've learned after the first six months of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4216.9s	4216.9	 investing in carbon, because we have a syndicate now with Molly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4219.3s	4219.3	 Wood, who's working with me on this climate syndicate, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4223.2s	4223.2	 couldn't find a lot of great investments. You know, that made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4226.9s	4226.9	 sense that weren't, you know, asset heavy, but then we started
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4229.8s	4229.8	 to find, we found two great monitoring companies, and they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4233.4s	4233.4	 monitoring air pollution, and they're monitoring ship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4235.8s	4235.8	 pollution. And we made investments in both of those.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4238.6s	4238.6	 And that seems to be where we're at is we should be monitoring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4241.8s	4241.8	 and figuring out where the carbon is and then trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4243.7s	4243.7	 solve it based on which ones are the easiest to solve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4246.7s	4246.7	 Let me just say two things on that Bill Gates has done a great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4248.5s	4248.5	 job of this. You can read his latest book or go to Gates Notes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4251.2s	4251.2	 And he's done exactly what you described, which is break it all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4253.6s	4253.6	 down, show what we should do. And that's actually how he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4255.7s	4255.7	 investing his own money. He's putting his money where his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4257.5s	4257.5	 mouth is. So there's a really good blueprint for this. He's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4260.2s	4260.2	 done the best job of anyone I've seen. The issue with the carbon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4262.8s	4262.8	 tax is you have to come up with a consistent, reliable way of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4264.9s	4264.9	 measuring the carbon. And then you have to do it consistently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4268.0s	4268.0	 and broadly. How do you miss if you miss one factory or another,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4271.3s	4271.3	 then you have to ratchet up the price over time. So first thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4274.3s	4274.3	 is the challenge of how do you agree on measuring? Second is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4276.7s	4276.7	 how do you agree on broad accountability? Third thing is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4279.6s	4279.6	 how do you ratchet the pricing over time? Fourth thing is how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4282.2s	4282.2	 do you deal with the offshoring problem? As soon as you start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4284.5s	4284.5	 taxing companies in the US for carbon emissions, all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4287.2s	4287.2	 production is going to go offshore where they're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4288.6s	4288.6	 taxing for carbon emissions. And there's no way to account for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4291.0s	4291.0	 what they're doing offshore. And this has been the challenge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4293.6s	4293.6	 with China. There is there is because part of your first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4297.6s	4297.6	 Yeah, sorry, let me just hit the final one. We'll come back to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4299.7s	4299.7	 it. But the final big one is just the equity in carbon tax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4302.4s	4302.4	 People have said that the ultimate increment in cost of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4305.3s	4305.3	 production is going to adversely affect lower income people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4308.7s	4308.7	 because they cannot afford the price of some stuff going up by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4311.3s	4311.3	 25 to 50%. And it's really, you know, a luxury good luxury kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4317.3s	4317.3	 of privilege to be able to pay for the incremental cost of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4320.0s	4320.0	 stuff to account for the carbon offset needed. So that's that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4324.0s	4324.0	 the set of issues that have been pushed back against the carbon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4326.2s	4326.2	 tax. And it's why it's been impossible to get implemented.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4329.2s	4329.2	 And to really get into market. Sorry, Chamath, go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4331.8s	4331.8	 No, I was just going to say part of the problem in all of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4335.7s	4335.7	 issues, if you offshore is still that there's people pushing for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4338.0s	4338.0	 what's called the scope three accounting, which is like, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4340.6s	4340.6	 know, you got to go back to your supplier and your supplier,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4342.9s	4342.9	 supplier, and your supplier, supplier, supplier, and where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4345.6s	4345.6	 does it end? It's impossible. Where does it end? It's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4348.3s	4348.3	 credible. So you know, I think that the bill has actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4351.7s	4351.7	 cleaned up a lot of future question marks about what we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4355.8s	4355.8	 to do as a country to go about doing our part for climate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4359.3s	4359.3	 change. And I think it probably creates a reasonable blueprint
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4362.5s	4362.5	 for everybody else. And now they're gonna have to do some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4364.7s	4364.7	 version of the same thing. And what's amazing is that if we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4368.5s	4368.5	 actually pass this framework, which is still yet to be written
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4372.4s	4372.4	 around how to make permitting more seamless and efficient for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4376.9s	4376.9	 these hydrocarbon projects, it will really unleash a massive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4382.8s	4382.8	 torrent of both revenues back to the United States. It'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4387.0s	4387.0	 increase our national security. And it'll allow us to really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4390.9s	4390.9	 kind of put a dent in this thing, because it'll pull
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4392.7s	4392.7	 forward the amount of competition that it creates to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4396.7s	4396.7	 actually get off those hydrocarbons, which is a, I'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4399.1s	4399.1	 tell you, I got I got a notice from someone who's an investor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4402.6s	4402.6	 So there's a lot of climate tech funds now a lot of funds, J.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4405.3s	4405.3	 Kyle, you said you got a syndicate in carbon, but there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4407.2s	4407.2	 a lot of funds and a lot of investors that are putting a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4409.6s	4409.6	 capital just into early stage climate technologies, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4414.0s	4414.0	 travels everything from energy to materials to food, to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4418.3s	4418.3	 industrial and manufacturing and so on. And I got a note from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4421.5s	4421.5	 one of these these these companies, a startup that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4425.4s	4425.4	 highlighted that the dollar 25 per gallon credit, tax credit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4430.0s	4430.0	 for, you know, clean production of fuel, which kit which has to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4434.9s	4434.9	 demonstrate a 50% emissions reduction in the manufacturing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4438.0s	4438.0	 process will now make this startup profitable. And by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4441.3s	4441.3	 way, you get an extra penny per gallon for every 1% reduction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4445.2s	4445.2	 in emissions below that 50% threshold. And so there's a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4449.0s	4449.0	 of startups that I'm hearing about that their unit economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4452.8s	4452.8	 models were questionable before. Now because of this bill, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4456.2s	4456.2	 are flipping profitable. And so I personally think we are going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4459.5s	4459.5	 to see a significant influx of venture capital and support for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4463.8s	4463.8	 a lot of these climate tech and you know, new energy material
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4467.0s	4467.0	 and manufacturing projects that otherwise may have been held
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4469.4s	4469.4	 back, because the subsidy will kickstart. The question for me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4473.1s	4473.1	 that I still don't have a good answer to is are they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4475.5s	4475.5	 sustainable? Over the long run, if this bill gets shut down or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4478.6s	4478.6	 repealed, and the funding sources stop and the subsidy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4481.4s	4481.4	 stop, do these businesses survive? Or are we simply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4484.6s	4484.6	 creating regulatory capture models like we did with other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4487.4s	4487.4	 energy products in the past and with food?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4489.6s	4489.6	 If you're not contribution margin positive today, free this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4493.4s	4493.4	 bill in climate change. And the bill is the only way that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4497.2s	4497.2	 get there. Your DOA, you just don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4499.9s	4499.9	 Great point. Yeah. Sax, the biggest line in this bill is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4503.2s	4503.2	 corporate minimum tax. I don't know if you saw this, but 15%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4506.2s	4506.2	 minimum tax applied to the accounting profit reported by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4510.0s	4510.0	 any company over a billion dollars. And they're estimating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4512.5s	4512.5	 it'll generate 313 billion of incremental tax revenue over the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4516.6s	4516.6	 next 10 years. Do you have a point of view on whether this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4519.8s	4519.8	 corporate minimum tax is going to cause an issue with startups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4523.8s	4523.8	 and companies going public or the valuation in the public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4527.0s	4527.0	 markets? Or is this just, you know, hey, this should happen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4529.9s	4529.9	 and it doesn't matter. I mean, I don't know if you spent much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4531.4s	4531.4	 time on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4531.8s	4531.8	 Well, no, I mean, I think the the issue here is that why is it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4537.2s	4537.2	 that these companies are able to pay so little taxes? Well, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4540.2s	4540.2	 reason is because there's a zillion loopholes and incentives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4543.2s	4543.2	 and tax breaks in the existing code that they're taking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4545.4s	4545.4	 advantage of. I mean, these large companies have lots of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4548.4s	4548.4	 accountants and lawyers, they're not deliberately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4550.4s	4550.4	 violating the law, they're scrupulously adhering to it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4553.4s	4553.4	 taking advantage of it. So it's all these tax breaks that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4557.3s	4557.3	 they're able to use to pay no taxes. Well, what does this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4560.5s	4560.5	 bill do? You talk about the spending on climate, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4565.2s	4565.2	 the 386 billion, most of it is tax incentives, and some block
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4570.4s	4570.4	 grants. So this is now the preferred form of, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4573.7s	4573.7	 quote unquote, spending in these bills are tax credits and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4577.2s	4577.2	 incentives. This is the way they're going to change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4579.6s	4579.6	 people's behavior. So in other words, the bill on the one hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4582.7s	4582.7	 is complaining that corporations don't pay enough taxes because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4585.9s	4585.9	 there's too many tax breaks, while the other hand creating a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4588.4s	4588.4	 whole slew of new tax breaks. So there's a little bit of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4591.7s	4591.7	 contradiction there. Again, why do all why are companies paying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4594.4s	4594.4	 no taxes because of the last 10 bills tax breaks that were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4598.3s	4598.3	 supposed to move the behavior of businesses and consumers in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4602.6s	4602.6	 certain direction. So just recognize that that's the case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4607.1s	4607.1	 I think you also made a really good point about the phantom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4609.9s	4609.9	 deficit reduction here. So like you mentioned, when we see this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4614.1s	4614.1	 in lots of bills, all the excess spending all the deficit spending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4618.2s	4618.2	 occurs in the first five years, and all the deficit reduction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4620.8s	4620.8	 occurs in the last five years, something always intervenes to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4623.5s	4623.5	 prevent the the savings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4626.0s	4626.0	 Like startup, it's like startup projections, right, sex?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4628.9s	4628.9	 Yeah, it's like we're a sales guy, we're cutting the budget
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4632.0s	4632.0	 next year, you know. And so just to give one example of this. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4635.4s	4635.4	 this ACA subsidy extension, so this is the Obamacare subsets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4640.9s	4640.9	 about 60 something billion a year, they're extending it for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4643.6s	4643.6	 three years, but they're assuming it's going to die at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4646.3s	4646.3	 that point, as opposed to keep being extended. And no one's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4649.4s	4649.4	 going to want to vote to make that go away in three years, just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4652.0s	4652.0	 like they don't want to vote to make it go away now. So if you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4658.3s	4658.3	 alone makes the deficit reduction of this bill go from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4662.0s	4662.0	 305 billion over the 10 year period to negative 155 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4666.7s	4666.7	 So just that one item, if you continue it, and don't sunset
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4670.1s	4670.1	 it, just that one thing makes this a hugely deficit, not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4676.2s	4676.2	 reducing bill, but deficit increasing bill. And so you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4679.5s	4679.5	 wonder what problem is this bill really solving, and they can't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4681.9s	4681.9	 seem to agree on that. I mean, first, they're telling us, is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4684.5s	4684.5	 deficit reduction bill, then they're telling us it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4686.3s	4686.3	 climate bill, then they're telling us it's an inflation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4688.6s	4688.6	 reduction bill. It seems to me that if they're really proud of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4691.4s	4691.4	 this and believe in it, they would choose a name for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4693.7s	4693.7	 bill that actually reflected what it was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4695.7s	4695.7	 Well, all bills would be named something for everyone's sex. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4698.4s	4698.4	 mean, like that's how all these bills get in order to pass a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4700.9s	4700.9	 bill bipartisan bill, you got to give something to everyone. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4703.6s	4703.6	 mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4705.0s	4705.0	 but this is mostly, you know, this is mostly a climate related
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4708.9s	4708.9	 bill. You know, this is mostly this is mostly tax breaks, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4713.1s	4713.1	 block grants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4714.4s	4714.4	 I mean, there's a huge tax issue with the IRS agents and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4718.4s	4718.4	 corporate minimum tax, but there's also a huge component on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4721.4s	4721.4	 prescription drugs. Chamath, I don't know if you spent any time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4724.3s	4724.3	 looking at this, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4725.1s	4725.1	 sorry, just on the IRS agent, can I just say add one detail on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4728.0s	4728.0	 that? Yeah. So the claim of the administration and the sponsors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4731.4s	4731.4	 of the bill is that this would not increase taxes on any one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4734.9s	4734.9	 sort of middle class. And so the Republicans, I think, is one of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4738.8s	4738.8	 the few politically smart things they did. The interest in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4741.2s	4741.2	 amendment, basically prohibiting these new 87,000 IRS agents from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4745.7s	4745.7	 conducting audits of anyone making less than $400,000 a year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4749.6s	4749.6	 which was what Biden said, you know, he wouldn't increase taxes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4753.1s	4753.1	 anyone below 400,000. That amendment was rejected on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4756.0s	4756.0	 straight party lines. So this idea, yes, it's called the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4759.3s	4759.3	 Crepo Amendment. It was 5050. And Vice President Harris had to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4763.1s	4763.1	 come in and make the tie breaking vote. So obviously,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4766.4s	4766.4	 they know that there's gonna be a lot of net new audits on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4769.8s	4769.8	 people making less than four. Yes, exactly. So the next time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4774.4s	4774.4	 my understanding of this is it's like small business owners,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4776.6s	4776.6	 people who run a small business and a service business, and are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4779.6s	4779.6	 they really accounting for their books correctly? Are they really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4782.0s	4782.0	 expensing the right things, etc? Are they accounting for all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4785.2s	4785.2	 their revenue? They're gonna get whammied by this because look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4790.0s	4790.0	 let's face it, billionaires are already getting audited. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4792.3s	4792.3	 know, Elon had a tweet saying, listen, I get audited as a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4794.9s	4794.9	 matter of course, every year, you know, these people already
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4798.0s	4798.0	 have said, yeah, dude, I use a big four accounting firm. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4802.5s	4802.5	 I mean, the amount of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4804.8s	4804.8	 partners crazy. I have a partner like Anderson that is literally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4808.4s	4808.4	 like, you know, covered, like it comes a fortune 500 fucking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4811.4s	4811.4	 company might as well be in your office, put them in your, your,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4814.2s	4814.2	 your put them in your unit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4817.4s	4817.4	 I mean, by the way, sax sax is right. Like, if you look at them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4821.4s	4821.4	 you know, the ultra wealthy, I think it would be I would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4825.6s	4825.6	 shocked if any of those folks were actually evading taxes at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4829.7s	4829.7	 all, because it's impossible the way that this infrastructure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4832.2s	4832.2	 runs, like, you know, you're getting k ones from Blackstone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4835.2s	4835.2	 what are you gonna do? Are you gonna change that? Like, totally,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4838.4s	4838.4	 you know, like, do you guys even know the pin number of your bank
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4841.2s	4841.2	 card? I have no idea. So like, so complicated. Yeah. Okay, so so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4845.3s	4845.3	 my point is, I don't think that if there is if there is cheating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4849.2s	4849.2	 of taxes, it's happening at that level. What's happening at that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4853.2s	4853.2	 level are much more structural issues like carried interest,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4855.9s	4855.9	 which they decided not to touch, or in a state law, trust in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4859.3s	4859.3	 state law. Those are those. No, I don't think that this is my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4862.2s	4862.2	 point. It's not mistakes. There's nobody with a pencil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4864.5s	4864.5	 really filling out a K one for Bill Gates, dummy. That's my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4867.9s	4867.9	 point. No, I know. But people can make mistakes. What if a K one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4871.7s	4871.7	 gets left off? That's what I'm saying is when they find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4873.6s	4873.6	 something, it's usually easily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4876.1s	4876.1	 happen. Doesn't happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4878.9s	4878.9	 tax return. It's it's done by an accounting firm and I just sign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4882.2s	4882.2	 it. I don't know. I know that what I'm talking about is what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4884.6s	4884.6	 are the IRS people going to find is, you know, I'll tell you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4887.7s	4887.7	 what they're going to find, they're going to find a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4890.0s	4890.0	 this, they're going to find a lot of middle class and upper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4892.8s	4892.8	 middle class folks. And they're going to have to focus on them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4896.0s	4896.0	 Because individually, it may not represent a lot. But when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4900.3s	4900.3	 multiply it by the number of people inside the United States,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4903.3s	4903.3	 and this is what the Wall Street Journal and a bunch of other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4905.8s	4905.8	 folks have been saying now, when you apply 87,000 people and task
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4911.0s	4911.0	 them incrementally with doing a job, it's not going to touch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4915.0s	4915.0	 these folks that are already audited, it's going to touch the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4917.5s	4917.5	 folks that are not audited. And by and large, a much, much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4921.4s	4921.4	 larger majority of middle income and upper middle income people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4924.6s	4924.6	 are not audited, which is why I think you could spend a lot less
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4928.8s	4928.8	 than $80 billion and just build software that guarantees only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4932.6s	4932.6	 those that should be audited are and uses machines to help figure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4936.5s	4936.5	 out these leaks or start simplifying the tax code. Because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4939.2s	4939.2	 when you add this 15% minimum Friedberg, what is that going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4942.8s	4942.8	 do to the strategy of a public company? Okay, so we should show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4946.4s	4946.4	 less earnings, put more to work, oh, we're not going to be able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4948.8s	4948.8	 to depreciate this or, you know, whatever. I mean, it's going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4951.4s	4951.4	 create all these second and third order impact impacts that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4954.0s	4954.0	 we don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4954.8s	4954.8	 Well, I think Sachs's point is important, which is one that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4957.6s	4957.6	 don't yet have insight into, which is what is this going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4960.0s	4960.0	 cannibalize? Because ultimately, if there is a minimum tax, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4963.8s	4963.8	 doesn't make sense to pursue incentives that create a tax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4968.0s	4968.0	 break today. And therefore, those incentives won't be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4971.1s	4971.1	 invested in whatever those incentives are, I don't know what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4973.6s	4973.6	 they are, you know, low income manufacturing zone development,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4977.5s	4977.5	 or whatever, who knows, you know, what they are, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4981.4s	4981.4	 come and build your business here and get tax breaks, etc,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4984.2s	4984.2	 etc. Local, state and federal tax breaks, if those start to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4989.2s	4989.2	 written over, then there's going to be really adverse effects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4992.9s	4992.9	 And I think that that's something to watch. I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4994.7s	4994.7	 understand it well enough. Certainly, I'm not an accountant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=4997.4s	4997.4	 But I would be kind of worried about and keeping an eye on that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5001.0s	5001.0	 front. I do think the bigger question, which is a biotech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5004.3s	5004.3	 one, the prescription drug price cap minimizes the profits that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5008.7s	5008.7	 a number of pharmaceutical companies will be making. It
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5012.2s	5012.2	 gives authority to go and negotiate prices. This is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5014.8s	5014.8	 second largest line in the bill. And there was a survey done by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5021.2s	5021.2	 health affairs.org on an R&D survey, which said, will you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5025.4s	5025.4	 guys reduce your investment in new drug development? And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5031.5s	5031.5	 think that they can based on this bill, and I think that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5034.6s	5034.6	 came up with some estimate that there would be two, the number
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5040.1s	5040.1	 two, fewer drugs that would be kind of, you know, made available
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5044.5s	5044.5	 per year, because of reduced spending as a result of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5049.0s	5049.0	 price cap, which basically reduces revenue, which will, in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5052.2s	5052.2	 essence, reduce R&D investment. You know, guys like Bernie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5055.8s	5055.8	 Sanders will say, hey, that's not true, all that money is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5058.8s	5058.8	 going to share buybacks and dividends, and so on. But it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5063.1s	5063.1	 a fact that those share buybacks and those dividends will still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5066.0s	5066.0	 continue. And if they are reduced, so will the R&D
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5068.9s	5068.9	 expense. And if the R&D expense is reduced, fewer drugs will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5072.1s	5072.1	 come to market. And so you know, there's also a question mark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5076.2s	5076.2	 And people will debate this for the next decade, which is how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5079.4s	5079.4	 much will this prescription drug price cap actually have an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5082.9s	5082.9	 effect on R&D investment and ultimately on new drugs that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5085.4s	5085.4	 come to market? My personal opinion, sorry, let me just say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5088.0s	5088.0	 my personal opinion is I don't think that this will have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5090.5s	5090.5	 huge effect. I think this is an excellent part of the bill. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5092.9s	5092.9	 think that the government should have authority to go and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5094.6s	5094.6	 negotiate. They're the largest buyer of these drugs. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5096.9s	5096.9	 typically when the US government, the federal government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5098.8s	5098.8	 steps in to be the largest spender on a particular line,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5102.3s	5102.3	 the cost of that line balloons, like we've seen in healthcare,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5107.0s	5107.0	 like we've seen in education, and like we've seen in military
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5111.9s	5111.9	 and defense spending. And so I'm hopeful that this will actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5115.5s	5115.5	 provide a more effective market force in allowing the biggest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5119.5s	5119.5	 customer in the market to negotiate prices. And that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5123.8s	5123.8	 the VCs instead of making 48% IRR, they'll ultimately make 28%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5128.3s	5128.3	 IRR on the investments that they're making in biotech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5130.6s	5130.6	 startups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5131.6s	5131.6	 Well, hold on. What exactly does it mean for the government to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5135.6s	5135.6	 negotiate prices as opposed to the government just to fix
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5138.5s	5138.5	 prices? I mean, is this is price fixing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5141.4s	5141.4	 Well, in this example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5143.2s	5143.2	 what do you think is the right answer if they're the largest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5145.0s	5145.0	 single largest customer sacks, right? I mean, you know, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5148.0s	5148.0	 they are the market. I mean, what's the right thing to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5152.0s	5152.0	 Well, I mean, you're saying that these drug companies are going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5156.6s	5156.6	 to make a lot less money. Well, obviously, that's going to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5158.5s	5158.5	 a downstream impact in the willingness to fund new drugs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5163.4s	5163.4	 new investment, new R&D. Yeah, yeah. Now, no one likes pharma
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5166.4s	5166.4	 companies. I'm not defending exorbitant profits or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5168.9s	5168.9	 But I don't really know what it means for the government to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5171.0s	5171.0	 they're negotiating. I mean, the government just tells you what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5174.4s	5174.4	 it's going to be. That's price fixing. And these companies are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5178.7s	5178.7	 going to adjust. Yes, the government will pay less money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5181.9s	5181.9	 in the near term. In the long term, there could be reduced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5184.5s	5184.5	 investment in R&D.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5186.4s	5186.4	 I think there'll be a balance of you know, do you don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5189.3s	5189.3	 want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5189.5s	5189.5	 government Shamath, don't all governments I know that you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5192.5s	5192.5	 close to some of these drug companies, don't all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5195.4s	5195.4	 governments negotiate the purchase of these drugs. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5198.8s	5198.8	 then if they don't like the price, there are alternative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5201.3s	5201.3	 drugs. And they'll say, Hey, listen, your drug is too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5203.6s	5203.6	 expensive compared to these other two solutions. So we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5205.4s	5205.4	 going to buy this one primarily for our universal healthcare.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5208.9s	5208.9	 There's this interesting thing that happens, which is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5211.0s	5211.0	 there's a there's these drugs that are proprietary and under
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5214.2s	5214.2	 patent. Okay. These could be chemical drugs, or they could be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5217.8s	5217.8	 biologics, okay. And eventually, what happens is when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5222.0s	5222.0	 they go generic, then folks will step in and make lower cost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5226.2s	5226.2	 versions of those generics, like, you know, I mean, I'm on a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5228.6s	5228.6	 statin, I think a couple of you guys are on a statin, like I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5231.0s	5231.0	 don't, it's, it's Lipitor, but it's not Lipitor, right? It's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5235.3s	5235.3	 torvastatin. It's like some generic drug that I just take,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5238.7s	5238.7	 okay, as an example. And there's a lot of folks that make that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5243.6s	5243.6	 and the cost of those pills basically go to zero. But there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5246.7s	5246.7	 a bunch of categories, particularly for biologic drugs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5249.0s	5249.0	 where it's very different, it's very difficult to make out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5251.4s	5251.4	 what's called the bio similar, this is a generic drug. So long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5255.2s	5255.2	 and short of it is there's all these classes of drugs that kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5258.1s	5258.1	 of like standalone without enough competition. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5261.6s	5261.6	 there are two ways to solve this problem. One is where the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5263.8s	5263.8	 government steps in, which I think is good, but the better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5268.3s	5268.3	 way has already is already been happening in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5271.1s	5271.1	 So, you know, there's a nonprofit, which is a collective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5273.7s	5273.7	 between a bunch of hospitals called Civica. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5276.8s	5276.8	 that's a really interesting example. And what those guys do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5279.3s	5279.3	 was they said, we're just going to create our own generic drug
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5282.4s	5282.4	 manufacturer, and we're going to make the drugs we want, we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5285.0s	5285.0	 just going to make them super cheap. And you know, they're in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5287.9s	5287.9	 the midst right now of completing a massive facility. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5291.7s	5291.7	 think it's in Virginia, where they'll be able to make as much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5295.1s	5295.1	 insulin as is needed for the entirety of America, for no more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5300.3s	5300.3	 than 35 bucks a dose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5302.4s	5302.4	 That's gangster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5303.4s	5303.4	 That's gangster. It's super gangster. We'll make our own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5307.4s	5307.4	 And by the way, when California said they're going to make their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5309.7s	5309.7	 own, what they really meant was that they're going to go and RFP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5313.0s	5313.0	 it out. And my hope is that they end up going with somebody like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5317.0s	5317.0	 Civica, who has the experience of actually building it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5319.8s	5319.8	 Otherwise, it's just gonna California is just going to waste
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5322.2s	5322.2	 hundreds of millions of dollars proposal if you don't know what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5324.4s	5324.4	 RFP is request for proposal. Yeah. But there are these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5327.0s	5327.0	 emerging nonprofits that are basically doing the work of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5331.6s	5331.6	 government. I think that's a better solution to what sax is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5334.1s	5334.1	 actually competition, right? Yeah, it's kind of creates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5336.0s	5336.0	 competition. Yeah, competition.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5371.0s	5371.0	 No, that's what you're doing was a CNN anchor who on zoom

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5407.3s	5407.3	 right? I'm starting to sell things. I decided I'm going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5410.2s	5410.2	 sell the Warriors I sell it to a large private equity fund in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5415.3s	5415.3	 November, December. And then we had to wait for them to close
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5419.0s	5419.0	 the second fund and then we sold the rest of it and it closed in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5421.4s	5421.4	 June or July. And then I put out this tweet right like thanking

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5428.7s	5428.7	 like I thank Peter Thiel and I thank Joe Laker. Everybody is

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5436.5s	5436.5	 like I you know, he had this issue with how it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5439.4s	5439.4	 characterized that how he had introduced me or something where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5442.4s	5442.4	 he wanted credit for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5443.9s	5443.9	 the tweet storm he should have been higher up or you know, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5446.9s	5446.9	 I was like, well, Phil, what if it hadn't made me money? Would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5449.0s	5449.0	 you have just made me whole? Like, what would you have done?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5451.7s	5451.7	 Like, it's like you're like the architect of this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5453.7s	5453.7	 Anyways, I was so mad. I just said, I'm not talking to this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5457.8s	5457.8	 dipshit anymore. I'm done with him. I'm done. I'm breaking up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5460.2s	5460.2	 with him. And he would call me when I was in Europe. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5463.3s	5463.3	 would ignore and I would get this incredible enjoyment from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5466.1s	5466.1	 just pressing to to voicemail. He would send me text messages
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5469.4s	5469.4	 ignore. And then I mean, this is always happens this way. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5474.4s	5474.4	 did it once and Nat caught me. She's like, why did you ignore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5476.7s	5476.7	 his phone call? And I said, I hate Phil. I'm done with Helmuth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5480.6s	5480.6	 I told her the story. She got so fucking mad at me. And then I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5484.7s	5484.7	 had to send this text. I'll just read you the text because I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5487.6s	5487.6	 think it's just so fucking hilarious. I was going to ignore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5490.4s	5490.4	 you for the rest of my life, based on your tantrum with me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5493.7s	5493.7	 earlier this year. But Nat has convinced me to see where you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5497.0s	5497.0	 are coming from in part. Anyways, we're good. Call me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5500.1s	5500.1	 later. He called me once. I was waiting. He had your decks open.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5506.6s	5506.6	 I get this picture Nat. Me amore. He's your friend. Why do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5509.9s	5509.9	 you gotta be such a jerk? He's a friend. You have no friends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5514.3s	5514.3	 All your friends are going away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5517.6s	5517.6	 Anyways, back in the good with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5520.5s	5520.5	 Okay, we got to play poker. We do need to get a poker game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5523.8s	5523.8	 Before we wrap, Sax is going to give us instead of doing science
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5526.4s	5526.4	 corner, we're gonna do Mar-a-Lago corner. Tell us what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5530.4s	5530.4	 it's like Sax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5531.4s	5531.4	 Yeah, what is Mar-a-Lago like? You've had your membership now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5534.1s	5534.1	 for 18 months?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5534.5s	5534.5	 Never been there. Never been there. But no, I wanted to I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5538.6s	5538.6	 want to give a shout out to this article. Last week, I took some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5542.8s	5542.8	 heat because somehow I guess you're not allowed to question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5545.8s	5545.8	 anymore the rectitude of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover's FBI were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5549.5s	5549.5	 not allowed to question anymore. A lot of people feel that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5552.6s	5552.6	 There was an article that came out in real clear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5554.7s	5554.7	 investigations just I think yesterday. And what it exposed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5559.2s	5559.2	 is pretty amazing. The group, the unit within the FBI that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5563.6s	5563.6	 conducted the raid on Mar-a-Lago is the the same group that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5568.6s	5568.6	 conducted the investigation into Trump back in 2016, that lied to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5573.6s	5573.6	 the FISA court that had its members, its leaders Peter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5577.3s	5577.3	 Struck were fired for basically wrongdoing, whose members are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5582.4s	5582.4	 actually under investigation right now by the special counsel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5585.6s	5585.6	 John Durham. And you've got people who are on probation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5588.9s	5588.9	 right now. So this is the same unit that basically conducted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5592.0s	5592.0	 the raid on Mar-a-Lago. So I think there's still more to come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5594.8s	5594.8	 out about this. But it's just amazing to me actually that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5597.9s	5597.9	 Christopher Wray, the head of the FBI, and Merrick Garland, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5600.3s	5600.3	 head of the DOJ, thought that this wouldn't create the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5604.2s	5604.2	 appearance of a conflict of interest or impropriety. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5607.7s	5607.7	 fact that you've got the same unit that previously was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5611.9s	5611.9	 disciplined for wrongdoing in an investigation of Trump is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5615.8s	5615.8	 one conducting the raid on Mar-a-Lago. So pretty amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5619.1s	5619.1	 J Cal retort.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5621.1s	5621.1	 I'm sorry what we're talking about. No, I'll tell you. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5625.0s	5625.0	 brutal. No, I just want to make a couple of child actors. Oh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5630.3s	5630.3	 look at these. They're on camera. Look at these props.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5632.5s	5632.5	 Amazing. Good work. Nice props. Beautiful. And that's what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5636.5s	5636.5	 you're seeing there. Hold on, Saks. Before you get back to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5638.6s	5638.6	 Trump, what you're seeing there is a family unit. This is when a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5641.8s	5641.8	 family gets together and expresses love towards each
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5644.0s	5644.0	 other, but continue about Mar-a-Lago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5645.7s	5645.7	 No, that's wonderful. That's wonderful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5648.9s	5648.9	 You could take a picture of this, and you could send it to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5651.6s	5651.6	 your friends on Christmas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5652.9s	5652.9	 All right, Jason, you are, you do not accept the real clear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5656.7s	5656.7	 investigation report that maybe there is some long term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5662.2s	5662.2	 I have actually some feedback. It's nothing to do with Saks. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5664.8s	5664.8	 just think a lot of times I get positioned as sometimes when I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5669.5s	5669.5	 moderating, I like to challenge Saks. Last week, I chose to stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5672.3s	5672.3	 out of it. I let him go. And I think one of the reasons people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5676.2s	5676.2	 didn't like your comments last week, Saks was other than, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5679.6s	5679.6	 know, J.R. Groover being dead for 50 years, putting that aside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5682.5s	5682.5	 and it being irrelevant. I think the reason people didn't like it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5685.4s	5685.4	 was because I didn't come back at you and question some of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5688.0s	5688.0	 things you were saying. And so I think they felt it was an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5690.6s	5690.6	 unbalanced discussion. They expect me to do that. But I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5692.6s	5692.6	 don't want to be pinned as the adversary to Saks's positions in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5697.0s	5697.0	 every case, because I'm an independent, I'm a moderate, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5699.6s	5699.6	 voted for public vote, I voted Democrat my whole life, I voted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5703.1s	5703.1	 for both of those parties. But I do think that what's happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5708.2s	5708.2	 here is, you know, Trump is under five different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5711.2s	5711.2	 investigations. He's got a career of doing disgraceful,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5713.6s	5713.6	 criminal, fraudulent things. And I feel very bad for GOP friends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5718.1s	5718.1	 I feel bad for Republicans, because they have to carry water
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5720.6s	5720.6	 for him. And it's they they put themselves in this really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5724.2s	5724.2	 difficult position of defending him. And you know, we've talked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5727.4s	5727.4	 on this podcast about January 6. We talked about voter fraud. My
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5732.3s	5732.3	 good friend, one of my besties, David Saks said he doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5734.7s	5734.7	 believe that the election was there was election fraud. And he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5737.0s	5737.0	 doesn't. He thought January 6 was disgusting. I'm not speaking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5740.1s	5740.1	 for you. That's what you said. And so I think, you know, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5743.4s	5743.4	 fact that the Republicans feel the need to defend him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5746.2s	5746.2	 constantly, is one of the big problems here. And I think, on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5749.4s	5749.4	 the other side, the fact that the media is forcing Republicans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5753.2s	5753.2	 to defend him and creating this narrative and this hysterics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5755.6s	5755.6	 like, Oh, my God, see, SBA espionage act, he's doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5758.3s	5758.3	 espionage. This might be very simple. Trump lied, cheated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5762.4s	5762.4	 stole his whole career from Trump University to what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5765.6s	5765.6	 happening with, you know, the Trump Corporation now, with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5769.5s	5769.5	 CFO, and his nonprofit, this is his life is a history of griffs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5775.6s	5775.6	 and crimes and unethical behavior. What the GOP needs to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5778.7s	5778.7	 do is stop defending him, and just let him go off into the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5782.1s	5782.1	 sunset as sex pointed out last week. And that's what this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5784.3s	5784.3	 podcast needs to do. Because there's no reason for me to sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5786.9s	5786.9	 here and do the left wing talking points, or for you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5790.1s	5790.1	 sacks to do the right wing talking points. The fact is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5792.8s	5792.8	 first principles, Trump's a grifter. He's a Democrat, who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5797.2s	5797.2	 do the GOP. That's it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5798.9s	5798.9	 My point is not to defend every shady deal that Trump's ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5802.3s	5802.3	 done, or even to defend Trump at all. My interest is having a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5806.5s	5806.5	 DOJ and FBI that's not politicized, and is not used as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5810.1s	5810.1	 a political weapon or to pursue political targeting or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5813.0s	5813.0	 vendettas. And the reality is, at some point, we're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5815.9s	5815.9	 move past Trump as a country. But the precedents that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5818.5s	5818.5	 created now are going to stick with us for a long time. And the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5821.7s	5821.7	 reality is, we should not have an FBI and a unit within the FBI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5826.1s	5826.1	 that is pursuing these political vendettas. And in this article
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5830.2s	5830.2	 by Real Clear Politics, the amazing thing, yeah, the amazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5833.0s	5833.0	 thing is Christopher Wray prohibited this unit from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5837.0s	5837.0	 seeking warrants from the FISA court. So he knew there was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5840.8s	5840.8	 enough misbehavior last time to basically prohibit them. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5844.9s	5844.9	 seems to me that's a very narrow takeaway. It seems to me that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5847.6s	5847.6	 the takeaway should be, we don't allow this unit to pursue Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5851.1s	5851.1	 again, because they committed so much wrongdoing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5853.0s	5853.0	 Yeah, it would be cleaner to have a clean unit, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5855.3s	5855.3	 Why wouldn't they do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5856.6s	5856.6	 Yeah, if it's true, because that is from a biased source. And if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5859.6s	5859.6	 it is true, then it would be good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5861.1s	5861.1	 I mean, Real Clear Policy is kind of like a politico.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5863.0s	5863.0	 Look, guys, this has been a lot of fun. J. Cal, thank you for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5866.2s	5866.2	 letting me sit in your seat today. Yeah, you did great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5869.0s	5869.0	 Oh, I appreciate that. It was it was a lot of fun. Maybe Saks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5871.9s	5871.9	 would like to have a run in the seat at some point here. He
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5873.8s	5873.8	 doesn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5875.9s	5875.9	 For your as your guest moderator for today, I'm Dave

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5907.2s	5907.2	 That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5915.0s	5915.0	 We should all just get a room and just have one big huge

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5920.4s	5920.4	 that they just need to release.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nId3Jy5bjrY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=30&t=5921.8s	5921.8	 What?
