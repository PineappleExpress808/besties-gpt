https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=0.0s	0.0	 What the ffff...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1.3s	1.3	 What are you wearing, Jason?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2.9s	2.9	 What?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3.5s	3.5	 Oh, Uber had a big week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4.5s	4.5	 So this is the Uber Moncler crossover hat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=6.9s	6.9	 Oh, look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=7.7s	7.7	 And I also bought a Moncler shirt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=9.4s	9.4	 You bought that or I sent it to you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=10.7s	10.7	 Oh, what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=11.5s	11.5	 You got the watch and the mug?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=13.2s	13.2	 Oh, you don't know about the Apple Moncler watch?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=18.7s	18.7	 Or the commemorative mug?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=21.8s	21.8	 Or the new tach?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=23.5s	23.5	 You don't know about the new neck tats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=25.0s	25.0	 that are coming from Moncler?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=26.3s	26.3	 It's actually a new neck tach?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=27.3s	27.3	 Oh my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=30.5s	30.5	 So good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=31.3s	31.3	 Let's just say somebody got their biquette.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=33.8s	33.8	 I'm not saying that I got a hundred thousand dollar sponsorship,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=37.8s	37.8	 but we don't have a rule in the agreement about logo placement, do we?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=43.4s	43.4	 Listen, J. Cal, if anyone was willing to sponsor you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=46.0s	46.0	 every square inch of your clothing will be covered in ads like a race car driver.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=50.4s	50.4	 It is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=51.1s	51.1	 Look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=51.4s	51.4	 You'd be like wearing a jumpsuit every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=53.0s	53.0	 These, you know, Moncler sponsorships are great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=55.0s	55.0	 This is five, five dollars plus seventeen dollars of shipping from France on its
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=59.8s	59.8	 Etsy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=61.3s	61.3	 I'm ready to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=78.8s	78.8	 How was everyone's week?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=79.8s	79.8	 What did you guys do this week?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=81.6s	81.6	 Just busy working, trying to be helpful where I can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=85.7s	85.7	 And that'll be the extent of my comments today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=87.8s	87.8	 How is Market Street this time of year?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=89.6s	89.6	 Look, there's all sorts of wild reports.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=91.0s	91.0	 I've gotten all sorts of inbound from people asking me if I'm like leaving craft ventures
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=95.3s	95.3	 to do something at Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=96.5s	96.5	 No, it's not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=97.3s	97.3	 We're just, Jason and I are just pitching in and helping out while Elon establishes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=101.3s	101.3	 his permanent team at that company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=103.8s	103.8	 Elon's the CEO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=105.0s	105.0	 He's running it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=105.8s	105.8	 He's the decider.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=106.6s	106.6	 He's making the decisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=108.1s	108.1	 And some of us are just kind of helping out in any way we can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=110.9s	110.9	 And that's really the extent of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=112.1s	112.1	 It's a, you know, very much part-time thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=115.4s	115.4	 We're just helping a friend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=117.0s	117.0	 But it's been like blown up by the media into something much more than it actually is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=121.4s	121.4	 It is a hundred percent accurate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=122.9s	122.9	 I am still doing my day job, podcasting, investing in a hundred companies a year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=127.1s	127.1	 just helping out on the margins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=128.8s	128.8	 That's it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=129.8s	129.8	 The end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=130.2s	130.2	 I do want to try talking about one issue that's already public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=133.2s	133.2	 because it's already been tweeted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=134.9s	134.9	 So Elon had a tweet this morning about how there's now like an advertiser boycott going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=141.0s	141.0	 And this falls on the heels of a bunch of reports that came out over the last couple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=144.9s	144.9	 of days that supposedly there's been a big influx of like racist tweets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=150.8s	150.8	 And Jason and I actually saw what was really going on, which was it's all not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=155.3s	155.3	 I mean, what happened is that within hours of Elon taking over the company on Friday,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=159.4s	159.4	 there was a 4chan attack where basically people from this message board created bots
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=164.3s	164.3	 to post hundreds of thousands of spam messages that contained racist words and epithets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=170.0s	170.0	 And within hours, this has been detected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=172.9s	172.9	 And Yoel, who runs the trust and safety implementation, he met with me and Jason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=179.0s	179.0	 and Elon directed him to shut it down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=181.3s	181.3	 And Yoel actually posted a tweet storm about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=183.8s	183.8	 That's the only reason I feel comfortable talking about it is because you already
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=188.3s	188.3	 posted the tweet storm, but maybe people haven't seen it or they haven't connected all the dots
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=192.6s	192.6	 here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=192.8s	192.8	 But what's really, I think, unfair about this is that as you've seen, it's not like your feed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=199.6s	199.6	 was all of a sudden filled with racist things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=201.2s	201.2	 These were spam accounts or bot accounts that were posting to zero followers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=205.9s	205.9	 They generally have zero followers or if they do have followers, it's other bot accounts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=209.9s	209.9	 So they're posting racist tweets into the ether, so to speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=213.7s	213.7	 It's not degrading anyone's experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=215.9s	215.9	 It was shut down promptly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=217.0s	217.0	 But then what happens is these activist groups, they're monitoring the fire hose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=222.5s	222.5	 And so they publish a report saying that racist tweets have gone up 500%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=226.9s	226.9	 since Elon took over Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=228.9s	228.9	 The truth is, Elon hasn't even had a chance to change anything about the content moderation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=233.9s	233.9	 policies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=234.4s	234.4	 He's posted that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=235.4s	235.4	 Like, guys, I haven't even changed anything about content moderation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=239.1s	239.1	 Whatever the rules are, they're the same rules that existed prior to him taking over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=245.0s	245.0	 And this is just an organized operation by people who want to create that report.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=250.3s	250.3	 So then these activist groups basically publish this report.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=253.4s	253.4	 They feed it to news outlets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=254.7s	254.7	 And then somebody then takes those reports and then feeds them to advertisers and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=259.2s	259.2	 get a boycott.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=260.2s	260.2	 But I think the point here is that Elon didn't do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=263.9s	263.9	 This is being manufactured by people who are not operating in good faith.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=267.7s	267.7	 They are trying to manufacture an incident that they can then use to hurt the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=271.9s	271.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=272.6s	272.6	 And it was thwarted immediately and fixed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=274.7s	274.7	 Have you guys seen episode 333 of the Lex Freeman podcast?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=278.5s	278.5	 He interviews Andrei Karpathy, who is really, I mean, one of the great minds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=285.1s	285.1	 of our time, particularly around AI and ML.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=287.6s	287.6	 And the question that Lex asked, which Andrei expounded on, which I think is really interesting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=294.2s	294.2	 is what does the next generation of bots look like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=298.2s	298.2	 And I think where the problem gets very hard for all platforms, so this is not a Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=305.0s	305.0	 specific discussion, is that you can now generate such real life-like human images that are unique.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=313.0s	313.0	 And you can also generate high quality text to things like GPT-3.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=318.1s	318.1	 That's also, you know, that can essentially push the boundaries of, you know, a low level
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=324.4s	324.4	 Turing test.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=326.3s	326.3	 I think the real problem over time for bots, for spam, for coordinated attacks on any platform,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=333.8s	333.8	 is that when you use these tools, you're going to have to become very sophisticated in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=338.4s	338.4	 how you try to detect them and then to block them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=342.7s	342.7	 It's a really interesting discussion between, you know, two pretty meaningfully smart people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=347.4s	347.4	 Karpathy was the head of autopilot at Tesla, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=351.5s	351.5	 Autopilot vision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=352.2s	352.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=352.4s	352.4	 So he's really smart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=353.4s	353.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=353.8s	353.8	 I have no doubt that Elon is going to do a much better job stopping bots on Twitter once
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=359.8s	359.8	 he has a chance to do it, because he's got this amazing team of AI engineers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=365.5s	365.5	 And he's just going to be more focused on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=368.0s	368.0	 You know what I like the most about what I heard this week is the idea that you can do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=372.9s	372.9	 either micro payments or subscription to third-party content providers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=376.6s	376.6	 Because I think so much of my news feed is delivered to me through the Twitter app.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=381.5s	381.5	 And then I click on an article and then it's like a paywall, or it's some sort of difficulty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=386.6s	386.6	 in kind of accessing the content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=388.3s	388.3	 Having some integration there or some ability to kind of make a micro purchase to read an article
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=393.5s	393.5	 is going to be, I think, a super feature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=395.4s	395.4	 The other thing that I would love Twitter to experiment with is if you have a micro
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=399.2s	399.2	 payments model to publishers, it would be great if you could publish content without a byline,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=404.2s	404.2	 a la the economist, and see what that does to information quality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=408.4s	408.4	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=408.7s	408.7	 You know, if you do not get any credit to your individual name for writing stuff,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=414.6s	414.6	 but instead it goes to the masthead publication, whatever it is, the Times, the Post,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=419.8s	419.8	 I think it could have a really important behavior change in how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=423.3s	423.3	 journalists cover the news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=425.1s	425.1	 It's worth experimenting with, at least.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=426.6s	426.6	 And if you're paying them enough money, I think that you could probably demand that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=430.2s	430.2	 Facebook could probably demand that today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=432.3s	432.3	 You know, strip the byline away and just it just says New York Times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=435.4s	435.4	 Just like today, it just says The Economist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=437.8s	437.8	 Yeah, it is a the Economist is a very polarizing gig in journalism for that reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=443.8s	443.8	 There are going to be actually a lot of journalists who would prefer to have their byline taken off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=449.4s	449.4	 One of the problems with journalism today is even if you're doing reporting in Good Faith,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=454.0s	454.0	 Jamoth, and you put your byline on there, harassment, threats, etc. can become very acute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=460.0s	460.0	 if you're just covering certain topics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=461.9s	461.9	 And so I actually think a lot of writers and journalists would opt into this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=466.2s	466.2	 They might prefer it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=467.4s	467.4	 I think they should because I think the two ends of the spectrum are better than this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=471.7s	471.7	 gross middle that we have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=472.8s	472.8	 The end of the one end of the spectrum is you have the New York Times,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=476.6s	476.6	 The Washington Post and The Economist with no byline and no attribution to reporters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=480.8s	480.8	 The other end is if you want to build a brand that's based on your name, go start a substack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=486.2s	486.2	 And I think that there's a very good balance there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=488.0s	488.0	 And the New York Times could syndicate that as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=490.6s	490.6	 But if you separate the two, all of a sudden, the news becomes more likely to be truthful news versus,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=496.0s	496.0	 you know, well disguised opinion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=498.6s	498.6	 The other issue is, you know, for readers, if you do choose to do a no byline publication,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=504.5s	504.5	 you really get any time to build trust and for people to understand what you're doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=508.2s	508.2	 because they will think you're taking the byline off in order to pursue a certain agenda.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=512.7s	512.7	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=513.0s	513.0	 So that is the suspicion that can build up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=515.7s	515.7	 The Economist has been able to do this over decades with trusted reporting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=519.3s	519.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=519.7s	519.7	 And substack proves that you can have no reputation whatsoever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=523.2s	523.2	 And if you're publishing great content, you can build a great business from scratch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=526.7s	526.7	 So, you know, you don't need to you don't need to pay your dues,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=529.8s	529.8	 quote unquote, by getting a byline at the New York Times to be a clever writer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=534.5s	534.5	 You can start that business today and get paid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=536.3s	536.3	 So I think the New York Times should just focus on being the New York Times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=539.8s	539.8	 And substack should focus on individual people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=542.6s	542.6	 And I think if you could clean up the middle, that would be much better for all of us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=546.0s	546.0	 Anyways, I'm excited for you guys to help out and pitch in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=548.9s	548.9	 I hope you guys do some good with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=550.2s	550.2	 I'd love to come back and use Twitter more often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=552.2s	552.2	 Can we talk about the reporting that happened with the two guys that trolled the journalists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=558.9s	558.9	 and pretended to be fired employees?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=560.6s	560.6	 Because I actually thought that was such an interesting moment this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=564.4s	564.4	 That all the journalists immediately parroted it because it fed their narrative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=568.6s	568.6	 But there was no fact checking done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=570.2s	570.2	 There was no reporting done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=571.8s	571.8	 And then several of them, including, I think, Deirdre Bosa from CNBC,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=575.0s	575.0	 came out and publicly apologized for that report.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=578.2s	578.2	 And if folks listening aren't familiar with what happened, these two guys came out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=583.2s	583.2	 They pretended to be fired Twitter employees on Monday, walked out with a box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=587.3s	587.3	 Oh, what's funnier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=588.8s	588.8	 And they were like, hey, we just got fired.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=590.2s	590.2	 It's terrible. Life is awful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=591.6s	591.6	 No, it's even worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=592.3s	592.3	 Husband and wife, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=595.0s	595.0	 One guy's name is Rahul Ligma.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=597.2s	597.2	 And the other guy's name was Mike Johnson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=599.6s	599.6	 So the whole thing was Ligma Johnson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=601.6s	601.6	 So I, now here's what's so funny about due diligence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=605.2s	605.2	 Hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=606.0s	606.0	 I read this story without giving away that punchline to my kids.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=611.4s	611.4	 All my kids immediately started howling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=613.6s	613.6	 They're like, dad, if you say these two names are Ligma Johnson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=617.6s	617.6	 And I was like, oh my god.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=619.0s	619.0	 And so when pre-teens can figure this out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=623.8s	623.8	 but the journalism industry could not is kind of a very telling sign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=627.4s	627.4	 Freberg made the key observation, which is they didn't figure it out because they didn't want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=630.5s	630.5	 to because it fit their narrative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=631.8s	631.8	 So they don't fact check things that fit their narrative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=634.8s	634.8	 Paul Matz This was my point about journalism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=637.3s	637.3	 It was so poignant to me this week when this happened,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=640.6s	640.6	 particularly as it relates to Twitter and the importance of call it open journalism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=646.2s	646.2	 or citizen journalism and the integrity of kind of, you know, of the voices that we all kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=651.3s	651.3	 trust as our kind of journalistic authorities, that these guys came out and they were pond
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=656.2s	656.2	 right outside Twitter's offices into telling a story that fit their sensational narrative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=660.6s	660.6	 And it was really a kind of poignant moment for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=662.4s	662.4	 Pete Slauson Well, do you remember that story?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=664.2s	664.2	 I think it was originally in Rolling Stone and then Rachel Maddow amplified it where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=667.8s	667.8	 it was in Oklahoma City where supposedly all these MAGA Republicans were eating horse paste
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=672.3s	672.3	 because Trump told them to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=673.8s	673.8	 And they were, and this is basically, I thought it was like a COVID therapy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=676.7s	676.7	 And then they were going to the emergency rooms of all the hospitals and then they were turning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=680.1s	680.1	 away heart attack victims because there are so many of these people going to the emergency room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=684.2s	684.2	 Anyway, it all turned out to be like a made up story, like a hoax, but the media reported
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=689.4s	689.4	 it because the story was too good, right? It just, it fit too many of their preconceptions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=693.5s	693.5	 Too many of their priors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=694.2s	694.2	 Paul Matz Well, there's also one, there's another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=695.8s	695.8	 vector of sex, which is live coverage is, you know, you really have to be careful because when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=701.8s	701.8	 doing live, people will call in and say, oh, they're at the scene of an accident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=705.4s	705.4	 And then they will do a ba-ba-booey or whatever, you know, kind of charades.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=709.7s	709.7	 And so without fact checking and without saying, hey, we haven't confirmed this yet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=714.9s	714.9	 but these two employees are claiming this. People want to get real time coverage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=719.3s	719.3	 It's fine to do real time coverage. I think everybody in the audience has to understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=722.6s	722.6	 Jason Suellentrop You're giving them so much credit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=724.0s	724.0	 What about the copy editor? There was a picture and it said, Ligma Johnson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=727.9s	727.9	 Paul Matz Of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=728.8s	728.8	 Jason Suellentrop The editor went with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=729.8s	729.8	 Paul Matz That was the worst one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=730.6s	730.6	 Jason Suellentrop No, that is so lazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=732.9s	732.9	 Paul Matz Jesus, why are you covering for these people?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=734.7s	734.7	 Paul Matz I'm not covering. I'm just trying to explain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=736.6s	736.6	 Jason Suellentrop The point is, no, you're missing the point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=737.6s	737.6	 Paul Matz You need to let me unpack the whole point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=738.8s	738.8	 Let me unpack the whole point. There's also-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=740.6s	740.6	 Jason Suellentrop You interrupted me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=741.4s	741.4	 Paul Matz Well, here's the thing. There is a different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=743.3s	743.3	 standard for live news coverage. And then we've ripped out fact checking from a lot of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=747.0s	747.0	 publications and basic fact checking and a little bit of time. I'm explaining why they make this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=751.8s	751.8	 mistake. I'm not protecting them. The reason they make it, that's part of it, but they've also ripped
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=756.8s	756.8	 out fact checking and then they are in such a race to get the clicks on social media.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=761.6s	761.6	 Jason Suellentrop No, no, here's what's going on. If the story fits their priors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=765.6s	765.6	 they run with it immediately and they don't do any fact checking because they don't want to know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=769.0s	769.0	 that it's not true. That's what's going on. They will fact check a story if it's a narrative they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=773.9s	773.9	 don't like because they're going to try and make sure it's not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=777.1s	777.1	 Paul Matz Yeah, that's true of both sides and they'll use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=778.9s	778.9	 proxies as well. Jason Suellentrop No, you're both
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=779.4s	779.4	 sides in this thing. There's only one mainstream media. This is the mainstream media. Who's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=784.5s	784.5	 alternative? What's the alternative? Substack? Paul Matz Fox is the number one network.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=789.2s	789.2	 Jason Suellentrop The alternative to the mainstream media is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=791.0s	791.0	 the Substack Journalists. You think Substack Journalists do this? Tell me the writer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=795.5s	795.5	 tell me the writer on Substack who behaves this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=797.8s	797.8	 Paul Matz There's a lot of different ones there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=798.8s	798.8	 Jason Suellentrop Who got fooled? What Substack writer got fooled by Ligma Johnson?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=802.5s	802.5	 Paul Matz I'm not defending it. I'm explaining what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=809.0s	809.0	 happened. Jason Suellentrop I'm not defending it. Don't make me defend Ligma.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=814.6s	814.6	 Paul Matz You're both sides in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=817.4s	817.4	 Paul Matz I'm not both sides in it. I'm telling you what is happening in journalism today. They
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=821.3s	821.3	 have ripped out fact checking and they are in a race to beat each other because the first person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=825.7s	825.7	 the story up gets the clicks. That's a dysfunctional thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=828.1s	828.1	 Jason Suellentrop They tried to create a story when there was no story there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=831.0s	831.0	 Paul Matz I agree with that as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=832.2s	832.2	 Jason Suellentrop They went and camped out outside of an office,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=834.6s	834.6	 mid-market street, and they said, hey, there's this sensational thing happening. And there was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=839.1s	839.1	 no sensational thing happening. And so the little drop that fell into their laps, the little thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=844.6s	844.6	 that fell into their laps became the story because that's the story they wanted to see created. There
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=849.0s	849.0	 was no story beforehand that there were all these people being fired, walking out with boxes, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=853.4s	853.4	 then they said, let's go send live TV producers down there. They sent the live TV producers down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=857.5s	857.5	 there. And then the story was manifest. Paul Matz They did the same thing in New York at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=863.0s	863.0	 Bear Stearns. When they had other major layoffs at Bear Stearns and stuff like that during the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=867.7s	867.7	 financial crisis, of course, they sent people to do live coverage there. Not defending it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=871.1s	871.1	 I'm just explaining to you what's going on in the background as well with live TV and the gutting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=875.4s	875.4	 of newsrooms and having no fact checking. A lot of these stories go out. But what about the copy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=879.3s	879.3	 editor? They used to have fact checking. Paul Matz Guys, my 11 year olds and 10 year old kids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=883.5s	883.5	 are better copy editors than these adults at these incredible publications. My kids started
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=890.0s	890.0	 howling. They were like, Dad, do you understand what you just said? It'll ligma jumps. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=895.8s	895.8	 come on. This is like prepubescent humor that these people fell for. It's ridiculous. It's embarrassing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=901.7s	901.7	 Paul Matz It's certainly embarrassing, 100%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=903.6s	903.6	 It is embarrassing. And this connects with the 4chan board. It's the same problem. This is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=908.9s	908.9	 a grievance industrial complex, right? They're manufacturing grievances. It's funny in the case
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=914.1s	914.1	 of ligma Johnson. It's not funny in the case of the 4chan board. But these are people who are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=918.6s	918.6	 inventing stories. Because there's a certain narrative to manipulate media, because they know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=923.7s	923.7	 it's so easy to manipulate the media. Right. Anyways, big shout out to Rahul ligma. That was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=927.7s	927.7	 a great stunt. Paul Matz Also happens to be a huge fan of the all in podcasts, apparently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=932.6s	932.6	 Paul Matz Well played, sir.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=933.4s	933.4	 Paul Matz He's welcome on as a bestie gusty anytime he wants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=935.8s	935.8	 Paul Matz Oh, no, no, definitely not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=937.2s	937.2	 Paul Matz Well played.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=937.8s	937.8	 Paul Matz All right, we should talk about layoffs in tech. Lyft, 13%,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=942.3s	942.3	 RIF, 700 employees like oh, yesterday. Stripe, 14% RIF, 1000 employees, Open Door Chime,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=949.4s	949.4	 Dapper Labs, all hundreds of employees. Open Door, the most significant there, 550, 18%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=956.4s	956.4	 Dapper, 22%. And Twitter, we'll see what the RIF winds up being. But that's occurring as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=961.8s	961.8	 we're taping here. So and then Jason Apple did a pause. Amazon did a pause. Right. And Google and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=968.6s	968.6	 Facebook have Yeah, maybe trying maybe signaling a pause, but haven't they've been hiring like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=977.1s	977.1	 absolutely. And in crazy, crazy pace, and we'll pull up the chart here, actually, it's instructive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=981.5s	981.5	 to look at Facebook and Google because they have not slowed down by any stretch of the imagination.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=987.3s	987.3	 Paul Matz Just by the raw numbers, this all started to peak in June, and now is starting up again. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=994.6s	994.6	 there's a website, layoffs.fyi that's been tracking all these layoffs, you can see the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=999.9s	999.9	 number of layoffs, these are kind of major layoffs, and the number of employees impacted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1004.6s	1004.6	 I'm pretty consistent. In the third quarter, it started to die down in September.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1011.8s	1011.8	 From the peak in May and June, and now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1014.0s	1014.0	 Jason Apple This is going to be picking up, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1016.1s	1016.1	 Yeah, it feels like this is the double dip we were talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1018.8s	1018.8	 Paul Matz I think this is the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1020.3s	1020.3	 This is not even unpack it. Well, I think that we had if you take a very balanced view of what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1024.7s	1024.7	 happened this week, you have to start, I think, with the Federal Reserve. And really, what they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1030.5s	1030.5	 said is, rates will probably be higher than all of you think. And they'll be higher for longer than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1036.6s	1036.6	 all of you want. And again, without debating whether, you know, that's going to come to pass or not,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1044.1s	1044.1	 the thing that you can do is you can build a little sensitivity model to understand the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1050.1s	1050.1	 mathematical implication of it. And basically, what it means is that the dollar that's right in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1055.2s	1055.2	 front of you is now meaningfully more important than the dollar that's far, far away from you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1060.2s	1060.2	 So let's just assume that, you know, the Fed funds rate goes to five and a half percent or so,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1067.4s	1067.4	 even five, let's let's let's go to the optimists and say it's only going to go to five.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1072.1s	1072.1	 Tech companies have to achieve 500 basis points above that minimum. So we all have to generate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1077.6s	1077.6	 10 to 11% returns for us to be on a risk adjusted basis, better than a government bond.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1085.1s	1085.1	 The problem with that is all of a sudden, you know, if you're trying to generate cash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1088.5s	1088.5	 even three or four years from now, it's not worth that much, you need to generate dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1094.3s	1094.3	 today. And so, you know, they are really reprioritizing the value of short term profits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1101.0s	1101.0	 And that's going to affect how companies get money, the cost of capital, so how much dilution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1106.6s	1106.6	 you have to take. So I think this is what companies are now bearing down for they're realizing, oh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1112.6s	1112.6	 man, I need to get my cost structure way in line. It is way better now just to think about this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1119.0s	1119.0	 contrast, it's way better to grow at 20% and be profitable than it is to grow at 100% and burn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1125.0s	1125.0	 money, because it's not clear where that second company is going to get the incremental dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1129.5s	1129.5	 they need for growth. And that's just the mathematical realization when rates are 5%,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1134.1s	1134.1	 risk free rates are 5%. So this is this is that moment where you see that pivot from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1138.5s	1138.5	 pivot growth to profit. Yeah, we can talk we've been talking about it for six months. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1144.4s	1144.4	 this is this is this is how it is manifest in Silicon Valley companies is of scale is through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1151.2s	1151.2	 layoffs and cost reductions and cost savings. So the investments in future growth are reduced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1157.8s	1157.8	 And the timeline to drive greater profits is improved. I think what if what Elon is going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1165.7s	1165.7	 to do a Twitter or what is reported, so this is nothing to do with anything anyone told me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1170.7s	1170.7	 just what I've read in the reporting is accurate that he's going to cut so deep, he's going to cut
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1175.7s	1175.7	 30 4050% potentially of the employee base, it really sets a new standard for how profitable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1183.4s	1183.4	 a tech company can get. And again, I'll give credit to a Twitter poster named post market,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1188.0s	1188.0	 who I didn't give credit to a few weeks ago, when I read this tweet, which I think was a good one,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1194.0s	1194.0	 which was that Elon is really going to show everyone just how profitable these tech companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1198.5s	1198.5	 can be just how lean they can be run. And you know, when you're doing a 10% riff or a 13% riff,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1205.4s	1205.4	 you may or may not even be getting to profitability with that rep. When you cut 30 4050% deep,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1212.0s	1212.0	 and you can actually turn a real profit on a business and enterprise scale business,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1216.2s	1216.2	 like a Twitter or like many other enterprise software companies that are out there right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1220.8s	1220.8	 it really kind of sets a new standard that a lot of folks might then end up saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1224.1s	1224.1	 you know what, maybe we should go deeper. And there could be the case that private equity firms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1229.0s	1229.0	 take a look at this. And there's a lot of these distressed mid cap and small cap software companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1233.1s	1233.1	 out there, that private equity firms now realize, wow, you don't actually need 50% of the workforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1240.4s	1240.4	 in order to keep the product running and to drive the profitability. And you could see a bit of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1244.6s	1244.6	 flurry of buyout activity, as more folks come in, and maybe try and mimic the Elon playbook. So you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1251.7s	1251.7	 know, that's one kind of prediction I think may arise if Elon is successful in making Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1257.1s	1257.1	 a much more profitable enterprise, it could set a new model that catalyzes a lot of other M&A
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1262.6s	1262.6	 activity, a lot of other buyout activity of these distressed small and mid cap companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1267.2s	1267.2	 by other actors. Can I build on what you're saying? Nick, could you please just throw up that tweet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1273.1s	1273.1	 that I sent just for all of these guys to look at? Because I think it's incredible. So to your point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1276.6s	1276.6	 this is an incredible slide. This is an incredible slide. And essentially what it shows for those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1281.4s	1281.4	 folks that are not watching this on YouTube is it essentially shows the private software universe,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1288.6s	1288.6	 and then the public software universe at different levels of valuation. So as an example, right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1295.3s	1295.3	 there are 15 companies, private companies that are valued greater than $10 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1301.0s	1301.0	 And there are 40 public ones that are valued greater than 10 billion. There are 50 companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1306.5s	1306.5	 between, you know, more than 5 billion, but only 60 that are public that are valued more than five.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1314.1s	1314.1	 And here's what's crazy, there are 400 companies who have an average valuation of 3 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1321.8s	1321.8	 And then there are already 70 companies in the public markets where they have a billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1326.9s	1326.9	 dollars of next 12 months of revenue. And it just goes to show you to your point, Freeberg,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1333.9s	1333.9	 if these folks have to generate an 11% hurdle rate, their cost of capital is 11%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1341.1s	1341.1	 The companies on the left will have to go through a lot of very difficult cost cutting, potentially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1347.4s	1347.4	 headcount reductions, you know, repricing of the product, all kinds of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1355.4s	1355.4	 No, not none of them have. Oh, have these many of these are on the left tracker,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1359.4s	1359.4	 you're on the left, right? 400. There's almost 500 companies here that have to do an enormous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1364.8s	1364.8	 amount of work so that they have a chance to be on the right hand side of this chart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1368.7s	1368.7	 The point is that you didn't have to do this when rates were zero, there was just an abundance of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1373.8s	1373.8	 free money and risk seeking and duration that is now out of the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1378.6s	1378.6	 Jamath, I think there's also a story that of the 200 companies that are software,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1382.9s	1382.9	 public software companies that you see on the right, some number of them will need to go private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1387.7s	1387.7	 in order to do the restructuring that the market is demanding that they do in order to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1391.7s	1391.7	 rightly valued. And to your point, it will happen at meaningfully lower valuations than where they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1397.0s	1397.0	 probably went public or their last round, which will put enormous pressure. Yeah, as you guys look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1403.2s	1403.2	 at these 200 companies on the right, how many of them do you think go private over the next 18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1407.4s	1407.4	 months to get restructured? Allah, what Elon is showing everyone is possible Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1413.0s	1413.0	 18 is 18 months is hard to predict. But to your point, Fieberg, I think if you look at the number
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1417.8s	1417.8	 of them that are unprofitable, at least half of them will have difficulty and about so I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1424.2s	1424.2	 about two thirds of these companies really have no line of sight to profitability in the next two to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1429.1s	1429.1	 three years. And again, if you if you layer in this cost of capital argument, all of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1434.8s	1434.8	 companies, David will have to raise money at very egregious terms in order to keep themselves going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1443.0s	1443.0	 as a public business, in which case their alternative is to go private in a P E transaction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1448.8s	1448.8	 So it's probably at least half these businesses. I mean, it's a lot. There's 100 P E deals to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1454.2s	1454.2	 done. Yeah, 100. Wow, sex. What do you think? Because you know, these businesses and the models,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1459.5s	1459.5	 I mean, some of them, it's hard to get profitable if you're scaling SaaS business, right? Like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1463.8s	1463.8	 you have to get to a certain scale before it's possible. Well, I don't I don't that's like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1468.6s	1468.6	 very specific question of like, how many of them are going to get acquired by PE firms versus going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1473.4s	1473.4	 public or going private after being public. That's that's like a very specific question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1477.9s	1477.9	 I think the larger point is just that it feels to me like the economy is headed off a cliff right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1482.4s	1482.4	 now. I mean, I can tell you within our larger portfolio of companies, like I can see the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1489.0s	1489.0	 trajectory. So after Q1 board meetings, I would say about two thirds of portfolio companies were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1495.4s	1495.4	 hitting their numbers and one third were missing. And it still appeared to be like problems related
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1500.5s	1500.5	 to those specific companies, not a macro trend. I would say after Q2 board meetings, two thirds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1506.2s	1506.2	 were missing and one third were hitting their numbers. And you could start to feel, okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1509.8s	1509.8	 maybe there's like a macro trend here. And I would say after Q3 board meetings, like now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1516.4s	1516.4	 the entire portfolio is re forecasting. Maybe there's like a handful of companies here or there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1521.4s	1521.4	 that aren't if you're one of those, congratulations. But like even the best companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1525.8s	1525.8	 are portfolio now are seeing major headwinds. And this is just, I think, an economy wide slowdown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1531.1s	1531.1	 Do you think there's restructuring possible? I mean, can these companies?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1533.8s	1533.8	 Well, they're going to have? Yeah, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1535.5s	1535.5	 let me just ask in the public markets, do you think those public companies can get restructured
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1539.8s	1539.8	 as public companies in order to? Yeah, well, yes, of course, it just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1544.2s	1544.2	 really expensive. Well, it's expensive. I don't even think it's will. I think it's just expensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1549.6s	1549.6	 Yeah, I mean, Coinbase as an example, like look, take Coinbase versus Carvana, right? These are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1554.8s	1554.8	 both businesses that issued convertible that sort of right before things got very, very hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1561.8s	1561.8	 And if you look at where their convertible debt trades, it's trading basically at an implied yield
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1566.6s	1566.6	 of about 12 or 13%. Both companies now, one is probably, you know, a legitimate bankruptcy risk,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1573.6s	1573.6	 which is Carvana. That's what the market would think. Whereas the other one, you know, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1577.6s	1577.6	 it has a very fortified balance sheet and could weather the storm Coinbase. But unfortunately,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1583.0s	1583.0	 in a moment where, you know, rates are, again, the risk free rate goes to five, five and a half,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1588.8s	1588.8	 our cost of capital to do business goes to 10 or 11. These guys have to pay 12 or 13%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1594.6s	1594.6	 My gosh, it's really, really dilutive to be in business right now. So it just goes to show you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1600.3s	1600.3	 that you can stay public. But if you want to get incremental money to cover your burn, the only way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1606.9s	1606.9	 you can do it without really, you know, blowing up your cap table and doing a massive recap,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1613.0s	1613.0	 will be through convertible debt. But it has a huge overhang. And you risk turning the keys over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1619.0s	1619.0	 to the debt holders of the company. So the alternative for that business is to go into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1624.2s	1624.2	 the hands of private equity and get out of the spotlight of these public markets. But public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1631.0s	1631.0	 private equity is very smart. And the thing that's happened to them is they can't raise debt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1637.2s	1637.2	 Right. So what do you think they do? They just have to pay 50% less than what they would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1640.7s	1640.7	 willing to pay before because they have to write, you know, 100% equity check. So there is no free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1647.0s	1647.0	 lunch anymore, I think is the big is the big point to point out anywhere in the market right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1652.3s	1652.3	 I think one of the things I'm most concerned about or would be is I was talking with a friend who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1657.0s	1657.0	 works at a private, you know, unicorn software company. And he we talked about the numbers of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1663.7s	1663.7	 the business and I was like, Oh, that company is probably worth X and I gave them a number.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1667.4s	1667.4	 And then I asked him how much money they've raised and they've raised more than X. So I was like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1672.2s	1672.2	 dude, your options are worthless. Like, you know, this is a real problem, I think that's probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1676.3s	1676.3	 going to become very systemic. For scaled unicorn software companies, what happens to these businesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1682.2s	1682.2	 sacks in the market? You know, as they kind of need another round, but the value of the company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1687.9s	1687.9	 is now less than the total cash that they've raised that all is sitting as preferred stock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1692.6s	1692.6	 Listen, it's survival of the quickest those who are most willing to adapt the most quickly are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1698.7s	1698.7	 going to survive and the ones that are stubborn and refuse to accept the new regime, the market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1703.4s	1703.4	 regime are going to die. We showed that chart. Remember that chart from Sequoia months ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1708.5s	1708.5	 on this podcast? Remember that where it basically showed what happens if you're a company that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1713.9s	1713.9	 doesn't cut burn until the very end, then you're still going to run out of money and die. But if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1717.9s	1717.9	 you make the cut right away quickly, you have enough runway to weather the storm. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1724.3s	1724.3	 that what we've seen is, you know, at my firm, Kraft, yeah, this is exactly it. Yeah, we showed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1729.2s	1729.2	 this months ago. We've been begging our founders to embrace this. We did a portfolio, a review with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1734.7s	1734.7	 our entire set of founders of our portfolio companies. We did one in February when we felt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1740.8s	1740.8	 the markets were changing and we did another one in May and we showed the slide. And this is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1745.5s	1745.5	 most important thing for founders to internalize is you have to make the changes quickly. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1750.8s	1750.8	 one way for them to think about it is let's say you're a unicorn company, okay, and you raised
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1755.2s	1755.2	 at the peak, let's say second half of 2021, you raised $100 million at a billion dollar valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1760.8s	1760.8	 And let's say you've got 50 million left in the bank, right? So you've burned 50 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1765.2s	1765.2	 A lot of these founders are thinking that 50 million they've got left is only 5% dilution,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1769.4s	1769.4	 but that's what it was historically. If you were to raise a new round today, you might only be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1773.8s	1773.8	 valued at 250. So that 50 million you have left is actually 20% dilution. And that's if you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1780.2s	1780.2	 even raise, which might be very, very hard. The most important thing founders can do is forget about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1786.0s	1786.0	 the historical terms on which you raise that money, forget about how much money you were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1790.7s	1790.7	 burning in the past. Just think about how much money you have in the bank today, impute evaluation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1796.1s	1796.1	 to it. So you really internalize how much dilution that money represents and then create a new plan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1801.9s	1801.9	 moving forward to preserve that cash as long as possible. Can I say something else quickly on top
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1806.5s	1806.5	 of this? I think that's really good advice. The thing that again, people should do is you should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1813.1s	1813.1	 just build a little spreadsheet for yourself to understand what the alternative financing options
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1819.4s	1819.4	 are for people who are in the business of investing. So David, to your point, the current three month
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1824.6s	1824.6	 T-bill rate is 4%. You know, you can buy munis now between 4% and 5% that are triple tax advantaged,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1832.9s	1832.9	 right? You can buy high quality corporate bonds that are six, seven, 8%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1838.1s	1838.1	 And so it's very- You can buy stocks that have a dividend yield of 5% of growth, growing market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1843.6s	1843.6	 leading companies. Growing. And so all of a sudden- 5% dividend yield. Exactly. And so all of a sudden,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1848.2s	1848.2	 like turning around and giving it to a company where there is no end in sight in terms of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1853.0s	1853.0	 it doesn't get you to profitability is a really, really hard thing to do. I was talking to an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1858.1s	1858.1	 entrepreneur, David Soloff, just yesterday, and he said it really well. He's like, listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1864.7s	1864.7	 you know, I'm not a macro economist. I'm not trying to forecast, but he's like, what I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1869.4s	1869.4	 understood yesterday, this is David talking about the Fed, as an entrepreneur, the angle of attack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1875.4s	1875.4	 has changed. The Fed has said, this is not going to be some triangle sawtooth. It's not going to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1881.0s	1881.0	 up sharply and then come back down sharply, which is what we would all want. If we wanted things to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1887.5s	1887.5	 get back to normal sooner, the angle of attack is now a little bit slower, which means it's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1893.5s	1893.5	 to take longer to get where we need to be. And then we're going to stay there for a lot longer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1898.0s	1898.0	 than we want. And when you roll those two things together, a lot of companies may run out of money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1904.2s	1904.2	 And so if you can't get to default alive, you have to look at your cost structure and figure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1909.3s	1909.3	 out how to right size this thing, because the cost of capital is just going to be really,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1914.6s	1914.6	 expensive. And this was the Fed's goal, right? They wanted to take away this free capital,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1919.0s	1919.0	 they want to slow the economy down. And it seems like they're making progress. They did the 75
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1923.1s	1923.1	 basis point hike this week, but we're adding jobs to the economy, we have more job openings, and we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1929.8s	1929.8	 had 2.6% GDP growth. So I guess my question to the everybody here is, what is the Fed going to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1937.8s	1937.8	 to do? Or can they stop this consumer and this growth? It's very strange, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1943.8s	1943.8	 Powell, Powell said he'd rather overcorrect and break things because he has a toolbox to fix the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1950.6s	1950.6	 broken bones. But he doesn't have a toolbox to fix if they under correct and they have rampant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1956.4s	1956.4	 inflation. I mean, not more explicit, you can't get Jason. So he's going to take rates until demand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1963.2s	1963.2	 is destroyed, and enough demand is destroyed, such that inflation is tamed. But that has huge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1969.1s	1969.1	 implications to all of us, because we all have to do our job, trying to build a company trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1974.3s	1974.3	 raise money trying to invest money. It's just getting much, much, much harder than I even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1980.4s	1980.4	 thought. So like, you know, for me, I'm like, wow, I thought that we could get through the worst of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1985.0s	1985.0	 this by mid 23. But now you have to plan for the worst, which means, okay, now I'm thinking that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1990.6s	1990.6	 man, rates could be higher, for much longer, which means, you know, we could be in this market till
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=1996.3s	1996.3	 early 25. And you may say, hey, that's way too conservative. Yeah, but you have to plan for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2001.9s	2001.9	 conservatism in this point. So how do I invest money right now? Honestly, I'm like, hmm, I should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2007.7s	2007.7	 just put more into t bills. Isn't that crazy? If a company's like HMF can have another 10 1520 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2013.1s	2013.1	 bucks, I'm like, wow, I mean, I don't think that that gets you anywhere. And oh, by the way, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2017.8s	2017.8	 10 or $20 million, I can generate 4%. What a what a tough trade off, right? For well, for somebody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2023.8s	2023.8	 who has access to private markets, which should be high growth companies to take the guaranteed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2028.6s	2028.6	 for over the 50 x 25 x 10 x, whatever we're trying to bet on here. Yeah, that's not just the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2035.2s	2035.2	 guaranteed for but if you want to take tech risk, then you could go buy the corporate bonds of some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2039.9s	2039.9	 high quality companies for the 10 or 11%. So you take moderate risk. So you're also competing with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2044.2s	2044.2	 that not to zero risk. Can you explain that for the listeners what that corporate debt is and why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2048.0s	2048.0	 it, you know, pays more? Sure, there are there are, you know, high quality public companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2052.7s	2052.7	 tech companies that have bonds, and that's corporate debt. And they obviously have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2056.6s	2056.6	 pay a higher rate than what the Treasury pays because the Treasury is is risk free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2062.1s	2062.1	 And corporations could default. So there is some risk to it. It's not zero risk. But,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2066.3s	2066.3	 you know, it's like if you're willing to take tech risk, then why wouldn't you buy a bond at 10%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2070.6s	2070.6	 meaning the equity always has to beat that threshold return. But, but hey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2075.4s	2075.4	 can we just go back to the jobs report for a second? I mean, the US government could default,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2079.8s	2079.8	 but it's considered the least likely to default of all issuers of debt in the world. And that's why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2088.2s	2088.2	 Yeah, that's why people call it the risk free rate, because it is the least risky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2091.5s	2091.5	 The US can always repay its debt because the debt is denominated in dollars and the Treasury can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2096.6s	2096.6	 always at the end of the day, print more money that would just be monetizing the debt. Other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2100.4s	2100.4	 countries that owe money and dollars, and obviously don't control the US mint, they can't do that. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2106.5s	2106.5	 they could actually default. But since we're the world's reserve currency, we're never going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2110.1s	2110.1	 default. However, the dollars that you get paid back by the US government might be worth a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2115.5s	2115.5	 less in the future because of inflation. And that's the real risk you have to think about. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2120.0s	2120.0	 there's no default risk, right? Whereas with corporate debt, there is. But let's just go back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2124.4s	2124.4	 to the jobs picture for a second. Jason, you asked about this. So there is news this morning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2130.0s	2130.0	 that we added 261,000 jobs in October. And obviously, given that there's an election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2134.5s	2134.5	 in a few days, then the administration is eager to point to this. But if you dig a little deeper in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2140.0s	2140.0	 the report, I just posted the link there, you see in the raw numbers that there's actually 328,000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2145.9s	2145.9	 fewer employed Americans. And the number of unemployed Americans actually increased 36,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2153.1s	2153.1	 So and the labor force participation rate declined for the third consecutive month to 62.2%. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2160.5s	2160.5	 I don't really understand how all these numbers add up. But the point is the data is very mixed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2165.7s	2165.7	 starting to end it. And there's definitely negativity in there. And this feels to me like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2171.4s	2171.4	 the last gasp of the bull market where there's this residual job creation. But you look at just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2178.3s	2178.3	 what's happened in the last week, where it's stripe cutting. I mean, stripes probably the single
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2183.4s	2183.4	 highest quality, I think it's probably the most valuable private company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2186.6s	2186.6	 It is. Yeah, SpaceX. No, SpaceX is. Oh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2189.0s	2189.0	 Well, SpaceX, okay. But like software, pure software company, they had a 14% cut. You're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2193.6s	2193.6	 starting to see now the rifts really start to pile up. So I think we're at the beginning now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2199.0s	2199.0	 of a long cycle of the unemployment rate going up. I mean, it just feels like the economy is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2204.4s	2204.4	 slowing so fast. The markets are, you know, they've been puking now for six months. It just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2211.4s	2211.4	 feels like this is the beginning of a like really serious recession. Yet we had GDP growth, yet we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2216.2s	2216.2	 had job openings. Remember, we had two quarters, we had two quarters of net negative GDP growth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2222.4s	2222.4	 This is when we had the debate about what our recession is. It was true that if you looked at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2227.3s	2227.3	 growth in nominal terms, it appeared to be strong. And then it was net negative once you subtracted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2231.9s	2231.9	 the inflation rate. You know, we said several months ago, my prediction was a double dip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2236.4s	2236.4	 recession where you had this shallow technical recession, then it bounced back in Q3. But now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2241.6s	2241.6	 I think we're headed into the second part of it, which is the real recession, a recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2245.2s	2245.2	 characterized by joblessness. And you're starting to see economists say we're going to go from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2249.2s	2249.2	 3.7% unemployment rate to say 5% or 6% unemployment next year. So I think we're just beginning to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2257.1s	2257.1	 the job cuts start to add up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2260.5s	2260.5	 This is I think this is what Powell meant, which is, you know, he'll take it as far as it takes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2264.8s	2264.8	 and then he can fix it on the back end by reintroducing, you know, quantitative easing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2270.6s	2270.6	 and reintroducing lower interest rates to stimulate demand. But there's one of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2276.8s	2276.8	 odds he gets this right. It seems to me that the Fed has a habit of reacting too slowly, they were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2282.0s	2282.0	 too slow to react to inflation. My guess is that they'll be too slow to react to the recession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2288.3s	2288.3	 So we'll end up with a period of rates being higher than they should too long. And then they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2292.7s	2292.7	 will correct, they'll drop rates, but that could be two years from now. And meanwhile,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2296.9s	2296.9	 we could be in a pretty deep recession. I think you're probably right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2299.0s	2299.0	 There are two charts for you to look at the GDP by quarter. And then after that, the labor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2304.9s	2304.9	 participation rate. So there's your GDP, Q1, Q2 being negative, Q3 bouncing back, we'll see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2310.2s	2310.2	 what happens in Q4. And then there's your Fed force participation rate for labor, as we discussed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2315.6s	2315.6	 The thing with the labor participation rate that we're still not sort of like truly factoring in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2319.6s	2319.6	 is like, you know, we had a million Americans die because of COVID. And, you know, starting in that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2325.1s	2325.1	 Trump presidency, we lost like seven or eight million immigrants. So those 8 million people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2330.2s	2330.2	 have a huge effect on this number. Yeah, right. And it's not properly really factored in because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2335.8s	2335.8	 if you see that at the start of the Trump presidency, it's just it just fell off a cliff,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2339.8s	2339.8	 basically. And you also have people who retired early, that was a big trend. And this all peaked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2345.2s	2345.2	 in 2000 labor participation hitting that like 67 68%, I think is the peak. And just slowly going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2352.0s	2352.0	 down as boomers retire early, because they made so much on their 401ks and homes. And then you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2358.3s	2358.3	 right, Trimoth, we've had negative, we've really cut immigration the last whatever, five, six years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2363.0s	2363.0	 I think there's an element in here that's missing on how much people individually are finding other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2369.1s	2369.1	 ways to earn income that doesn't qualify and show up in the labor force numbers. People
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2375.3s	2375.3	 have set up Etsy stores, Shopify stores have tripled since COVID. People are making more money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2381.5s	2381.5	 on YouTube, on Instagram, on TikTok than ever before. There's a whole new class of work that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2388.3s	2388.3	 revolves around the individual creating their own business creating their own income stream
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2394.7s	2394.7	 that's simply taken off and has taken off. It was it was kind of a trend pre COVID, but it really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2399.8s	2399.8	 took off during COVID. And there's an element of this that's really more about the transition of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2404.6s	2404.6	 how people work and how they earn that isn't reflected in these numbers. I don't think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2409.0s	2409.0	 the idea that everyone should go be an employee at a company is necessarily the right way to think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2413.5s	2413.5	 about labor going forward. The amount of money that individuals are earning is probably the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2418.5s	2418.5	 better way to frame this up going forward and as really thinking about the earning power and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2423.1s	2423.1	 economic health of this country. This is something important you're bringing up here. Gig workers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2428.0s	2428.0	 are about 9% of the workforce. And Uber and Dara had they grew over 70% this year. But I think the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2436.5s	2436.5	 big number that I watched for was drivers are making $36 an hour in the United States working
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2441.8s	2441.8	 for Uber. So you're exactly right. People are finding other options, whether it's door dash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2445.3s	2445.3	 Uber. And that doesn't qualify in labor force, right? Because they're independent contractors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2451.4s	2451.4	 are counted. Yeah, they are counted. That's based on my preliminary research. If somebody wants to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2456.3s	2456.3	 fact check us, that'd be great. But my understanding is independent contractors, which is what gig
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2460.9s	2460.9	 workers are classified under are counted in labor participation. I don't know how they're counted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2466.2s	2466.2	 We'll look that up and figure that out. There was a story in BBC that the Bank of England has now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2473.6s	2473.6	 warned that the UK is facing its longest recession since records began. Some of this is getting to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2479.8s	2479.8	 fear porn. Yeah. But look, here's what I think is scary about going into recession is number one,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2485.7s	2485.7	 you don't really know how long it's going to take to get out. We know the average recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2489.0s	2489.0	 lasts about 18 months. But the truth is once it starts, you just don't know. And the second thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2493.1s	2493.1	 is you don't really know who's been stress tested. People claim that they can weather the storm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2498.2s	2498.2	 but the truth is that there's no way to simulate, truly simulate a stress test. They claim they can,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2504.6s	2504.6	 but the only way is to really subject an institution to that pressure and that stress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2509.9s	2509.9	 And then you see if they come out the other side. So that's the issue is you just going into this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2515.7s	2515.7	 there's a lot of unknown unknowns. And this is why I would just urge founders to be cautious is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2522.1s	2522.1	 because if the recession ends up being shallow and shorter than people expect, great, you'll be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2528.0s	2528.0	 surprised to the upside. But if the recession ends up being deeper and longer than expected,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2533.4s	2533.4	 you don't want to go out of business. You want to be protected against that. So again, we've been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2537.4s	2537.4	 saying this since February and May, but again, I just reiterate, I think it really makes sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2542.1s	2542.1	 for founders to be conservative, prioritize your survival above all else. This recession probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2549.6s	2549.6	 will last about two years. You want to make sure you survive it. And to Chimass point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2554.0s	2554.0	 if you survive it with lower growth, that's fine. You can keep growing on the other end of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2557.6s	2557.6	 thing. But if you go out of business, because you grew too fast, then you're not going to get the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2562.1s	2562.1	 chance to fix that problem when the recession is over. I just don't see anybody rewarding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2567.9s	2567.9	 hyper growth that is burning a ton of cash where you have to be back in market every year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2573.6s	2573.6	 Because it's it's just very hard to feel comfortable that the conditions on the field
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2579.4s	2579.4	 aren't going to be drastically different a year from now, right? It's not like we know that it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2583.8s	2583.8	 going to be better or worse. And I think that that uncertainty is actually really bad for companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2590.2s	2590.2	 So to your point is just like a lot of folks have tried to shy away David from actually revisiting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2596.5s	2596.5	 their valuations, they've done these complicated converts, and they've they've tried to basically,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2601.4s	2601.4	 you know, it's I think it's sort of like managing their ego or the board's ego. And I think like the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2608.4s	2608.4	 next shoe to drop has to be these founders and these boards just saying, Okay, let's just take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2614.0s	2614.0	 the hard medicine. What's the real, you know, market clearing price and valuation, let's get a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2617.9s	2617.9	 third party to price it. And let's get new fresh equity and then move forward. Because if you don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2622.7s	2622.7	 do that, and you wait until everybody's trying to do it, then it's going to be a really tough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2627.7s	2627.7	 scenario. So better to your point, you know, this is why like stripe, it's so smart, better to cut
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2633.4s	2633.4	 now. Again, it's always hard to let people go. But it's better to do that now than 18 months from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2640.1s	2640.1	 now. Because you just have no idea how much more expensive or hard it's going to be then.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2646.1s	2646.1	 And who's going to even be in the business of lending money or investing money in 18 months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2650.8s	2650.8	 And you know, that that sounds pretty crazy. But it's like, I think that that's that's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2654.5s	2654.5	 moment that we're in to your point, Friedberg, I did a little research here. And according to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2660.3s	2660.3	 the Fed of St. Louis, if you counted casual workers, informal workers, over doing over 20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2670.3s	2670.3	 hours a week of informal work, aka gig work, you would increase labor participation between a half
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2675.9s	2675.9	 point and a point if you counted all of them, maybe even slightly more than two percentage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2680.6s	2680.6	 points higher. So probably about a point seems like a realistic way to look at labor participation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2686.0s	2686.0	 And of the eight points, or maybe now the six or seven points to 10%, it would then account for 10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2692.9s	2692.9	 to 20% of the 10% drop in labor participation. It's just alarming statistics. Because if most people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2699.7s	2699.7	 have most of their personal net worth tied up in their home asset, and their home values are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2706.1s	2706.1	 declining or going to decline. And we're seeing this dramatic spike in consumer credit in the US,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2713.4s	2713.4	 it paints a really ugly picture for the next two years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2716.0s	2716.0	 Wow, guys, I'm just looking at I'm just looking at the markets today, get labs down 15% snowflakes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2721.4s	2721.4	 down 13%. Monday's down 14%. At last, down 30%. In one day, a Yelp is down 17%. These are open door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2732.4s	2732.4	 is down 16%. So it's just a horrible Oh my gosh, the cloud computing index, WCLD has hit a new low
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2740.2s	2740.2	 for the year is down to 23 bucks. I think the previous low was 25 is down almost 8% today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2746.5s	2746.5	 And this is on a day in which the NASDAQ is down less than 1%. So the point is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2750.9s	2750.9	 are rotating out of growth stocks. Yeah, it's just brutal. And so listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2756.0s	2756.0	 if you're a startup founder, you got to realize these are like some of the highest quality public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2759.9s	2759.9	 studios down 40% today. Trillio is down 37% in a day today. Whoa. But guys, this is this is just math,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2769.7s	2769.7	 you know, it's not a judgment on any of these companies. It's just pure math. This is why I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2774.5s	2774.5	 think you have to be utterly unemotional in this moment. And if you're if you're a CEO, running a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2780.2s	2780.2	 company, particularly a SaaS business, you have to really figure out how to how to right size your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2787.3s	2787.3	 cost basis and make this money last profitable industrial companies are up. Bill Gurley had a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2792.2s	2792.2	 tweet a tweet about this a few months ago about how the biggest mistake people make in riffs is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2797.3s	2797.3	 they just do like a tepid riff like a 10% ish riff, and they have to come back and they do it again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2802.2s	2802.2	 and they do it again. This is what I think the the Elon action this week really sets a standard he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2807.5s	2807.5	 shows the entirety of Silicon Valley, that you can cut deep and you can turn a profit and you can do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2812.6s	2812.6	 it fast. And it could set a new standard for how folks are managing this. Jack Welch used to in his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2817.8s	2817.8	 management principles recommend dropping the bottom 10% of people every year. And so you know, the 10 13%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2824.4s	2824.4	 cuts don't really pass muster as a public market investor kind of looks at the the management across
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2830.2s	2830.2	 these different companies to turn a profit. They're going to say the folks that are making the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2833.4s	2833.4	 deepest cuts the fastest are the ones that are going to get valued. It's unfortunate and it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2837.4s	2837.4	 difficult circumstance for everyone in Silicon Valley to deal with from the employees to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2842.1s	2842.1	 investors to the public and private shareholders. It's really brutal. One quick question for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2846.5s	2846.5	 guys. It's really just this kind of market motivation that's underway right now. Here's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2850.2s	2850.2	 the chart. And my question for you is when do Google and Facebook stop this? I mean, if you look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2856.3s	2856.3	 at the number of employees being added, it is truly extraordinary. Here's the chart and this includes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2861.4s	2861.4	 the latest quarter. So they are not turning off hiring yet. What do you think? Hold on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2870.1s	2870.1	 didn't they announce a hiring freeze? They announced that they were at Google, they announced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2875.2s	2875.2	 that they were going to hold people accountable to better performance and they were going to go do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2879.0s	2879.0	 more with less and then they added more people. Facebook said they would do a hiring freeze.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2883.5s	2883.5	 3% today. Yeah, I would do a hiring freeze. Well, what they had a job last quarter. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2891.4s	2891.4	 Well, you're right. They just announced a hiring freeze. You look at Apple,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2894.6s	2894.6	 Apple just announced in non R&D functions, a hiring freeze. This is Apple like the most valuable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2900.6s	2900.6	 profitable company in the world. So if Apple basically is putting the brakes on non-engineering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2906.2s	2906.2	 hiring, that tells you something about how fast the economy is slowing down. I think that was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2910.3s	2910.3	 huge signal. Yeah. The point Freeber makes is so correct, which is if you're doing a riff,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2916.3s	2916.3	 obviously there's a reason why, but I think we're seeing too many riffs where the details of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2922.4s	2922.4	 riff and the magnitude of the riff don't match up with what the objective of the riff is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2926.7s	2926.7	 The objective of the riff for a lot of these companies should be to get them cash flow positive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2932.5s	2932.5	 or at least to put them on a runway or trajectory where they can get cash flow positive with their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2938.6s	2938.6	 existing cash on the balance sheet, right? They won't need to raise money again. And we're seeing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2943.6s	2943.6	 a lot of companies where they don't achieve that and they have to come back again and again and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2948.5s	2948.5	 hit it again. And that creates more turmoil for the company and it's more unfair for the employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2954.4s	2954.4	 By the way, to that point, I'll just say how deep these companies are cutting and how quickly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2959.4s	2959.4	 management is expressing to their shareholders, how they're going to turn a profit becomes a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2964.7s	2964.7	 signal for those shareholders on whether or not they want to stay in that stock. And the companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2968.8s	2968.8	 that are doing it fast and are doing it deep, the investors and the shareholders say you do actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2973.4s	2973.4	 have a path that makes sense here. I'm going to stay in the stock. Cash today versus cash in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2977.0s	2977.0	 future. Let me ask you a question in terms of strategy for one of these companies, let's say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2981.8s	2981.8	 the Facebook Corporation or perhaps even Google, or Apple even if they were to cut their expenses,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2989.8s	2989.8	 which might take obviously a riff. And then because their stock prices are so depressed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=2994.8s	2994.8	 right now, maybe even a mid cap one like a Twilio or an Uber or an Airbnb, if they were cut costs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3000.8s	3000.8	 and then start buying back their shares, which some companies have been doing, what would that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3005.0s	3005.0	 do in terms of the markets appreciation of those stocks or management teams? I think it's hard to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3009.3s	3009.3	 tell. I think that the if you have not lost investor trust, I think it would be really well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3017.2s	3017.2	 rewarded. If you have become unreliable and undisciplined, even those cuts, I think would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3027.4s	3027.4	 be met with some amount of excitement, but but probably not a broad base support. So, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3034.6s	3034.6	 then it just goes to narrative meaning, if Google did it, I think that people really trust Sundar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3040.8s	3040.8	 and Ruth. And I think the stock would go bonkers, they would they would probably move very quickly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3047.0s	3047.0	 into the echelon of Apple and Apple is sort of a first among equals like they're just they're just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3053.8s	3053.8	 in a different class unto themselves. Facebook, I think is a little bit harder because I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3059.0s	3059.0	 folks have gotten burned and you know, they would have to make some really, really deep cuts, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3063.8s	3063.8	 then, you know, where do you do it, you can't capitulate on this meta strategy. But then the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3069.1s	3069.1	 other part is where you make all the money. And so you have this huge morale issue that you have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3074.2s	3074.2	 manage. So it's just a really hard game to play. Just one more thought on on on the riff stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3080.6s	3080.6	 I think one thought experiment for founders is to think about what was your plan at the end of 2019.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3087.4s	3087.4	 Why do I say that because 2020 and 2021 were two of the most distorted years ever in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3093.2s	3093.2	 history of financial markets and the economy because we had COVID. And then we had the reaction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3097.9s	3097.9	 to COVID. Right. And so you saw there was this, you know, Zoom's market cap hit 100 billion, all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3103.5s	3103.5	 the e commerce companies were doing extremely well. You know, you had all this money printing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3108.2s	3108.2	 you know, you had zero interest rates and so on. You had SaaS companies hitting all time highs at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3113.1s	3113.1	 the end of 2021. So we lived through this incredibly distorted time. So as a thought experiment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3118.8s	3118.8	 go look at what your plan for 2020 was supposed to be when you created it at the end of 2019.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3125.1s	3125.1	 Because that was the last time that you were thinking without any distortions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3129.6s	3129.6	 you know, that were then created. And I think if you were to go back and look at your 2020 plan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3135.2s	3135.2	 again, created at the end of 2019, you'd probably see that you could get by with half the headcount
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3140.8s	3140.8	 you have now, because probably you doubled your head count during the last two years during these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3145.2s	3145.2	 heady heady times. And yet I think founders start thinking, oh, I can't go back to operating, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3150.4s	3150.4	 know, I can't operate at half the level of headcount. But you were you were operating with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3154.6s	3154.6	 half the level of headcount, by definition, at some earlier point. I also think sometimes I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3159.8s	3159.8	 what founders say is what will people think if I cut 50%? Meaning all of a sudden, the perceived
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3166.1s	3166.1	 success of my business would be different. And I think that this is where you have to realize,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3170.8s	3170.8	 no, like, there's a lot of ego tied up in these things, which slows people down from doing the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3175.6s	3175.6	 thing that they need to do. It's a really, it's a really hard to do. I mean, look at Airbnb as an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3181.8s	3181.8	 example. I mean, they did this ginormous riff during COVID, because they had no choice. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3187.5s	3187.5	 their revenue went essentially to zero. And now the business is incredibly strong. It's throwing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3193.1s	3193.1	 off massive amounts of free cash flow. And the stock market seems to really love what Airbnb has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3197.5s	3197.5	 done. And a similar story over at Uber in terms of having done significant rifts and probably could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3203.7s	3203.7	 do significant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3204.4s	3204.4	 Yeah, but J.K. let's just be clear, Airbnb is still down almost 75% off its high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3209.6s	3209.6	 Right. So when you say the stock market love it, so they're up today 3%. So meaning they're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3214.1s	3214.1	 down 30% in one day, but they have gone down with the rest of the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3218.6s	3218.6	 They have gone down with the rest of the market. But it feels like the business I'm talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3222.8s	3222.8	 the business fundamentals when you're throwing off almost a billion dollars of free cash flow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3226.4s	3226.4	 Yeah, now you're going to start people are going to perceive that business maybe as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3229.8s	3229.8	 of this cohort, the flight to safety, right? Or same thing with Uber throwing off free cash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3234.2s	3234.2	 flow. Now, I think a lot of these names are going to I don't own Airbnb right now, but I do on Uber.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3238.7s	3238.7	 I think the people throwing off the free cash flow are going to look pretty attractive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3242.2s	3242.2	 and be able to buy their stock back maybe. All right, everybody, let's talk about the midterms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3249.0s	3249.0	 A lot of big Senate races and obviously governors, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3254.8s	3254.8	 Wisconsin, Ohio, all really important races. Sax, what do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3260.5s	3260.5	 Well, it looks to me like there's going to be a Republican wave. There was an interesting article
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3264.8s	3264.8	 actually on CNN where they it's called five scary numbers for Democrats. And what they point to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3271.0s	3271.0	 is that Biden right now has a 42% approval rating. 61% of the American people say he hasn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3279.4s	3279.4	 focused on the key problems. So this is called the out of touch index. 51% say the economy's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3284.6s	3284.6	 no one issue compared to only 15% for abortion. And then 78% say we're on the wrong track. I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3289.4s	3289.4	 think I've seen a right track, wrong track index that was so negative. And 75% of the country says
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3295.8s	3295.8	 we're in a recession. So, you know, when you look at polling numbers like that, it must translate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3301.4s	3301.4	 I think, into a Republican wave. And you have now real clear politics currently has the GOP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3307.5s	3307.5	 gaining four Senate seats. So winning in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, and New Hampshire, that's a big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3312.8s	3312.8	 change from just a couple weeks ago, and winning 31 House seats. So this is this is kind of what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3319.0s	3319.0	 it's looking like right now. But look, the margin is still within the within the margin of error on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3325.2s	3325.2	 the polling. So Nate Silver has pointed out that within one standard deviation, you could either
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3331.0s	3331.0	 have a Republican wave or you could have basically the Republicans fizzle out. So it's going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3336.7s	3336.7	 very close. But ultimately, I think this breaks Republican. Yeah, the to me, the way that I've,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3343.8s	3343.8	 I'm looking at it right now is that it seems like most scenarios, the Republicans will have the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3349.6s	3349.6	 majority in the house. And the real question is what happens in the Senate, it's really,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3354.6s	3354.6	 really kind of a coin flip. And that's going to be really interesting to see. So, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3360.4s	3360.4	 things where I thought would break Republican in the Senate, like Pennsylvania are now back to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3365.4s	3365.4	 almost the you know, a statistical dead heat. So it's a really interesting moment, actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3371.1s	3371.1	 It's, but most scenarios, David, I think you'd agree, is that the Republicans win the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3377.3s	3377.3	 And then there's a non there's a plurality of scenarios where they also win the Senate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3381.0s	3381.0	 the house will almost certainly go Republican. But I think the Senate now the official percentage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3385.6s	3385.6	 are 55% likely to tip Republican. But I, I just think that in a wave year like this, where the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3391.9s	3391.9	 wrong track sentiment is so high, I think all these races that are a dead heat, they're more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3397.6s	3397.6	 likely to break in one direction as opposed to like a random distribution, which is why I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3402.3s	3402.3	 you could just as easily end up with, you know, instead of it being a 5149 Senate, it could be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3409.5s	3409.5	 5545. Because all these things could break the same way. So right now, so I would slightly disagree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3415.8s	3415.8	 in Pennsylvania, I think Oz has improved as a candidate. Fetterman did that debate. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3420.6s	3420.6	 since he suffered that stroke, he kind of came across as somebody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3423.7s	3423.7	 How do we feel about that? That I had very, very hard to watch that happen. And yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3429.8s	3429.8	 I mean, the guy, the guy has suffered a stroke and it's sad, but he, you know, he doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3433.8s	3433.8	 present as someone who can be a senator right now. I think Oz, what does the science say about that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3438.9s	3438.9	 Like a re as a society? Is this a good idea to have somebody post stroke be in office? I'm not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3443.7s	3443.7	 picking any political side here. I'm just talking about the medical issue. Oz is actually doing the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3447.5s	3447.5	 right thing right now, which is he's not actually focusing on that issue because it's so obvious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3451.7s	3451.7	 He doesn't want to be seen as beating up on Fetterman. And instead, he's focusing on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3457.1s	3457.1	 issues. And actually, a Fetterman's issues are very unpopular in a state like Pennsylvania.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3462.8s	3462.8	 So I actually think for both reasons, Oz is going to win that. I think Fetterman's manifestly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3467.6s	3467.6	 unqualified, but also I think his positions are fairly unpopular. So I think Pennsylvania will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3473.2s	3473.2	 almost certainly tip. So let me pull up the chart here just so people can see. Ohio is going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3477.0s	3477.0	 Republican. And then Arizona, I think is really the interesting one where Blake Masters is now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3482.6s	3482.6	 tied after being behind Mark Kelly throughout this campaign. He is now tied in Newport.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3489.0s	3489.0	 He's tied now? Oh, God. He's so unpopular. Your guy is really unpopular. And now he's tied?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3493.4s	3493.4	 It's the Peter Thiel. He was never that unpopular, J Cal. That was your interpretation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3497.3s	3497.3	 It's the Peter Thiel wave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3498.5s	3498.5	 He was doing really poorly, I think, because he was anti-choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3501.6s	3501.6	 I think, listen, I think that Arizona is probably going to be the closest race in the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3506.2s	3506.2	 I think it's going to be a nail biter, but I think Blake's going to pull that out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3508.7s	3508.7	 Sacks, what do you think are the biggest policy shifts that take place in this country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3515.3s	3515.3	 post this predicted red wave? Is there anything that changes? So just, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3520.4s	3520.4	 talk to folks about what's on the docket from a legislative point of view going into the next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3526.2s	3526.2	 Congress with all these new candidates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3528.8s	3528.8	 The reality is we have a separation of powers in this country, and you're going to have divided
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3533.1s	3533.1	 government. The Republicans will control Congress. The Democrats will control the presidency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3538.2s	3538.2	 And so as a result, you're going to be largely in a gridlock situation. But gridlock may be a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3543.2s	3543.2	 better than what we've had over the last couple of years. So, you know, you've had basically this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3547.5s	3547.5	 orgy of spending and money printing, and I think that's going to stop, obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3552.2s	3552.2	 The other thing that's going to happen is Republicans may not be able to pass much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3555.3s	3555.3	 legislation, but they're going to be able to do investigations. And there's a lot of questions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3558.6s	3558.6	 that need to be answered, I think, about still about COVID, you know, these lockdown policies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3563.3s	3563.3	 that we had that started at the top at NIH, why did they happen? We need to start having accountability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3568.6s	3568.6	 for some of these horrible decisions that were made during COVID. And there's been no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3572.2s	3572.2	 willingness in Washington to hold anyone accountable. At a minimum, they need to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3575.8s	3575.8	 some congressional investigations and find out why we pursued such bad policies over the last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3580.6s	3580.6	 couple of years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3581.4s	3581.4	 By the way, did you see what happened this week where the CDC, you know, after this entire opioid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3587.9s	3587.9	 epidemic and all of these lawsuits, the CDC came out and actually said, Hey, listen, we need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3593.3s	3593.3	 really make sure that we're getting access, putting opioids in the hands of Americans who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3599.3s	3599.3	 are really suffering with pain management and whatnot. And I didn't read the article to really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3604.3s	3604.3	 understand the details, but I just thought it was an incredible headline where it's like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3607.9s	3607.9	 it's just sad, it's so counter to the narrative of what we've been told is happening, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3611.6s	3611.6	 like, you know, over prescription and misprescription.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3614.2s	3614.2	 If we learned anything during COVID is to question every organization, everybody and to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3619.5s	3619.5	 really collect your own information, while you know, looking at these organizations, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3625.0s	3625.0	 trusted over time, I know I look at the world differently now that you couldn't say COVID was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3630.1s	3630.1	 possibly a lab leak without having your podcast taken down or being banned on YouTube. And now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3635.7s	3635.7	 ProPublica has done an investigation and they're saying along with Vanity Fair, and they're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3639.5s	3639.5	 to win a Pulitzer for this, I bet that this conspiracy theory from two years ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3644.2s	3644.2	 is probably actually the leading theory and that the Wuhan lab lab was showing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3651.1s	3651.1	 if you didn't see it, reporting an incident in late November of last year, before COVID broke 2019.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3657.9s	3657.9	 It's really, it's really incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3659.4s	3659.4	 There was an article in the Atlantic that came out over the past week called Let's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3663.8s	3663.8	 Declare a Pandemic Amnesty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3666.0s	3666.0	 No, let's do a pandemic investigation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3669.4s	3669.4	 Right. So basically, yes, all the experts who told us, Jason, that we weren't allowed to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3674.7s	3674.7	 an opinion because we weren't expert enough, that if we raise any questions about the origin of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3679.5s	3679.5	 virus, that it might've come from a lab, that that basically needs to be censored. The people who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3683.6s	3683.6	 said we had to do lockdowns and implemented all these authoritarian tactics. Now they're saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3688.5s	3688.5	 that they need an amnesty. What that really means, no one's looking to criminally prosecute them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3694.1s	3694.1	 What we're looking to do is have some accountability around the public policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3697.4s	3697.4	 What they want is they want to pull the expert card to say that they're the only ones who get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3701.8s	3701.8	 to have an opinion and make a decision. But then when it all goes horribly awry, they basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3706.2s	3706.2	 want to be completely insulated and unaccountable from their decisions. No way, no way. We're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3710.9s	3710.9	 going to give you full investigation. We're in alignment on this, Sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3714.2s	3714.2	 By the way, can I just tell you why that's it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3715.4s	3715.4	 Hold on. I just want to say, Sacks, we're in alignment on this for a rare moment of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3719.0s	3719.0	 peace on this podcast. The same thing after 9-11. Shouldn't all Americans understand what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3724.1s	3724.1	 happened after 9-11 and what the failures were in our intelligence just so we can get better?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3729.4s	3729.4	 I'm not picking a political horse here, but it's kind of crazy that you could,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3733.7s	3733.7	 people said to our podcast and other people who were questioning it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3737.2s	3737.2	 forget about what political party you're in. Just want to understand how the world works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3741.2s	3741.2	 What are the chances that this breaks out in the one or two places where they're studying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3745.5s	3745.5	 the coronavirus that you have a lab leak? It was so obvious to everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3749.3s	3749.3	 The other reason why you need to have accountability for this is that there is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3752.5s	3752.5	 still a long tail, especially around the damage that we did to our kids educationally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3758.6s	3758.6	 And now the over prescription of stimulants. And so if you don't have answers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3762.6s	3762.6	 you can't go after these problems. Like there is a, there is like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3768.6s	3768.6	 stimulant prescription is now the single biggest epidemic in children. It is now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3773.9s	3773.9	 twice as prescribed as contraceptives and asthma drugs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3778.0s	3778.0	 And why, Chamath, why are we doing this? To get them to score higher on a test,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3781.6s	3781.6	 to be more attentive in school? Well, it's, it's actually this negative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3784.6s	3784.6	 feedback loop where these children were miseducated during COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3792.2s	3792.2	 It had huge psychological and academic damage to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3798.0s	3798.0	 Our test scores have fallen off of a cliff relative to how we used to do relative to other countries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3804.5s	3804.5	 I think the teachers unions have found a way to try to explain it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3808.0s	3808.0	 to basically shield themselves from any sort of critique.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3812.6s	3812.6	 And so the loop, and then part of that loop is then to look at a bunch of kids that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3816.6s	3816.6	 underperforming in school. And instead of saying, well, maybe these lockdowns and masking and all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3822.2s	3822.2	 of these things that we implemented actually had a huge impact. They say, you know, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3826.6s	3826.6	 misbehaving, so let's put you on a stimulant. Yeah, it's crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3830.1s	3830.1	 We're in that loop right now, just so you guys know, the data is outrageous. Twice as many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3835.3s	3835.3	 prescriptions for stimulants as the sum of contraceptives and asthma drugs for all American
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3841.6s	3841.6	 kids. Yeah, it's not that suddenly everybody's got ADHD. It's we failed them. We failed our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3847.3s	3847.3	 children, and we're going to use stimulants to have them catch up. We should be doing summer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3851.9s	3851.9	 schools, after school programs, weekends, whatever. We failed them because of our response to COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3857.5s	3857.5	 That is why we need answers to all that stuff, because you need to link these things together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3861.2s	3861.2	 to have some real accountability. Absolutely. Here's the question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3864.6s	3864.6	 Absolutely. Here is the just so we have the people see the numbers. Here's the 538 poll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3869.2s	3869.2	 of how Joe Biden's popularity has switched. This is 654 days into his presidency started out really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3877.6s	3877.6	 strong 54%. And now a little rebound since the summer. Obviously, that dip started with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3885.4s	3885.4	 economy. It's the economy, stupid. And if we go down a little bit on the same page, and you zoom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3890.0s	3890.0	 in on the left there, you can see compared to Donald Trump, he started out much more popular
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3894.0s	3894.0	 than Donald Trump day by day. And now he's just as unpopular as Donald Trump was at this point in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3898.6s	3898.6	 his presidency. Well, look, I mean, look, the setup is really interesting for 2024. Because it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3903.0s	3903.0	 probably going to be the case that we're in the middle of a recession going into that election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3907.0s	3907.0	 cycle. Maybe we'll be sort of like getting ourselves out of it. But there'll be a lot of economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3912.1s	3912.1	 damage, high unemployment. And, you know, typically, folks in power will have to sort of be held
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3918.7s	3918.7	 accountable for that. It's a really interesting setup that both Gavin Newsom and Ron DeSantis have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3924.9s	3924.9	 to figure out now and navigate if they're going to get the nomination on each side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3928.1s	3928.1	 Aaron Norris And breaking news today,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3930.4s	3930.4	 Sachs would love to get your thoughts on this. Axio says, and we'll go to Science Corner next,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3935.4s	3935.4	 that Trump's going to announce on November 14, that he is running for president.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3940.6s	3940.6	 Pete Slauson Look, I kind of have the Joe Rogan philosophy on this, which is why give it oxygen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3944.7s	3944.7	 Let's just wait and see. There's certainly no need to talk about it before it happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3948.8s	3948.8	 You know, we're not even past this election yet. But hey, I want to go back to the Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3953.6s	3953.6	 popularity because I think part of the issue here is what are the arguments that Biden is making to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3959.2s	3959.2	 the country about why people should vote Democratic? And he gave another speech on Wednesday night
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3966.2s	3966.2	 where he basically claimed that if you vote for a different party, that that is a threat to democracy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3972.6s	3972.6	 In other words, the perpetuation of single party rule is what you must do if you care about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3977.8s	3977.8	 democracy. That is a sales pitch that's not going to appeal to anybody outside of the viewers of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3982.6s	3982.6	 MSNBC. It's just not. He's not talking about the issues that really matter to the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3987.2s	3987.2	 You know, what the country wants to know is that he's focused on the economy, he's focused on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3991.1s	3991.1	 inflation, he's focused on crime, he's focused on the schools and fixing this learning loss that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=3997.0s	3997.0	 Jamoth was just talking about. He's not doing those things. Instead, he's basically saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4001.3s	4001.3	 that the Democrats should be kept in power forever because there was a riot at the Capitol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4005.6s	4005.6	 on January 6. And look, that was a stain on the country. Okay, it was terrible that that happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4010.4s	4010.4	 Disgusting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4010.8s	4010.8	 That is not a reason. Hold on a second. That is not a reason to keep Democrats in power forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4015.4s	4015.4	 And actually, there's a liberal guy, a liberal Democrat named Josh Barrow,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4020.1s	4020.1	 who wrote a pretty good blog about this. And what he said is the message is that there's only one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4025.5s	4025.5	 party contesting this election that is committed to democracy, the Democrats, and therefore only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4030.5s	4030.5	 one real choice available. If voters reject Democrats' agenda or their record on issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4035.5s	4035.5	 including inflation, crime, and immigration, they have no recourse to the ballot box. They simply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4039.5s	4039.5	 must vote for Democrats anyway. And that argument is just not flying. And actually, he's a Democrat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4045.6s	4045.6	 who is pointing this out. But I don't think that Democrats are getting the message on this, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4051.0s	4051.0	 I think they will after this election. And they're going to have to find a new sales pitch to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4054.9s	4054.9	 country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4055.4s	4055.4	 Well, you know, and he does have a good sales pitch, doesn't he, Chamath, with these major
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4059.4s	4059.4	 bipartisan wins, he had the infrastructure deal got done, the technology bill and the chips,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4064.7s	4064.7	 you got gas prices going down, you got GDP growth, you got job growth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4069.0s	4069.0	 The problem is that those things happened, frankly, too early in his presidency, and things are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4073.7s	4073.7	 getting materially worse. So I just sent you a link. Can you just throw this up here? For a second,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4078.0s	4078.0	 you know, Jason, you mentioned this cheaper gas thing. Yeah, but the reality is, if you look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4083.4s	4083.4	 this, we have now depleted our strategic oil reserve by almost 50%. Yeah. So we are running out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4089.8s	4089.8	 of oil that we can introduce into the market at effectively zero cost to bring the price down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4096.4s	4096.4	 And because we've lost our relationships with folks like Saudi Arabia, there's no way to influence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4101.7s	4101.7	 them in order to produce more. In fact, they're going to cut supply so that they can control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4107.8s	4107.8	 the prices that they have, which that they can sell into the market. And so now what are we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4112.9s	4112.9	 left with? Well, the only three places where you can have incremental supply of energy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4117.4s	4117.4	 which the country still needs is from Russia, Iran and Venezuela. And so, you know, all of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4124.9s	4124.9	 things, Jason, I think come back and really put Biden in a tough place. Because as as SAC says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4130.1s	4130.1	 he does have to answer to all of these things, because these are his decisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4134.6s	4134.6	 But I still believe in the Democrats, you know, I I'm hoping I gave a million bucks to the Senate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4140.7s	4140.7	 PAC trying to sort of tip the Senate, I really think it's important that we have a split
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4145.3s	4145.3	 government because I've kind of I gave up on the house, I think it's clear that the Republicans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4148.7s	4148.7	 are going to win, but the Senate is still is still up for grabs. And the reason is because I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4154.3s	4154.3	 that we need to sort of have stasis, so that nothing bad happens between now and 2024. Because I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4160.6s	4160.6	 think the economic conditions on the ground are going to be bad in and of themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4165.9s	4165.9	 Free Berkeley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4167.0s	4167.0	 And then just the one last thing I'll say is, the instructive thing that I think we should look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4172.2s	4172.2	 is what happened in Germany. Because what happened in Germany is really interesting. When the economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4177.1s	4177.1	 turns, and inflation is out of control, and energy is out of control. What they basically did was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4182.9s	4182.9	 they sidelined the European Central Bank, they stepped in with their own balance sheet and said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4189.0s	4189.0	 you know what, we're going to nationalize assets. And I know that this sounds crazy to say, but if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4194.3s	4194.3	 it can happen in a place like Germany, I know most people would say it'll never happen in America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4199.2s	4199.2	 But I'm not so sure. And I think that you want to make sure that there's a split government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4204.6s	4204.6	 so that these things are never possible. And so hopefully there's some, you know, common ground
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4210.5s	4210.5	 in a Democratic Senate and a Republican House. And we just kind of get through 24 and see where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4215.7s	4215.7	 the chips land. And I still think it's going to be DeSantis versus Newsom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4220.5s	4220.5	 Freeberg, any final thoughts here on politics?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4223.3s	4223.3	 My first observation is that I think it's funny that Chamath and Sachs are funding opposite sides
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4229.0s	4229.0	 of the electrocyclic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4231.4s	4231.4	 Yeah, why don't you just guys just give the money to me and Freeberg to get a plane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4234.5s	4234.5	 Bring each other's money up. I could think of other ways for you guys to use that money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4238.6s	4238.6	 But David and I may have canceled each other out. You're right. I mean, so far,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4242.1s	4242.1	 Peter Thiel made the better trade. It looks like the Thiel wave in the Senate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4245.4s	4245.4	 So look, I would say my very broad statement is democracies evolve in a cyclical nature over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4254.0s	4254.0	 You often see swings from one political party to the other. And it's just the nature that once
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4260.4s	4260.4	 someone's been in office, they form the new establishment. And then folks on the next election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4265.7s	4265.7	 cycle want to vote against that establishment because there are things that they want that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4269.5s	4269.5	 aren't being given today. And therefore the democracy forces a change from what is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4274.0s	4274.0	 current establishment back to the other side. And generally political parties seem to kind of adopt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4278.8s	4278.8	 whatever the other side is. And that's how the cyclical evolution of democracy seems to play out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4283.9s	4283.9	 The recent trend that has been more alarming, which I think we can kind of take pause to notice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4288.9s	4288.9	 is the rise of populism, where populism is this really kind of vehement diehard opposition to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4295.2s	4295.2	 elitism and the establishments that everyone feels kept down by and everyone feels taken advantage of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4300.6s	4300.6	 by. And the rise of Trump, the rise of Bolsonaro, the rise of Boris Johnson, and I would argue even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4308.1s	4308.1	 the rise of AOC, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren all similarly speak to the crying voice of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4317.0s	4317.0	 the democratic populations that they want to see these establishments taken apart. They don't feel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4326.1s	4326.1	 like they're fair. They don't feel like they're just. They don't feel like the institutions that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4330.5s	4330.5	 oversee us and are meant to service us are servicing us. And so there was this big rise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4335.9s	4335.9	 The problem is like a normal pendulum would swing back and forth between one side and the other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4340.4s	4340.4	 With the rise of populism, you get such a strong push of that pendulum. It can knock through a wall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4345.4s	4345.4	 And I think we saw that on January 6th. And I think it gave a lot of people pause. We saw the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4350.8s	4350.8	 motion of Brexit knocking through a wall. And we saw these kind of very radical outcomes. And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4358.1s	4358.1	 the cost of those outcomes blow up in our face. And as a result, I think we're seeing a bit of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4364.5s	4364.5	 receding of the tides right now away from populism during this current electoral cycle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4370.1s	4370.1	 where folks are saying, you know what, maybe we just need to have some sort of an establishment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4373.8s	4373.8	 so I can feel safe and secure less than the volatility that I've experienced of late.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4378.6s	4378.6	 Look, I think you look at the economic mess we're in. Populist did not cause that. Populist did not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4384.2s	4384.2	 cause $10 trillion of money printing. It was modern monetary theory and the experts, the Fed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4389.0s	4389.0	 who did that. It wasn't populists who created the great financial crisis of 2008 that caused
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4394.1s	4394.1	 the ZERP. And we're still living with all the downstream effects of that. It was the experts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4398.9s	4398.9	 on Wall Street who said they could manage all these derivatives and the collateralized mortgage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4403.7s	4403.7	 obligations and all that stuff that they lost control over. And hold on, and on COVID, it wasn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4409.3s	4409.3	 populist. The CDC are the experts. Yeah, the CDC are the experts that caused it. And on COVID,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4413.4s	4413.4	 it was not populists who caused the horrible handling of that pandemic, even though they were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4418.5s	4418.5	 blamed for it. Remember, we were told it was a pandemic of the unvaccinated, then it turns out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4422.7s	4422.7	 the vaccine doesn't stop it. It was not populists who caused the reaction to the pandemic. It was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4427.5s	4427.5	 the experts, the CDC and Fauci and people like that who shut down our economy, who caused the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4433.1s	4433.1	 learning loss. It was those experts. So, Freeburg, listen, you may not like this populist waiver that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4438.3s	4438.3	 we have in the country, and I get that, but it's in reaction to something real, which is the failure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4443.3s	4443.3	 of this expert class. And if you want to stop having this populist wave rise up, we need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4450.1s	4450.1	 start having experts in position of power who actually know what they're doing. Well, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4454.6s	4454.6	 have any opposition to the populist wave. I'm making the observation that the effects of some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4462.3s	4462.3	 of the populist movements have started to become too volatile for people to feel like they should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4467.5s	4467.5	 continue forward with that electoral path. That was my observation. Okay, I'm not kind of criticizing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4472.2s	4472.2	 the populist movement. I'm just saying that events like January 6th and the conditions in the UK,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4477.6s	4477.6	 for example, are making people say, wait a second, maybe I need to take pause on the extreme.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4482.2s	4482.2	 The bond market basically fired Liz Truss. I mean, she's not a populist. And Bolsonaro in Brazil,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4489.1s	4489.1	 he actually just lost and there was this big narrative that somehow he was going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4493.7s	4493.7	 not relinquish power and he just announced that he will relinquish power. So, some of the stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4499.2s	4499.2	 is about how populists pose this great danger, I think, is threat inflation. And that the threat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4505.3s	4505.3	 is magnified by elites who want to stay in power. And the truth of the matter is we need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4509.6s	4509.6	 accountability for the people in power. And when they set the wrong policies and decisions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4513.8s	4513.8	 they need to be replaced. No more unaccountability. Yeah, I mean, I just, just to my personal belief,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4521.0s	4521.0	 100% agree. Accountability is what's lacking most across all of these institutions. 100% agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4526.3s	4526.3	 Accountability, maybe competence and also transparency and accountability. Like, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4530.4s	4530.4	 that's what the public wants. I mean, there's no measure by through a one to hear. There's no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4535.1s	4535.1	 water. Hold on a second. Hold on. There's no way to perfectly rock to the pandemic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4539.4s	4539.4	 But in your mistakes, owning them and explaining them would be much better than trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4544.4s	4544.4	 obscurify it and asking for amnesty. You're not if you want to hear an incredibly interesting interview
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4550.8s	4550.8	 because it's very thought provoking of a modern progressive, but with a very different mindset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4558.8s	4558.8	 Or sorry, you know, maybe you don't want to call him a progressive, but is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4563.3s	4563.3	 president of El Salvador, Naib Buckeli. And he did this incredible interview with Tucker Carlson
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4568.1s	4568.1	 on Fox News. I encourage everybody to watch it on both sides of the political spectrum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4573.5s	4573.5	 That man is impressive. Did we just get an admission that your mouth watches Tucker?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4578.8s	4578.8	 I watched I watched that interview. You watched the Tucker. Oh, my Lord. Jason's head's exploding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4583.0s	4583.0	 You know, because I try not to be a moment's ignoramus. It's an entertainer. I like to watch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4588.2s	4588.2	 things on both sides. But that interview is incredible. He is unbelievably impressive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4592.0s	4592.0	 And it's a it double clicks into, you know, the skepticism that smart people like him,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4599.2s	4599.2	 the outsider class has with the insider expert class in a nutshell, if you want to see it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4604.2s	4604.2	 I would encourage you to watch this interview because it's incredible. Incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4609.0s	4609.0	 Jason, the peasants with pitchforks are rising up against this elite class who've put themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4614.6s	4614.6	 up. They've set themselves up as lords. They want exclusive control over their blue checks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4620.5s	4620.5	 And we're about to overturn this establishment because it is corrupt and it is incompetent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4627.8s	4627.8	 It would be great if the people who worked for us were confident and owned and were transparent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4633.2s	4633.2	 You know, I think that's why people are opting out of this is they don't feel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4638.5s	4638.5	 that there's a level of competence in these institutions, nor ownership and transparency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4643.7s	4643.7	 And it really is frustrating, whether it's education or health, or, you know, and any of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4649.8s	4649.8	 these topics we've talked about here on the show, let's go to science corner and we can wrap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4654.2s	4654.2	 What do you got for you, Burke, for us to mock? I think we were going to cover the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4659.3s	4659.3	 Facebook meta announcement that their AI research team had generated the physical structure of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4666.4s	4666.4	 617 million proteins from these metagenomic data sets. And so remember Alpha Fold made this big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4673.6s	4673.6	 announcement that they had highly accurate predictions of protein structure, the three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4678.4s	4678.4	 dimensional shape of proteins. And remember, proteins are kind of the machines of biology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4683.0s	4683.0	 that do everything from catalysis to enzymes where they break stuff down. And they're like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4688.2s	4688.2	 they have all this structure that allows them to do specific physical things. And proteins are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4692.5s	4692.5	 coded in DNA. Every three letters of DNA codes for an amino acid, a string of amino acids makes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4698.1s	4698.1	 a protein. And so we have about a million species where we've sequenced the entire genome of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4705.3s	4705.3	 species, only about 3000 animals, by the way, including humans, half a million from bacterial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4711.4s	4711.4	 species, and then a bunch of viruses and other stuff, but call it about a million species that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4715.9s	4715.9	 we've sequenced. And so, you know, earlier this year, Google's Alpha Fold project published the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4722.6s	4722.6	 3D structure of 200 million proteins that they had derived from the whole genome databases that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4728.6s	4728.6	 existed, where we've gone through and figured out what's the full DNA sequence of all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4732.1s	4732.1	 different species. Now, when you look at the DNA in the environment around us, you were just to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4738.8s	4738.8	 take the DNA out, it turns out that we have seen very little of that DNA. The vast majority of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4745.5s	4745.5	 DNA that you would find in a teaspoon of soil, for example, we've never classified, it's not part
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4751.7s	4751.7	 of a species that we've actually built the whole genome around. We may not even know what species
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4756.1s	4756.1	 that DNA is from. And so when you take a teaspoon of soil, you'll get about 100 billion microorganisms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4762.0s	4762.0	 in that soil from about a million unique species. But you don't see those species because the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4766.9s	4766.9	 DNA sequencing or shotgun sequencing works is DNA is chopped up into little 250 base pair likes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4773.8s	4773.8	 little 250 strands. And those 250 letters are read at a time. And then statistically, bioinformatics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4780.7s	4780.7	 puts together all of that little DNA segments and tries to create long strands of DNA to figure out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4785.8s	4785.8	 what the genes are or what the whole genome is. And so shotgun sequencing gives us kind of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4791.2s	4791.2	 snapshot of the DNA. But until we've done the hard work of figuring out the whole genome,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4796.0s	4796.0	 we don't know what species that DNA comes from. So when you take a sample of soil, or you take a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4801.4s	4801.4	 sample of human poop, and you sequence it, or even a teaspoon of ocean water, and you just sequence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4807.0s	4807.0	 the DNA in it, you get all of these little segments of DNA that we've never seen before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4811.5s	4811.5	 And you can string them together statistically because you get lots and lots of copies of them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4815.4s	4815.4	 and you can figure out the overlap, and then you can create these genes. And a gene is a segment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4819.4s	4819.4	 of DNA that codes for a protein. And those genes make up the metagenome, or the combination of all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4825.4s	4825.4	 the genes that we find in a piece of the environment. And that metagenome comes from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4831.3s	4831.3	 millions of species that we've never seen before. So what they did at Meta is they took all of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4837.1s	4837.1	 genes that we pull out of the soil, or we pull out of the ocean, and they picked a bunch of random
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4841.7s	4841.7	 samples. And they then predicted the physical structure of the proteins from just those genes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4848.5s	4848.5	 without knowing what organism they came from. And this gives us a whole new universe of proteins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4854.5s	4854.5	 that we've never classified before or never seen before. Now, I will just speak a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4860.2s	4860.2	 bit critically about it. Number one, they didn't do what AlphaFold did. What AlphaFold did is they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4864.8s	4864.8	 took 3D structures from typically X-ray crystallography, then they took the DNA code,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4870.2s	4870.2	 and they built machine-learn models to figure out the 3D structure from the DNA code.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4874.2s	4874.2	 What these guys did at Meta is they took the 3D structures and the code, and they basically did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4880.9s	4880.9	 a fill-in-the-blank. They found all the metagenome data out of these samples, and a lot of it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4885.5s	4885.5	 missing. And they filled in the missing blanks using common protein structure that existed out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4892.2s	4892.2	 there in the wild that we already knew from the AlphaFold data. And so they did a fill-in-the-blank,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4896.7s	4896.7	 and as a result, it allowed them to very quickly build these 3D models versus doing the hard and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4901.1s	4901.1	 rigorous work that AlphaFold had to do. So they claimed that it was 60 times faster, but it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4905.1s	4905.1	 actually an entirely different technique. And the second thing is that they represent that only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4909.8s	4909.8	 about a third of it is high quality, meaning only about a third of the proteins that they've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4914.0s	4914.0	 created structure for are really useful or that could be applied in terms of this is the real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4919.6s	4919.6	 representation. Now, why is this interesting and important? Proteins can form the basis of new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4924.5s	4924.5	 medicines. So we can find proteins in the soil, genomes in the soil and proteins in the soil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4930.4s	4930.4	 that can kill certain fungal pathogens, that can kill bacteria, and those can be turned into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4935.0s	4935.0	 fungicides. They can be turned into antibiotics. We can find proteins that bind to specific things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4940.8s	4940.8	 We can find proteins that fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, and those proteins can be turned into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4945.2s	4945.2	 new types of fertilizer. So searching through this universe of proteins that exists in the meta-genome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4952.2s	4952.2	 will allow us to find new molecules to do new and interesting things with in the applied engineering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4957.8s	4957.8	 world. And I will say like this is- What would the output of these be is what everybody's going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4962.0s	4962.0	 be thinking? Antibiotics, fertilizers. I mean, the idea of the meta-genome is rather than start with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4967.4s	4967.4	 the species and then take the genes out of it, just go get the genes. The genes are already there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4971.8s	4971.8	 They're in the ocean, they're in the soil, and there's millions of genes, hundreds of millions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4975.8s	4975.8	 billions of genes that we've never seen before. Therefore, there's billions of proteins. Now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4979.8s	4979.8	 we could randomly create proteins, but the number of proteins that could exist is more than the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4984.2s	4984.2	 number of atoms in the universe because remember there's 20 amino acids. So 20 to the 200th power,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4989.8s	4989.8	 or 20 to the 300th power, or 20 to the thousandth power, meaning how many different combinations of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4993.9s	4993.9	 amino acids can you make? That's more than there are atoms in the universe. So the best place to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=4998.6s	4998.6	 start is what evolution has already given us, all the proteins that exist in the environment. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5003.4s	5003.4	 let's go find those proteins in the environment, and then let's figure out what do we think they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5007.1s	5007.1	 can be used for? Can they be used in industrial applications, in medicine? Can they be used in-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5011.7s	5011.7	 Doing them in material science you're saying, correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5014.6s	5014.6	 And so, you know, a lot of drug discovery mines proteins. It tries to find proteins and figure out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5021.1s	5021.1	 what can these proteins be used for? And now we have all these new data sets of proteins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5025.8s	5025.8	 that are being generated from these metagenomes. And so it's amazing. I mean, you know, look at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5030.6s	5030.6	 world around you, look everywhere up and down on the walls, on the ground, below you. There are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5035.3s	5035.3	 billions of species of organisms that we've never classified before that are making billions of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5040.0s	5040.0	 unique proteins that we've never classified before. And any one of them could unlock an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5045.2s	5045.2	 amazing commercial opportunity for industry. So, and for medicine and for human health.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5050.8s	5050.8	 That's what's really exciting about this ability to kind of mine the metagenome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5054.3s	5054.3	 Silly question for you, or maybe not silly. We have gotten the precursors to DNA for meteorites,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5062.4s	5062.4	 if I understand correctly, what do they call them? Nuclear bases?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5066.0s	5066.0	 Euclidic acids?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5067.4s	5067.4	 Yeah. Yeah. Thiamine, etc. Like things that exist in DNA that are precursors. We've never had DNA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5077.8s	5077.8	 from space, obviously, but we could at some point start to find DNA out there in space. And this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5082.4s	5082.4	 could have an even crazier impact on what we built here. Is that the next card to turn over after we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5087.8s	5087.8	 enter human genome what's here? No, I wouldn't say so. Like, I think, look, if there's DNA that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5093.4s	5093.4	 coming to us from meteorites, call it a couple hundred genes, you could pick up a piece of soil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5099.0s	5099.0	 and find over a billion genes in that teaspoon of soil. Right. So we have far more to mine here on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5104.6s	5104.6	 earth and the low cost of DNA sequencing and shotgun sequencing coupled with bioinformatics,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5109.4s	5109.4	 where we take all that. So just to give you guys a sense, when you take a teaspoon of soil and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5113.4s	5113.4	 get the DNA out and you read the DNA out of it, sequence the DNA, that's potentially tens of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5118.5s	5118.5	 gigabytes of data. And then you could do that millions of times over. And then you statistically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5123.4s	5123.4	 can find genes and then statistically estimate what they physically look like, what those proteins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5128.0s	5128.0	 look like. And then you can start to build models around which ones do we want to try and use for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5131.9s	5131.9	 drug applications, which ones do we want to. So there's so much work to do just in terms of what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5137.7s	5137.7	 we have here on earth. And the tools are getting so cheap and so available. There are labs that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5142.6s	5142.6	 all over the world starting to kind of spring up to do this work. It's super exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5146.2s	5146.2	 Jamath, any thoughts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5148.1s	5148.1	 It's kind of, you know, just to put two ideas together. I've said before, like the two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5153.4s	5153.4	 big investable themes that I'm orienting my organization around is this. One is that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5158.3s	5158.3	 marginal cost of energy goes to zero. And the second is that the marginal cost of compute goes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5163.1s	5163.1	 to zero. And the second one is really about shifting compute to more parallelism on GPUs and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5168.2s	5168.2	 ASICs and FPGAs. But that's why all of this stuff is possible. The fact that, you know, meta can do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5174.2s	5174.2	 this and Google can do alpha fold is largely because the cost of all of this stuff is, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5180.3s	5180.3	 know, trivial for these kinds of companies. So it's really exciting. It's going to move science,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5185.7s	5185.7	 in my opinion, out of this in vivo in vitro experimentation model into silica. And so those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5192.3s	5192.3	 who can actually build learning machines will solve some of the most important biological problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5197.3s	5197.3	 So I, I'm a real believer in this stuff. I think it's super exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5200.7s	5200.7	 When do you think this stuff actually hits Friedberg, our life? That's always when people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5205.7s	5205.7	 talk about these discoveries. Yeah, a lot of people don't realize it, but so many molecules
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5210.5s	5210.5	 that that are used in agriculture, like fungicides to kill fungus in the fields, those are derived
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5216.3s	5216.3	 from this sort of work. A lot of antibiotics, a lot of medicines are already derived from mining
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5222.2s	5222.2	 genomes, finding new proteins, and seeing what those proteins can do. Because these proteins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5226.6s	5226.6	 didn't evolve in the environment randomly, they evolved to do something. And in many cases,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5231.2s	5231.2	 we can take that thing that they do and then harness it into a product. And that's what's so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5235.8s	5235.8	 exciting. And this this affects everything material science, you know, agriculture, human health,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5242.1s	5242.1	 it's, it's a food, it's really profound. Awesome. All right, everybody, there you have it. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5247.4s	5247.4	 another all in podcast in the can. By the way, so many so many of Friedberg stands were afraid,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5253.1s	5253.1	 Jay, call that you and I were going to make some joke. And we didn't know we didn't. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5257.3s	5257.3	 for all these stands, I just I hope you guys can exhale. Take a deep breath, man, have some,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5262.5s	5262.5	 you know, eggless mail and enjoy your weekend. Enjoy your week. Bye bye, everybody. See you next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5268.4s	5268.4	 time. Love you besties. Love you guys. Love you besties.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma6XineLufc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=19&t=5283.1s	5283.1	 Love you.
