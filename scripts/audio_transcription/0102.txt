https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=0.0s	0.0	 My stance really took over the comment board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2.6s	2.6	 Yeah, Sax, how was your week off when you gave up on the pod for a week and then did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=8.1s	8.1	 four media appearances for 90 minutes each on other pods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=11.2s	11.2	 You did six hours of pod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=12.3s	12.3	 You took off from this pod to give your ratings to Megyn Kelly and Dave Rubin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=17.0s	17.0	 Yeah, I did a 45 minute hit with Dave Rubin on Ukraine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=21.6s	21.6	 So be sure to check that out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=23.2s	23.2	 And then did I do, no, Megyn Kelly, Freeberg and I did that the week before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=29.2s	29.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=29.6s	29.6	 Surprisingly, she didn't invite you back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=31.4s	31.4	 Yeah, I don't know what could have happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=33.8s	33.8	 It was so great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=34.8s	34.8	 It was so great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=35.8s	35.8	 That was awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=36.3s	36.3	 I love Megyn Kelly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=37.2s	37.2	 Didn't she call you a prick?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=38.4s	38.4	 Yeah, she did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=39.1s	39.1	 She did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=39.7s	39.7	 And she only knew me for 45 minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=41.5s	41.5	 Usually that takes like three or four days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=43.6s	43.6	 She just got right to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=59.0s	59.0	 Sax, we have not had such negative panning comments on YouTube since J.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=66.6s	66.6	 Cal got Brigadooned for his pro Ukraine rhetoric a few weeks ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=70.6s	70.6	 Now I'm getting Brigadooned for Sax not showing up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=73.3s	73.3	 I get Brigadooned for asking him a question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=75.5s	75.5	 Then I get Brigadooned from him not showing up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=77.2s	77.2	 So maybe you're not getting Brigadooned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=78.0s	78.0	 I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=78.4s	78.4	 Maybe it's just honest commentary from the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=79.9s	79.9	 When will you guys realize that there are three to five million people a week that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=84.3s	84.3	 listen to this podcast?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=86.0s	86.0	 A hundred nitwits who comment on YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=89.1s	89.1	 They're neither right nor wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=90.7s	90.7	 They should just be completely ignored.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=93.1s	93.1	 Turn the comments off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=94.0s	94.0	 The only thing that matters are the ratings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=95.9s	95.9	 If you care about that at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=97.4s	97.4	 And last week was one of the best rated shows we've ever done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=100.8s	100.8	 I think it was highest rated after Elon's episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=103.1s	103.1	 It would have been even better with David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=105.2s	105.2	 So we should Brigadoon the Brigadooners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=108.2s	108.2	 Those nitwits should be ignored.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=110.2s	110.2	 I think this is a little bit like a band where like you can't mess with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=114.4s	114.4	 chemistry of the band.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=115.7s	115.7	 And that's the lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=117.2s	117.2	 Even though there's a lot of infighting in the band, like it just works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=121.5s	121.5	 It works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=122.0s	122.0	 And so you don't want to second guess it too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=124.2s	124.2	 Well, and then if somebody from the band gets sick and somebody sits in, even if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=127.8s	127.8	 it's like you get some incredible guitar players sit in, people are like, that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=130.8s	130.8	 not the guitar player who I have the t-shirt of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=133.9s	133.9	 I need my guitar player back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=136.1s	136.1	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=136.4s	136.4	 Anyway, well, I'm just glad Ringo showed up 22 minutes late.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=139.4s	139.4	 Welcome back, Freeberg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=141.0s	141.0	 Let's get started.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=145.0s	145.0	 I don't need to fuck with the band.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=146.6s	146.6	 I'm not going to fuck with the band.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=148.5s	148.5	 Ringo was an underrated drummer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=151.4s	151.4	 Freeberg, you have a role here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=154.3s	154.3	 That's amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=155.0s	155.0	 I think you're more like the drummer, Jake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=157.4s	157.4	 Freeberg, maybe bass player.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=160.5s	160.5	 You know I'm John Lennon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=161.6s	161.6	 This is George Harrison.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=162.6s	162.6	 George Harrison.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=163.4s	163.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=163.8s	163.8	 Actually, George Harrison, very underrated, but I, you know, I'm, I'm pretty clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=166.8s	166.8	 Have you guys ever heard the version of Blackbird that Paul Bacardini did just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=171.9s	171.9	 with the ukulele?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=173.0s	173.0	 No, I'd like to hear that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=174.4s	174.4	 Maybe one of the best songs ever recorded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=177.0s	177.0	 One of the best records I've ever heard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=178.5s	178.5	 Fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=178.9s	178.9	 Incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=180.1s	180.1	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=180.4s	180.4	 Listen, there's so much to start with, but I think...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=182.3s	182.3	 Blackbird swimming in the dead of night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=185.6s	185.6	 Take these broken wings and learn to fly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=190.2s	190.2	 All sacks life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=193.0s	193.0	 Sacks, were you at a building on Market Street yesterday by any chance?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=197.7s	197.7	 No fly zone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=198.6s	198.6	 The homeless shelter?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=202.4s	202.4	 I think you're talking about abandoned homeless shelter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=206.2s	206.2	 I think it's fair to say that there will be a lot of people that we know that will go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=211.9s	211.9	 and help make Market Street better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=214.9s	214.9	 Make Market Street great again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=217.0s	217.0	 Make Market Street great again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=218.4s	218.4	 Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=219.1s	219.1	 Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=219.9s	219.9	 I'm looking forward to some tofu salads and meditation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=224.0s	224.0	 Namaste.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=225.6s	225.6	 Literally, I think 8,000 square feet is meditation rooms that haven't been used in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=229.7s	229.7	 five years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=230.5s	230.5	 Quite honestly, though, like on the other side of this, I would say Parag Agrawal does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=233.8s	233.8	 deserve a statue for shareholder value creation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=236.6s	236.6	 What 54.20 a share, which by the way, we said was going to happen and it did happen, was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=242.6s	242.6	 ginormous in this market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=244.6s	244.6	 And I just want to see the look on that barista's face when they're warming up the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=249.8s	249.8	 oat milk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=251.8s	251.8	 When a band of very, very tough knuckled company builders walks through that door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=259.6s	259.6	 Yeah, the only has left the building.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=261.8s	261.8	 Let's just leave it at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=262.8s	262.8	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=263.7s	263.7	 So I guess we can talk about it now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=265.8s	265.8	 Elon has closed the deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=267.9s	267.9	 We can talk about it now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=269.9s	269.9	 Well, no, I'm just saying, Sax and I could not talk about this because we had, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=273.9s	273.9	 we couldn't talk about it for legal reasons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=276.3s	276.3	 They deserve a statue in front of the bronze statue for shareholder value creation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=281.8s	281.8	 market in front of that Twitter building.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=283.6s	283.6	 Best tech CEO of the year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=287.0s	287.0	 Parag Agrawal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=288.0s	288.0	 Hold on a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=288.6s	288.6	 So your theory is that he did such a bad job in terms of suppressing viewpoints and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=295.6s	295.6	 censorship that he actually induced Elon to want to buy the company so he could fix
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=301.9s	301.9	 their censorship problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=303.2s	303.2	 No, my theory, my theory is simpler than this, which is they got great representation to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=310.6s	310.6	 do a very bulletproof deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=313.4s	313.4	 And it turns out that contract law still matters in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=317.7s	317.7	 And Elon did the right thing and just said, you know what, I'm going to own this thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=321.1s	321.1	 and probably double or triple my money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=323.0s	323.0	 So I'm just going to go and do it and I'll do it for the benefit of everybody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=327.2s	327.2	 But my point is more that they and the board had the wherewithal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=333.3s	333.3	 To fight because, you know, that they could have easily gotten intimidated and capitulated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=339.0s	339.0	 And in doing that, whether they were right or wrong or good or bad is irrelevant to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=343.6s	343.6	 They represented shareholder values well, and they got shareholders paid in a moment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=347.8s	347.8	 where the stock market is still down 20, 30, 40 percent, where big tech is down 50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=352.6s	352.6	 percent. Some of these big tech companies are on 80 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=355.7s	355.7	 These guys sold the company at a premium.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=357.6s	357.6	 And so that just, you know, we just have to acknowledge that that happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=360.5s	360.5	 That's all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=361.4s	361.4	 Well, and to just give you a little bit of background on Twitter, historically, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=364.9s	364.9	 in 2013, the stock was trading at sixty nine dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=370.1s	370.1	 And it got sold for fifty four.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=372.0s	372.0	 Like this company has been sideways for a decade, essentially, in terms of its market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=377.2s	377.2	 cap. And so but there's no doubt that I think Elon can turn this around pretty quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=385.6s	385.6	 And to make it massively profitable, I think, and clean up the bot problem very quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=391.5s	391.5	 If you can land two rockets at a time, create self-driving cars, I think you can figure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=395.6s	395.6	 this out. This isn't rocket science and the Elon's done rocket science.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=400.0s	400.0	 So I think he's going to figure it out. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=402.1s	402.1	 Yeah, for what it's worth, I think Elon's really excited about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=404.7s	404.7	 And there is tremendous potential at Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=408.2s	408.2	 I mean, the company's been sideways because it hasn't done that much in 10 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=412.0s	412.0	 But there's so much you can do with that product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=414.3s	414.3	 It's just, you know, there's a ton of potential.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=417.2s	417.2	 I think the best way to think about it is he bought a quarter of a billion mouths for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=422.2s	422.2	 forty four billion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=424.1s	424.1	 And in the grand scheme of things, that is, I think, going to turn out to be pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=429.3s	429.3	 reasonably cheap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=431.8s	431.8	 Especially if he can layer in a few of his bigger ideas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=434.7s	434.7	 And. And I think that those mouths, the value of those monthly active users could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=440.7s	440.7	 probably double or triple pretty quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=442.3s	442.3	 Right. I think that was the so I just sent you guys this link from this analyst.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=447.5s	447.5	 And he said that Twitter was bought at one hundred and seventy two dollars per monthly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=452.2s	452.2	 active user compared to eighty one dollars per monthly active user at Metta, where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=457.8s	457.8	 they sit today. So but that's but that's for a very different point, which we can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=462.2s	462.2	 double click into because Metta is its own bag of you know, it's a little bit of it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=467.2s	467.2	 unfortunately. You know, a bit of a ghost or fire attached to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=471.4s	471.4	 Well, and I'll explain why, because the Metta problem is it's it's a deep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=478.0s	478.0	 And a very dangerous situation that they've put themselves in, which is why their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=482.0s	482.0	 malvalues are this low.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=485.7s	485.7	 But, you know, if you had done this analysis a few years ago, the trade was looking at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=491.0s	491.0	 Metta's malvalues being so high where you would have said, why isn't Twitter doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=495.2s	495.2	 more? So I know that this this is a little bit, in my opinion, cherry picking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=499.2s	499.2	 Yeah. Well, I think making everything verified in a path to verification, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=504.0s	504.0	 you want us talked about publicly many times and payments, you know, it's talked about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=508.1s	508.1	 publicly many times, just those two things alone could make the experience of being on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=513.2s	513.2	 Twitter absolutely delightful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=515.6s	515.6	 If everybody could verify themselves, this thing could turn around so quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=518.7s	518.7	 I'll say I'll say what you're saying in a slightly more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=520.6s	520.6	 I think the most powerful change that Twitter could make today is there are two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=526.5s	526.5	 classes of users, people who are verified, real world identity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=532.1s	532.1	 Yeah. And people who want to stay anonymous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=535.0s	535.0	 Correct. There is a 100 percent distribution firehose for people who are real.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=539.8s	539.8	 And there is a firehose for fake people or fake names that you need to pay to amplify.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=547.0s	547.0	 Just that one simple change will cut through all the nonsense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=550.4s	550.4	 Because if you want to see where the money is being spent, you will be able to see very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=555.8s	555.8	 quickly because otherwise there'll be virtually no distribution for anonymous fake people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=560.9s	560.9	 And it'll force those people if they really want to be heard and that there's something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=565.1s	565.1	 valuable to say to spend against it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=568.5s	568.5	 Well, this really is about the Brigadoons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=570.5s	570.5	 And Elon's been very clear about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=572.3s	572.3	 You know, it's pretty easy to get rid of the bots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=574.7s	574.7	 And if people are opting in to putting themselves into the top class of verified users, well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=579.7s	579.7	 that's a revenue stream. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=581.2s	581.2	 And so all of a sudden, you know, I don't know how many millions of people would instantly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=585.3s	585.3	 say I'll pay for this for five or 10 bucks a month to be verified.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=588.1s	588.1	 I think you're right. And I think like what we want to do is like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=591.2s	591.2	 you know, no offense to all the people out there, although I don't really care, but no offense, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=596.3s	596.3	 you cannot use Twitter as a coping mechanism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=598.8s	598.8	 Okay. Like I get that life is hard or that, you know, life hasn't lived out to your expectations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=604.9s	604.9	 or, you know, there's envy and whatever of other people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=607.8s	607.8	 But to go out there and spew hate doesn't solve anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=611.9s	611.9	 Are you talking about the Brigadoons?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=613.6s	613.6	 Well, there's also just a lot of people that are just in general.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=617.8s	617.8	 They're just, they're just mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=619.7s	619.7	 And I'll give you a perfect example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=621.3s	621.3	 There was a woman that I saw on TikTok and she's like, you know, been married for 13 years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=627.5s	627.5	 mother of two kids.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=629.4s	629.4	 And she was, she had a thing that went viral where she was talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=634.0s	634.0	 who's in charge, her or her husband.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=635.8s	635.8	 And it was a very funny little thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=637.0s	637.0	 And so I followed a couple of her videos just to see what else she had posted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=641.1s	641.1	 And one of the videos was how she has some complicated health issues, which she was very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=645.4s	645.4	 public about PCOS and how it causes, you know, issues in losing weight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=650.8s	650.8	 And she posted a pre and post picture of her, which takes a lot of courage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=656.2s	656.2	 And she was like Brigadoon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=658.6s	658.6	 And it's like, what is wrong with these broken people that have to give this woman a hard time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=665.1s	665.1	 And it just, it took, so to me, these social media channels are not coping mechanisms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=670.2s	670.2	 They were never meant to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=671.6s	671.6	 And so, you know, if they have to go to 4chan or 8chan or Reddit or whatever,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=677.6s	677.6	 better to sort of create these honey pots of hatred,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=681.2s	681.2	 than to have it spew everywhere because it makes for the rest of us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=684.2s	684.2	 these platforms to be unusable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=686.0s	686.0	 Well, Sax, you were the COO of PayPal with Elon and Rulof and TL and everybody in that crew
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=692.9s	692.9	 over 20 years ago and verified.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=695.5s	695.5	 You understand pretty well because you yourself have been Brigadooned of late
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=699.8s	699.8	 and you've experienced this first hand, the psychological torture that made you take a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=705.0s	705.0	 week off from the show, in fact, because you were so under duress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=708.1s	708.1	 I'm kidding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=709.0s	709.0	 You had a planned week off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=709.9s	709.9	 So you're allowed to have occasion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=711.6s	711.6	 Which of the two ideas is the bigger idea?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=713.7s	713.7	 Payments, making Twitter into PayPal, including that x.com, which was the original name of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=719.4s	719.4	 that was Elon's payment company and he owns a domain x.com.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=723.5s	723.5	 Which is a bigger idea, the payments or the verification?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=728.4s	728.4	 Which is the bigger idea for increasing shareholder value?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=731.7s	731.7	 Which would you do first?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=732.5s	732.5	 I mean, payments is an entire roadmap, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=736.0s	736.0	 So there's a lot that could be done there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=738.0s	738.0	 Explain that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=738.4s	738.4	 Well, I mean, it's about, I mean, you could layer on a lot of services on top of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=743.8s	743.8	 So it's not just like one feature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=747.0s	747.0	 Look, I think they're both compelling in terms of where they could lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=749.3s	749.3	 I think what's amazing about Elon as an entrepreneur is he always starts with a mission
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=755.4s	755.4	 and then he figures out how to turn it into a great product and a great business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=759.0s	759.0	 So for example, with SpaceX, the mission was to get to Mars to make life multi-planetary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=764.6s	764.6	 You would think that'd be a spectacularly unprofitable business, but in the course
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=769.3s	769.3	 of pursuing that mission, he figured out the launch business and then the satellite business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=773.1s	773.1	 with Starlink and I think Starlink is going to be a phenomenal business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=776.4s	776.4	 Phenomenal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=776.9s	776.9	 And likewise with Tesla, he started with the mission of moving the world to sustainable energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=782.5s	782.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=783.0s	783.0	 And in the process of doing that, he created the world's best car,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=786.3s	786.3	 not just the world's best electric car, but I just think it's the best car in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=789.9s	789.9	 And Tesla is this amazing business today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=791.8s	791.8	 It's so far ahead of every other car company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=793.9s	793.9	 So look, I think what's cool about what Elon is doing is he's starting with this mission
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=799.1s	799.1	 of restoring Twitter to being a free speech platform of being the town square.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=804.3s	804.3	 It was always meant to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=805.8s	805.8	 And in the process of doing that, he's going to figure out how to make Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=809.0s	809.0	 into an even better product and into a great business, which is not today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=813.0s	813.0	 I think Twitter's losing a few hundred million dollars a quarter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=816.2s	816.2	 So there's work to do on all those fronts, but I think it's really impressive to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=822.3s	822.3	 And he's still operating at the top of his game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=824.6s	824.6	 I mean, 20 years after PayPal, some of us are just doing a podcast, but he's still operating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=830.2s	830.2	 Some of us are tired.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=831.1s	831.1	 Some of us are exhausted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=832.1s	832.1	 I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=833.1s	833.1	 We're tired, but-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=834.1s	834.1	 We're tired and he's working 16 hour days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=836.4s	836.4	 He's been leveling up for 20 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=838.8s	838.8	 And at this point, he's like a level 99 major something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=842.4s	842.4	 No, he's like a crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=845.0s	845.0	 That's amazing to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=846.9s	846.9	 Freeburg, the biggest issue I perceive in the short term for Twitter is going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=852.6s	852.6	 what to do with people like Trump and Kanye West or Ye.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=857.4s	857.4	 And of course, that's all going to seem like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=860.6s	860.6	 Elon is making those decisions as an individual as opposed to for the platform, etc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=865.2s	865.2	 Should he let somebody like Kanye West?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=868.4s	868.4	 I'm sorry, Ye is like, call himself who was in the middle of an obvious manic episode
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=872.4s	872.4	 back on the platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=873.9s	873.9	 Should he let Trump back on the platform?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=875.6s	875.6	 How do you think he should handle those two polarizing individuals specifically?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=880.3s	880.3	 Look, I mean, I think this is what's going to be really interesting to watch because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=884.2s	884.2	 there have been very successful, very inspirational, very intelligent, very creative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=890.4s	890.4	 entrepreneurs that have started and built generally kind of open platforms at the beginning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=896.6s	896.6	 only to over time be challenged with the content that doesn't feel appropriate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=903.6s	903.6	 And then they come back and they make the necessary kind of moderation guidelines and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=907.0s	907.0	 they make the necessary edits to the way the platform operates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=909.8s	909.8	 This is how Google operated originally, you know, and then they ended up saying, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=914.0s	914.0	 what, if we're going to be in China, we do have to create a censored version of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=917.0s	917.0	 internet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=917.3s	917.3	 And they did that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=918.2s	918.2	 And that was controversial with YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=920.4s	920.4	 They've got a lot of sensory and it was supposed to be just a generally open platform for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=924.2s	924.2	 anyone to use.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=924.9s	924.9	 And they were even Larry and Sergey were kind of flouting DMCA at the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=929.3s	929.3	 And they were like, it's not our job to monitor copyright.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=931.4s	931.4	 You have to file a takedown notice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=933.0s	933.0	 And they kind of waved their hands in the air over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=936.0s	936.0	 They realized that that could actually damage and completely ruin the platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=938.9s	938.9	 And they had to go in and create guidelines and moderation systems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=942.0s	942.0	 And the same was true of Ev and Jack and Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=946.0s	946.0	 The same was true of the founders at Reddit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=948.1s	948.1	 And I don't know if you guys, you know, remember that period of time when Ellen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=951.3s	951.3	 Powell was CEO of Reddit and she went in and cleaned up a lot of the bullying and harassment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=956.2s	956.2	 and nastiness that was going on on Reddit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=957.9s	957.9	 And she got a lot of controversy for why are you closing it down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=960.6s	960.6	 Why are you censoring it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=962.1s	962.1	 Elon is a reasonable person and he's going to be faced with unreasonable people on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=966.7s	966.7	 platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=967.8s	967.8	 And when that happens, he's going to have very tough decisions to make about what kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=971.5s	971.5	 of platform he wants to have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=972.6s	972.6	 What's the quality of that platform going to need to look like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=975.2s	975.2	 And then all of a sudden he's going to have to look in the mirror and say, did I step
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=978.5s	978.5	 on the wrong side?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=979.8s	979.8	 And, you know, he's idealistic and it's great and it's wonderful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=983.2s	983.2	 And I hope that he's successful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=984.7s	984.7	 But to some degree, some amount of moderation is going to be necessary to create a high
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=988.6s	988.6	 quality product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=989.2s	989.2	 Would you allow, would you, if you were in charge yourself, Freeberg, would you put Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=995.4s	995.4	 back on the platform and under what circumstances?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=997.5s	997.5	 And would you allow somebody like Kanye West back on the platform at some point?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1001.9s	1001.9	 Me personally?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1003.4s	1003.4	 Yeah, you personally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1004.3s	1004.3	 Yeah, I think I can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1005.0s	1005.0	 I'm personally on those two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1006.5s	1006.5	 Yeah, look, my content moderation guidelines, you know, it gets very nuanced very quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1011.5s	1011.5	 What do you allow people to say?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1012.5s	1012.5	 What are you not allowing them to say?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1013.9s	1013.9	 And then if they violate them, is there the opportunity for a lifetime ban?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1017.6s	1017.6	 I don't think so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1018.2s	1018.2	 I don't think anyone should have a lifetime ban on these platforms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1020.2s	1020.2	 So I'm totally fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1021.4s	1021.4	 Would you do that for Kanye West, who has been saying crazy anti-Semitic stuff, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1025.5s	1025.5	 has real world danger?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1026.9s	1026.9	 That's already started to spill over where people are putting up banners like Kanye's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1030.2s	1030.2	 right about the Jews and they're putting up banners like over the, you know, 10 freeway,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1035.4s	1035.4	 as you may have seen in Los Angeles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1036.7s	1036.7	 How would you deal with Kanye specifically in a manic anti-Semitic episode that he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1040.6s	1040.6	 been in?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1040.9s	1040.9	 Look, I think the question is anyone that's saying anything racist or whatever might be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1045.4s	1045.4	 deemed kind of to fall in that category, there is a tagging mechanism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1050.9s	1050.9	 You have to figure out how to create the tagging mechanism based on that tagging mechanism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1055.6s	1055.6	 The default is it's like when you go to Google and you search for stuff, they exclude porn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1059.5s	1059.5	 So all porn content that's indexed on Google's index servers is indexed as porn and it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1066.6s	1066.6	 default off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1067.9s	1067.9	 There's a safe search thing you got to turn, I think, off or something to access stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1073.0s	1073.0	 that Google deems inappropriate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1074.9s	1074.9	 Sorry, how do you do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1080.0s	1080.0	 No, but I think, and by the way, I'll tell you, when I worked at Google, we used to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1083.0s	1083.0	 pizza weekends where you would go into the office on the weekends, they give you free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1086.3s	1086.3	 pizza and everyone would tag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1088.4s	1088.4	 You'd watch porn and you would tag porn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1090.8s	1090.8	 And so you basically go through the indexing servers, they'd show you images and Google
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1094.2s	1094.2	 images and you click porn or not porn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1096.3s	1096.3	 And it was just like, hey, come and volunteer, come and help us do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1098.6s	1098.6	 And there was all these engineers sitting in the frigging cafeteria tagging porn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1102.4s	1102.4	 But actually, you know, that happened to Saks and he saw Tucker Carlson and he said, yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1106.5s	1106.5	 that's porn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1107.0s	1107.0	 That's my personal porn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1109.0s	1109.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1109.1s	1109.1	 So I think I think the same mechanism is needed on these social networks, which is that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1114.7s	1114.7	 have to figure out a way to use AI.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1118.2s	1118.2	 To tag content and think about them as cable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1120.7s	1120.7	 Just let me finish for one second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1121.8s	1121.8	 You think about them as cable, cable stations on a cable company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1124.7s	1124.7	 So they're the cable company and there's different stations and you as a user decide what do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1129.4s	1129.4	 you not want to opt into and what do you want to opt into?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1131.6s	1131.6	 What content do you want to exclude from your version and your experience of Twitter?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1135.8s	1135.8	 And if you're okay with the stuff Kanye says, you're okay with the stuff Trump says, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1139.5s	1139.5	 can keep that stuff in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1140.6s	1140.6	 If you want to exclude that type of content, it's excluded for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1144.4s	1144.4	 And I think that's what Twitter ultimately has to become.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1146.8s	1146.8	 What do you think Chamath, would you put Trump back on the platform and seeing, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1151.5s	1151.5	 Kanye West having this manic episode and saying, you know, basically participating in hate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1156.0s	1156.0	 speech explicitly?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1157.8s	1157.8	 How would you handle those two specific instances in 2022 going into 2023?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1163.0s	1163.0	 I think that there has to be a way where nobody is banned forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1169.4s	1169.4	 I think that when somebody is banned temporarily, they can be banned for any reason that violates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1175.6s	1175.6	 a term of service that's well understood and uniformly enforced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1179.8s	1179.8	 Got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1180.1s	1180.1	 And I think that's the right of a private company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1182.9s	1182.9	 But there has to be a way to get back on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1185.8s	1185.8	 In the case of both of these folks, there should be a way to basically, you know, have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1193.5s	1193.5	 because of the step, the quantity of their reach, some sort of almost like tribunal or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1201.6s	1201.6	 mediator that can understand what's going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1206.6s	1206.6	 Because if somebody is going through a manic episode, it's absolutely right to turn that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1210.6s	1210.6	 off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1210.9s	1210.9	 I mean, these guys should have turned him off much, much sooner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1215.9s	1215.9	 Because when you're in the middle of a mania, and I said this last week, like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1219.8s	1219.8	 like, for example, like this, this relative of mine, when they're in a manic episode,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1224.0s	1224.0	 it's 60, 70, 80 emails a day and text messages, 100 texts that I get.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1231.0s	1231.0	 And they're, honestly, they're vile.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1234.1s	1234.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1234.8s	1234.8	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1235.1s	1235.1	 And they don't even remember them half the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1237.0s	1237.0	 And they don't even know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1238.6s	1238.6	 And, you know, they go through paranoia, they go through mania, they go through these periods
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1242.6s	1242.6	 where they think they're completely right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1244.5s	1244.5	 They go through these periods where they look completely sane and normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1249.1s	1249.1	 So the most important thing when you have a family member in mental health crisis is to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1254.9s	1254.9	 get the phone away from them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1256.4s	1256.4	 That is a weapon that only continues the loop and to re-regulate this person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1261.9s	1261.9	 And then there should be a way to prove that you're back in a re-regulated state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1266.9s	1266.9	 to get these tools back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1268.1s	1268.1	 But I think that that needs to, we just need to acknowledge that there's just a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1272.8s	1272.8	 people with mental health issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1273.9s	1273.9	 There's a lot of social media.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1275.5s	1275.5	 There's a lot of damage that can be done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1278.0s	1278.0	 It's not to forgive these people, but it's to explain that in moments, you've got to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1281.6s	1281.6	 shut these channels down and then give them a way to come back when they've re-regulated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1286.2s	1286.2	 Sax, how do you think about it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1288.5s	1288.5	 Well, with regard to Trump, I don't know what the continuing reason is for him not being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1293.8s	1293.8	 allowed on the platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1295.1s	1295.1	 Remember that when he was banned, it was considered to be a temporary measure because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1301.4s	1301.4	 he was supposedly inciting a riot, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1304.5s	1304.5	 So I think incitement to violence is legitimate grounds for taking down speech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1310.6s	1310.6	 But once that breach of the peace is over, I don't know why it would become a permanent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1315.4s	1315.4	 ban as opposed to a timeout.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1317.0s	1317.0	 So I don't even know how the companies continue to justify the ban on Trump, except for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1323.0s	1323.0	 fact that they just think that he's a threat to democracy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1325.4s	1325.4	 Well, I don't think that's for social networks to determine is that who gets to participate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1331.4s	1331.4	 in our political process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1333.3s	1333.3	 So it's not necessarily the first thing I would do, but do I think that Trump should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1337.5s	1337.5	 be allowed back?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1338.2s	1338.2	 Yeah, I do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1339.6s	1339.6	 With regard to Kanye, it's a little more complicated because like you're saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1345.4s	1345.4	 it's hard to know whether he's having a manic episode or he's just, you know, being Kanye.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1350.3s	1350.3	 What he's saying right now is probably not in his own interest and probably would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1353.4s	1353.4	 in his best interest to have a timeout.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1355.4s	1355.4	 But what I would look for guidance here is there is a Supreme Court decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1360.7s	1360.7	 And my general view on the content moderation is that these social networking companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1366.3s	1366.3	 should be looking for inspiration to Supreme Court decisions because the Supreme Court's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1371.1s	1371.1	 been wrestling with these issues for hundreds of years, whereas social networks are just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1375.0s	1375.0	 making it up as they go along.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1377.0s	1377.0	 And there are nine major categories of speech that the Supreme Court has said are not protected
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1381.9s	1381.9	 because they actually are dangerous speech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1383.9s	1383.9	 So, for example, in this decision called Choplinski versus New Hampshire, which came out in 1942,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1390.3s	1390.3	 the Supreme Court held that so-called fighting words were not protected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1394.8s	1394.8	 And they defined fighting words as speech that tends to incite an immediate breach of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1399.4s	1399.4	 the peace through the use of, quote, personally abusive language that when addressed, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1404.6s	1404.6	 ordinary citizen is, as a matter of common knowledge, inherently likely to provoke a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1408.6s	1408.6	 violent reaction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1410.0s	1410.0	 So, you know, I would use that type of decision by the Supreme Court as inspiration to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1417.3s	1417.3	 that racist, misogynistic, homophobic and other racial and ethnic slurs shouldn't be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1425.2s	1425.2	 allowed on these networks because it doesn't do anything to enhance the public debate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1430.2s	1430.2	 Now, there is a question like, could Kanye frame his arguments in a way that is still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1435.6s	1435.6	 incredibly offensive to us, but doesn't use slurs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1439.8s	1439.8	 Yeah, for example, he could say, hey, here are the top 10 media companies, here are the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1443.4s	1443.4	 executives, here's the percentage that are Jewish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1445.8s	1445.8	 And this is, you know, my concern is that this is a and here's the percentage of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1449.2s	1449.2	 are Jewish in the population, you could some bullshit like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1451.8s	1451.8	 And then you're like, okay, did he say something anti-Semitic?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1454.6s	1454.6	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1455.0s	1455.0	 You know, and you're kind of in this bubble area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1457.9s	1457.9	 And there's always going to be edge cases and people are always going to be pushing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1460.4s	1460.4	 the envelope.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1461.1s	1461.1	 And so listen, just because we find it offensive, and, you know, it's specifically offensive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1466.6s	1466.6	 to me, that doesn't mean that it should automatically be banned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1470.0s	1470.0	 So I think slurs, slurs, banned or out, but, but arguments, I don't know that we should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1475.1s	1475.1	 be banning entire categories of arguments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1477.1s	1477.1	 And look, part of the problem here is that lots of people are hearing the arguments that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1482.0s	1482.0	 Ye is making, whether he's making them on Twitter or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1484.6s	1484.6	 And because he's there's a total ban, people can't really engage with him on Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1490.6s	1490.6	 And so he's not getting off ramped from this rabbit hole he's falling into.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1495.2s	1495.2	 And nobody else who might be a fan of his is hearing the other side of the argument.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1499.6s	1499.6	 So I don't know that it's ultimately in the long term interest of the town square to be banning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1506.6s	1506.6	 You know, the argument, the, you know, ACLU and other people have is like, hey, you put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1510.6s	1510.6	 a little sunlight on these bad opinions, at least everybody knows who has the bad opinions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1515.0s	1515.0	 and you can fight them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1516.3s	1516.3	 Paradoxically, while we're talking, I mean, do you really want these folks going to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1519.4s	1519.4	 dark web and, you know, being untraceable, there is some value in kind of knowing who's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1524.1s	1524.1	 getting radicalized and hopefully exposing them to other opinions in the same conversation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1528.6s	1528.6	 that can off ramp them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1529.8s	1529.8	 Yeah, I mean, paradoxically, while we're talking, Elon just tweeted at 1118 am,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1534.7s	1534.7	 Twitter will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints, no matter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1539.3s	1539.3	 no major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1543.7s	1543.7	 convenes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1544.5s	1544.5	 So he's going to take the same approach that Facebook has.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1547.3s	1547.3	 They have a council as well that Zuckerberg tried to set up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1550.2s	1550.2	 So I think he realizes there should be a thoughtful discussion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1553.5s	1553.5	 Saks, are you going to be on that council?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1555.1s	1555.1	 I have no idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1556.0s	1556.0	 That sounds like a, the worst purgatory you could ever be in is to be the person who has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1561.0s	1561.0	 to make these decisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1562.1s	1562.1	 Like talk about a no win situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1564.5s	1564.5	 I'm curious, Shamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1565.8s	1565.8	 We talked last week about Kanye and then Lex Friedman dropped his episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1569.8s	1569.8	 Lex came at it with, he pushed back on Kanye.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1573.5s	1573.5	 I don't know if you watch some of the highlights.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1574.8s	1574.8	 I saw some of the highs he pushed back pretty hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1576.2s	1576.2	 Watch the whole thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1577.1s	1577.1	 Okay, so he pushed back really hard on the anti semitic stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1580.6s	1580.6	 And we had a discussion last week, I said, Hey, you can't platform this guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1583.6s	1583.6	 But it looks like Lex had a specific point of view, which is he has a friendship with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1589.9s	1589.9	 Kanye of some level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1591.2s	1591.2	 And he wanted to try to convince him in this manicness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1594.4s	1594.4	 That he's wrong about things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1595.4s	1595.4	 Did, do you think Lex succeeded and he should have done it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1598.2s	1598.2	 Obviously we won't question Lex's intent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1599.9s	1599.9	 We know it's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1600.7s	1600.7	 I have had replaced Lex with me and Kanye with my relative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1608.1s	1608.1	 Wasn't on television or whatever, but I've had these same kinds of, I'll call them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1612.8s	1612.8	 interventions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1614.2s	1614.2	 And like I said, this person goes through periods of lucidity, periods of mania, periods
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1620.0s	1620.0	 of paranoia, periods of anger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1625.9s	1625.9	 And so that's all I saw when I was watching this thing is just what a lot of people in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1631.3s	1631.3	 the United States deal and the world deal with when they have relatives who are suffering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1636.7s	1636.7	 from one of these things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1638.2s	1638.2	 And, you know, my relative has said the same thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1641.0s	1641.0	 There's nothing wrong with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1642.6s	1642.6	 You know, I don't need medication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1644.2s	1644.2	 I'm not on these meds, blah, blah, blah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1646.1s	1646.1	 And I don't want to judge because I don't know him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1648.1s	1648.1	 But I'll tell you in my situation, trying to like, you know, for example, like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1653.8s	1653.8	 person thinks that, you know, myself and one other person, like we hacked into a computer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1660.5s	1660.5	 system of the place that they worked to manipulate the financial records to point to this person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1667.8s	1667.8	 as having committed a fraud and has, and then thinks that people are now listening and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1673.0s	1673.0	 bugging the phone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1673.8s	1673.8	 I mean, there's all kinds of stuff over and over again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1676.5s	1676.5	 And then sometimes they don't think that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1677.8s	1677.8	 And sometimes they do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1678.7s	1678.7	 And it's like, it's maddening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1680.3s	1680.3	 What I'm trying to tell you is like, when you're not when you're in a normal state,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1686.3s	1686.3	 regulated state, and you're talking to somebody who's dysregulated, it's not too normal people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1691.4s	1691.4	 having a conversation where you're trying to get them to see the logic of your ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1696.1s	1696.1	 So again, I just think that it's not it's not a thing that should be litigated in the media.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1700.3s	1700.3	 I think it is a thing that is where people that care for this person need to surround them and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1706.1s	1706.1	 get them with a doctor to help them rebalance in the case of our family.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1712.6s	1712.6	 What it turns out is that this person needs to constantly be re titrated the drugs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1718.1s	1718.1	 for them to be regulated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1720.5s	1720.5	 That may be different for other people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1721.8s	1721.8	 And I don't know Kanye situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1723.8s	1723.8	 So anyways, I see all that and I and I and I go to my own family situation, which I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1729.9s	1729.9	 which we actively deal with today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1731.5s	1731.5	 And I don't have much of an idea of what to do about Kanye because it brings up too much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1735.7s	1735.7	 stuff about what I'm dealing with in real time with my own family.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1739.3s	1739.3	 I'm sorry you're going through that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1740.5s	1740.5	 And I Yeah, like I said, I mean, I think Lex had good intent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1744.4s	1744.4	 I don't think it's worth doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1746.6s	1746.6	 No, he's he's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1748.6s	1748.6	 You know, he's a really beautiful, empathetic person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1750.6s	1750.6	 Lex is in general.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1751.8s	1751.8	 Yeah, so I think he tried to do the best job he could.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1754.2s	1754.2	 So I saw I saw part of the Lex interview.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1756.9s	1756.9	 It was two and a half hours and I wasn't gonna sit through two and a half hours of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1759.7s	1759.7	 You know, I went to the I went to the chapter titles and I was in the middle is like Holocaust.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1765.2s	1765.2	 I was like, okay, let's just go right to the train wreck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1768.5s	1768.5	 Yeah, so I skipped it to there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1770.3s	1770.3	 But anyway, I think the argument that that Lex should have made or pointed out to Kanye is like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1775.4s	1775.4	 go see the new Elvis movie, which is all about how an artist basically got taken advantage of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1782.7s	1782.7	 by his business manager.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1785.2s	1785.2	 And you'll see that this idea is a very familiar trope in the music business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1791.3s	1791.3	 But that manager, Colonel Tom Parker, he wasn't Jewish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1795.0s	1795.0	 He was a Dutch con man pretending to be a southern hick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1798.4s	1798.4	 So this can happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1799.8s	1799.8	 And it's a very common story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1801.3s	1801.3	 It's got nothing to do with the religion or race or whatever of the business people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1808.2s	1808.2	 So and in fact, the person in that movie who has the best advice for Elvis is BB King,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1814.6s	1814.6	 who says to Elvis at a very early point in the movie says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1817.4s	1817.4	 if you don't do the business, the business will do you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1821.8s	1821.8	 And so look, I think Kanye, if again, if I was to sort of steel man and respond to it is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1827.6s	1827.6	 listen, you know, what you're describing is a pretty common
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1831.7s	1831.7	 of artists being taken advantage of is, is a common issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1834.4s	1834.4	 It goes back a long time and it's got nothing to do with religion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1837.6s	1837.6	 And quite frankly, you know, there's probably a lot of other Jews in your life who've helped you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1842.5s	1842.5	 I mean, I wonder the last time you went to a doctor, did you notice whether they were Jewish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1846.9s	1846.9	 or not, you know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1847.8s	1847.8	 And so he's developed a little bit of a fixation here of noticing that some people are Jewish,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1854.3s	1854.3	 but probably he's not noticing when other people are Jewish, you've probably helped him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1858.4s	1858.4	 So that's probably like the argument I would have made with him,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1862.4s	1862.4	 you know, if I were conducting that interview.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1864.5s	1864.5	 And you make the argument to a person who's in a manic episode and they don't even realize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1870.4s	1870.4	 what they're saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1871.0s	1871.0	 They forget what they say when they get through the manic episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1873.8s	1873.8	 These paranoias don't tend to come up when you're in a regulated normal state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1878.2s	1878.2	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1878.9s	1878.9	 All right, let's talk about meta.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1881.0s	1881.0	 Brad Gerson was on last week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1882.6s	1882.6	 We've had an ongoing discussion about big tech entitlement, spending,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1886.2s	1886.2	 the number of employees at these companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1888.6s	1888.6	 On Monday, Brad, I think, you know, got a little worked up on the last pod, maybe,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1893.1s	1893.1	 and dropped an open letter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1895.0s	1895.0	 Some might say activist, he would say constructivist to Zuckerberg and the team over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1900.7s	1900.7	 Hey, maybe pump the brakes on the catbacks, maybe do a riff, maybe become profitable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1906.3s	1906.3	 Anyway, the revenue and the third quarter was a complete utter disaster for meta.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1914.7s	1914.7	 And the stock has plummeted and been under $100 a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1920.4s	1920.4	 I don't know who wants to start on this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1922.0s	1922.0	 But okay, look, there's a lot to unpack here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1923.9s	1923.9	 So I think I think we should take our time because I think one part of it is meta.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1929.0s	1929.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1929.8s	1929.8	 But one part of it is actually about what we talked about a few episodes ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1934.0s	1934.0	 which is like this big tech put right where they define the rules of the game on the field
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1941.0s	1941.0	 for every other startup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1943.0s	1943.0	 And I think the third part is just about like the era of big tech being over and what it means
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1947.8s	1947.8	 for the stock market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1949.1s	1949.1	 I think if you section it out in those three ways, Jason, we can have a pretty rich convo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1953.6s	1953.6	 I'd love to tease some of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1955.2s	1955.2	 Where do you want to start?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1956.2s	1956.2	 Okay, so let's let's start with meta.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1957.9s	1957.9	 So Nick, can you please throw up Apple versus meta for a second?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1962.3s	1962.3	 And let me just give you guys the the talk track and then maybe we can go from there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1966.9s	1966.9	 So when you look at Apple versus meta, there's this really interesting thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1972.4s	1972.4	 that comes up, which is in 2016, you know, and we've said this before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1977.8s	1977.8	 you could not give Apple stock away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1980.6s	1980.6	 They were generating a ton of cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1982.6s	1982.6	 It was sitting on the balance sheet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1984.5s	1984.5	 In many ways, Facebook was doing the same thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1987.2s	1987.2	 And there was this famous dinner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1988.6s	1988.6	 I don't know if it was a dinner that ever happened, but that's how the the lore is told
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1993.6s	1993.6	 between Tim Cook, Carl Icahn, and I think Luca Maestri, the CFO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=1998.6s	1998.6	 And in it, what Carl Icahn said is, listen, I have a below the line suggestion for Apple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2006.8s	2006.8	 And what does that mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2007.5s	2007.5	 If you look at a P&L, you have your revenues, that's above the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2011.6s	2011.6	 You have costs, that's also above the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2014.5s	2014.5	 And then you have your profits, and then it's what you do with the profits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2017.9s	2017.9	 So what he was suggesting is below the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2020.6s	2020.6	 After the fact, he had no suggestions for how the business should be run.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2024.8s	2024.8	 He just said, give us back the money and we will reward you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2028.6s	2028.6	 The stock price will go up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2030.7s	2030.7	 And what's interesting to note here is the black line is the performance of Apple stock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2035.5s	2035.5	 as as they've given back and they've used a ton of their own balance sheet cash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2041.3s	2041.3	 to buy back the stock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2042.8s	2042.8	 Okay, so they've spent $396 billion since 2016 to buy back stock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2050.2s	2050.2	 In the same time, Facebook has spent almost 100 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2054.2s	2054.2	 Now, here is here's where you start to see the divergence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2057.8s	2057.8	 So you would have said, well, shouldn't Facebook's stock have reacted in the same way?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2063.1s	2063.1	 And for a very long time, it actually looked like it was right until about September 21.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2069.0s	2069.0	 And then obviously, this thing fell off a cliff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2072.8s	2072.8	 And the reason why it started to fall off a cliff was somebody started to notice that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2077.3s	2077.3	 hold on a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2079.2s	2079.2	 Even though you're buying back all these shares, the bottom of the funnel, right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2083.8s	2083.8	 you're leaking all of these shares to all of these new employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2087.4s	2087.4	 Why are you hiring so many people?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2090.0s	2090.0	 And this is when people started to uncover what was happening above the line at Facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2095.2s	2095.2	 and is what caused this massive dispersion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2097.5s	2097.5	 So, Nick, if you go to the first chart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2099.8s	2099.8	 So what has actually been going on above the line?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2104.6s	2104.6	 Here's what's going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2106.7s	2106.7	 If you look at the light purple bar, Facebook in the last two years have spent $25 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2112.5s	2112.5	 on reality dabs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2114.6s	2114.6	 And they said that they're going to spend, you know, meaningfully more in 2023,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2119.0s	2119.0	 and then sustain that investment for a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2121.8s	2121.8	 So if you do a little bit of math, if they spent, you know, they spend around $4 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2125.6s	2125.6	 a quarter right now, so 16 billion a year, that'll go to 25 billion in 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2131.0s	2131.0	 And then they'll sustain that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2132.7s	2132.7	 What that means is that over this, you know, 12 or 13 year life of reality labs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2137.5s	2137.5	 as we've seen it, these guys will have spent a quarter of a trillion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2143.0s	2143.0	 And what I did here was I just wanted to understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2145.6s	2145.6	 Hilarious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2146.5s	2146.5	 I wanted to understand a quarter of a trillion dollars in the context of other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2150.5s	2150.5	 major leaps in humanity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2152.6s	2152.6	 So at the left is what Apple spent in its entirety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2155.8s	2155.8	 By the way, these are all inflation adjusted dollars for today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2159.4s	2159.4	 Apple spent $3.6 billion to create the first iPhone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2164.2s	2164.2	 And what they did was they said every subsequent version of the iPhone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2168.8s	2168.8	 would only be funded from the cash flow and profits of the generation before it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2174.2s	2174.2	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2174.4s	2174.4	 So they used consumer demand as their guiding principle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2178.2s	2178.2	 So it was a very incremental approach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2179.8s	2179.8	 iPhone one, iPhone two, and now we're at iPhone, you know, 14 or whatever 13.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2184.8s	2184.8	 But the point is it took 3.6 billion to get that juggernaut off the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2190.8s	2190.8	 The Manhattan project will cost 23 billion in today's dollars to create the atomic bomb.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2196.9s	2196.9	 Tesla in its entire life spent 25 billion to get to free cash flow profitability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2202.1s	2202.1	 And they took this incremental approach as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2205.0s	2205.0	 Will create the, you know, the, the coop, the roadster, then the model S, then the model X.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2211.5s	2211.5	 They iterated their way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2213.4s	2213.4	 They used customer demand and all of that revenue to fund future growth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2217.8s	2217.8	 The CUME spend on Tesla was 25 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2221.0s	2221.0	 Boeing spent 32.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2222.6s	2222.6	 Google and other bets has spent 40.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2225.0s	2225.0	 The only thing that I could find in history that is comparable to what Metta has basically said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2230.6s	2230.6	 they're going to spend is the entire Apollo program, which costs in today's dollars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2235.4s	2235.4	 a quarter of a trillion as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2237.0s	2237.0	 So the problem is that below the line, Metta was doing the right things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2242.6s	2242.6	 Above the line, they've created, I think, an enormous set of pressures for themselves,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2248.1s	2248.1	 which is, you know, if you think about the Apollo program, this was 13 years of building rockets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2253.9s	2253.9	 getting to low earth orbit, then getting to be able to orbit the earth, then eventually building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2259.0s	2259.0	 an entire infrastructure and capability to land on the moon and get back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2263.0s	2263.0	 So there was a lot of incremental progress there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2265.0s	2265.0	 I think what people don't understand is where is this quarter of a trillion dollars going?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2269.0s	2269.0	 And is it going to be a leap in humanity at the scale of the Apollo program?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2274.7s	2274.7	 Because it now is becoming the single largest capital allocation program in capitalism history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2284.1s	2284.1	 Nothing comes close.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2285.8s	2285.8	 So I think that that is a really interesting maybe jumping off point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2290.2s	2290.2	 to talk about what's going on inside of this business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2293.0s	2293.0	 I think they're doing all the right things below the line,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2295.7s	2295.7	 but there's this one major big red flag above the line that has to be probably better explained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2301.0s	2301.0	 by them if they want to have long term shareholders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2303.8s	2303.8	 And basically what happened was when people heard this, they said, this is a dumpster fire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2307.2s	2307.2	 We're out of here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2308.2s	2308.2	 Sax, what do you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2309.0s	2309.0	 Can I ask a question?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2309.7s	2309.7	 What happened with the whole Brad Gerstner proposal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2312.7s	2312.7	 Was that actually discussed on the call?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2315.4s	2315.4	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2315.6s	2315.6	 On the earnings call?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2316.2s	2316.2	 They, you know, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2318.3s	2318.3	 Ignored.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2318.9s	2318.9	 Well, I don't want to say it was totally ignored
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2322.1s	2322.1	 because I do think that they should be given credit for a couple of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2326.4s	2326.4	 I think that the core business continues to march forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2330.3s	2330.3	 And they basically said, look, we're going to slow headcount growth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2334.2s	2334.2	 Some teams will shrink.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2336.0s	2336.0	 I think the problem is really in this reality labs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2339.7s	2339.7	 The amount of investment that they're making is so outsized and so abnormal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2345.1s	2345.1	 And doesn't compare to anything anybody's ever seen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2348.5s	2348.5	 I think everything else in the business seems to be actually quite functional.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2353.4s	2353.4	 So the problem is that this above the line thing though has become so big.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2358.7s	2358.7	 It could sink the business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2360.3s	2360.3	 You know, it's very, very hard to see an investment case for a quarter of a trillion dollars of money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2366.5s	2366.5	 in the door before you really start to see something magical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2369.1s	2369.1	 Now they may have something super magical that nobody knows about that they're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2373.6s	2373.6	 to unveil and say, ha, see told you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2376.3s	2376.3	 And maybe there should be a set of outcomes where we plan for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2380.1s	2380.1	 But the reality is it's, you know, $25 billion a year for the next umpteen years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2385.8s	2385.8	 And it's, it's, and I think 10 billion, where did the 25 billion come from?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2389.9s	2389.9	 No, it's 4 billion a quarter right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2392.6s	2392.6	 So 16 billion a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2394.3s	2394.3	 And they said that they're going to significantly increase it to 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2397.7s	2397.7	 So I just assumed it was a 50% increase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2400.0s	2400.0	 Maybe significant means 100.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2402.0s	2402.0	 But 16 goes to 25 and they said they're going to keep going at that pace.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2406.3s	2406.3	 And so if you run that out till 2030, that's how you get to $250 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2411.2s	2411.2	 You think there's a business here in VR, AR, sex?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2414.6s	2414.6	 You think this will be the next platform?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2416.0s	2416.0	 I guess that's a key question to ask here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2418.2s	2418.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2418.5s	2418.5	 I mean, I, I like, I actually like these Oculus products.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2421.5s	2421.5	 I think it's a very cool product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2425.3s	2425.3	 The question is really just about the magnitude of the investment level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2428.3s	2428.3	 But I think there is a future in VR and AR and it is a, you've tried the Oculus headset before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2436.6s	2436.6	 It is like a very magical, you know, experience with software.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2443.1s	2443.1	 One of the most magical that I've had.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2445.0s	2445.0	 The question is just, we're talking about magnitude and timeframe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2449.2s	2449.2	 And use case, I think also comes to mind for me, Sachs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2452.4s	2452.4	 Everybody seems to, you know, try and then say, oh my,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2456.7s	2456.7	 and then say goodbye to these headsets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2458.2s	2458.2	 Like people buy them, they try them and they're like, this is incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2461.4s	2461.4	 But there's no use case for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2462.9s	2462.9	 I see very few people who use them on a regular basis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2465.8s	2465.8	 We just invested in a company that is creating professional flight simulators using VR as a component.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2474.3s	2474.3	 Education.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2475.1s	2475.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2475.5s	2475.5	 I think training is actually a huge use case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2477.7s	2477.7	 Huge, huge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2479.0s	2479.0	 And by the way, these are not like video game flight simulator programs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2484.4s	2484.4	 These are actual, they create physical cockpits with knobs and dials and stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2489.7s	2489.7	 It's just that the pilot is using a professional grade VR headset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2495.0s	2495.0	 And so they're able to load, you know, a lot more training programs and scenarios
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2499.5s	2499.5	 and they're able to train on more planes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2502.1s	2502.1	 They can like change up the cockpit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2503.9s	2503.9	 By the way, the cockpit's on gyros.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2505.9s	2505.9	 So it actually moves around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2507.2s	2507.2	 Let me put a Dation in a different way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2509.0s	2509.0	 I think that we should assume that VR and AR is going to be a really important part
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2512.6s	2512.6	 of our existence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2514.5s	2514.5	 And I do think that, as David said, many of these experiences are magical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2518.6s	2518.6	 I think what investors reacted to was spending $25 billion a year needs to be measurable somehow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2526.5s	2526.5	 And I think what they said is the things that we're seeing don't necessarily tell us that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2531.0s	2531.0	 this bet is going to make any sense at that level of spend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2533.8s	2533.8	 So if you were spending $2 billion a year or $3 billion a year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2537.8s	2537.8	 I don't think people would have said anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2540.2s	2540.2	 It's just the magnitude relative to the progress that's being demonstrated publicly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2544.6s	2544.6	 And that's the thing that I think the Tesla program got right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2548.2s	2548.2	 The Apple phone program got right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2550.2s	2550.2	 The Boeing program, even the Apollo 13 program for that quantum of spend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2554.6s	2554.6	 So it's not to say that you can't spend a quarter trillion dollars over the next decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2558.6s	2558.6	 But you got to eat what you kill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2560.1s	2560.1	 You have to be able to show progress in a way that says, oh, this investment is tracking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2565.3s	2565.3	 Freeberg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2566.5s	2566.5	 I think the biggest issue he's having is he's trying to build a moonshot that you'll only get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2572.8s	2572.8	 to see when I'm done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2574.1s	2574.1	 It's like, hey, I'm behind the curtain over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2576.2s	2576.2	 I'm Willy Wonka.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2577.0s	2577.0	 I'm going to come out with the most amazing chocolate bar in 10 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2579.4s	2579.4	 And after I spend $100 billion, but don't worry, it's going to be awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2583.4s	2583.4	 Trust me, shareholders, it's going to be amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2585.7s	2585.7	 And with consumer products in particular, not guys, you keep saying 100.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2589.2s	2589.2	 It's 250.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2590.6s	2590.6	 Yeah, whatever it ends up being in general.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2593.6s	2593.6	 I think consumer products, you want to see them in the market and you want to iterate to success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2599.2s	2599.2	 Tell me one consumer product that launched and didn't iterate after launch and didn't kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2603.8s	2603.8	 evolve over time in a way that responded to what the market was telling the builder or that product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2608.9s	2608.9	 But Freeberg, in fairness to them, they're doing that too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2611.4s	2611.4	 It's just I think what people can't square is we see the next gen Oculus's and then we see the spend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2619.5s	2619.5	 and we think that they're upside down relative to what we're seeing in terms of progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2623.1s	2623.1	 I think that's what people are reacting to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2624.4s	2624.4	 If he was spending $5 billion a year, this wouldn't be an issue, Chamath, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2627.5s	2627.5	 A nothing burger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2628.7s	2628.7	 A nothing burger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2629.7s	2629.7	 People would say good idea, throw a long ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2632.6s	2632.6	 I think that there's two kind of ways to think about the distinct things that they're building.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2636.7s	2636.7	 One is this hardware platform with Oculus and a better kind of experience for immersive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2642.7s	2642.7	 experiences, whether that's VR or AR.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2645.4s	2645.4	 The second is what's all the software layer look like and what goes on in that platform?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2649.4s	2649.4	 That's where this thing seems to be pretty short and where people seem to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2653.2s	2653.2	 a lack of confidence and conviction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2655.2s	2655.2	 The hardware seems super interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2657.2s	2657.2	 But I got to tell you, Epic Games just raised money earlier this year at a $31 billion valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2662.8s	2662.8	 If Zuck was a smart guy, he would go to Tencent and cut him a check and buy the whole thing for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2666.4s	2666.4	 $50 billion and buy those guys because that's a platform that has a couple hundred million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2671.7s	2671.7	 active users.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2672.7s	2672.7	 Is making money has a really deep immersive but two-dimensional experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2678.1s	2678.1	 It's not 3D, it's not on VR.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2681.2s	2681.2	 On top of Fortnite and on top of their engine that they've built, there are just countless
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2687.6s	2687.6	 experiences and worlds and interactions and models that exist today that are already active,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2694.9s	2694.9	 that are being iterated, that have been evolving for years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2697.3s	2697.3	 If you look at where Fortnite and some of the tools and experiences that have been built into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2701.6s	2701.6	 Fortnite over the past couple of years sit relative to when Fortnite was first launched,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2706.3s	2706.3	 I don't think that Tim Sweeney and that team would have ever said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2709.3s	2709.3	 hey, this is where we're going to be in a couple of years, this is what we're going to be doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2712.1s	2712.1	 It was part of an evolutionary experience of building a great platform and having an engaged
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2716.5s	2716.5	 user base.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2717.4s	2717.4	 Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a great engaged user base in the software layer of what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2721.6s	2721.6	 he's built here today, making it very difficult to track a path to get consumer feedback and to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2727.0s	2727.0	 identify where that goes over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2728.9s	2728.9	 The hardware experience, totally understand that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2731.0s	2731.0	 That takes time to build something incredible, also should be in the market and getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2734.5s	2734.5	 iterative feedback, but really that software piece is what feels short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2738.6s	2738.6	 To your point, I think that that's another great example of a below the line decision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2743.0s	2743.0	 that they could have made with all of this money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2746.4s	2746.4	 If you compare what Brad asked Facebook to do on Monday versus what Icon asked Apple to do in 2016,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2753.3s	2753.3	 Icon basically said, just make this below the line change and everybody will be happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2757.8s	2757.8	 It's a do no harm solution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2759.4s	2759.4	 None of us are getting in the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2761.0s	2761.0	 We're not telling you how to run the business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2763.4s	2763.4	 The thing that I think that what Facebook had to react to was Brad's suggestions were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2767.2s	2767.2	 fundamentally above the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2768.4s	2768.4	 It's like firing 20% of the people or 30% or changing the capital allocation would require
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2773.9s	2773.9	 some changes to strategy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2775.7s	2775.7	 And I think this is a good moment to recognize that as much clarity as Brad's letter had and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2781.6s	2781.6	 as much sense as it probably makes to outsiders looking in, the minute you have to tell companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2786.6s	2786.6	 how to change above the line, it's just a good reminder to me that no, it's not going to happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2791.5s	2791.5	 because these folks will not want to make those changes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2794.2s	2794.2	 They don't want to make the changes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2796.5s	2796.5	 I think it's natural human psychology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2798.3s	2798.3	 I think you want to make those changes yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2800.2s	2800.2	 You don't want to be told what to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2802.5s	2802.5	 Got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2803.6s	2803.6	 Sax, what do you think this is going to do to governance in Silicon Valley writ large?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2807.6s	2807.6	 Probably nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2809.5s	2809.5	 Really?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2809.8s	2809.8	 So it's not going to change anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2811.4s	2811.4	 Well, it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2811.8s	2811.8	 It is interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2812.6s	2812.6	 If you look at Elon's Twitter deal, there is no dual class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2817.3s	2817.3	 Everybody has.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2819.2s	2819.2	 This is one class of security.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2821.6s	2821.6	 This is one type of stock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2823.5s	2823.5	 So it's simple majority voting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2825.9s	2825.9	 Elon actually had the choice of doing dual class and he decided not to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2831.1s	2831.1	 So that's pretty interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2833.0s	2833.0	 So if people want to follow Elon's example, then they would not necessarily go for dual class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2839.4s	2839.4	 Tesla doesn't have super shares either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2840.9s	2840.9	 And he said it many times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2841.8s	2841.8	 If you want to vote me out, you can vote me out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2843.8s	2843.8	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2844.0s	2844.0	 You don't think I'm doing a good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2846.0s	2846.0	 SpaceX, SpaceX either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2849.0s	2849.0	 Yeah, he's putting his neck on the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2851.0s	2851.0	 I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2851.4s	2851.4	 I has a SpaceX shoulder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2852.6s	2852.6	 I have no idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2853.2s	2853.2	 I don't know what SpaceX class structure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2854.9s	2854.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2855.3s	2855.3	 I can't remember.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2856.4s	2856.4	 SpaceX isn't public yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2857.8s	2857.8	 So maybe it doesn't matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2858.8s	2858.8	 Like they haven't reached that decision point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2861.1s	2861.1	 I will tell you, I just, I think Starlink has such a huge opportunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2865.4s	2865.4	 I just got Starlink for two locations as a backup because you lose your internet a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2871.7s	2871.7	 couple of times a year and you can get these routers now that'll fail over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2874.6s	2874.6	 So since I'm doing business, like I can't really lose the internet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2877.5s	2877.5	 So for a thousand bucks a year, I can have Starlink as a backup and I started using it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2882.1s	2882.1	 And the speed is getting pretty compelling already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2885.1s	2885.1	 Like Zoom calls, you can't tell the difference right now most of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2889.1s	2889.1	 And certainly for web browsing or watching a movie, you know, it just works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2894.4s	2894.4	 So I could see many companies putting in Starlink, even if they have a fiber line
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2898.4s	2898.4	 or whatever, just as a backup, that business alone could be ginormous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2902.6s	2902.6	 Just to provide both sides of the story here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2904.5s	2904.5	 I mean, the reason why dual class emerged and was seen as viable is that if you look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2910.5s	2910.5	 at the historic performance of internet companies, the ones that have done the best,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2915.3s	2915.3	 performed the best are the ones where the founder stays involved for a long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2919.1s	2919.1	 And the ones where the founder checked out, like after a few years and hired a professional CEO,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2924.3s	2924.3	 those are the ones that went off the rails.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2925.7s	2925.7	 It happened again and again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2927.3s	2927.3	 So there is an argument for dual class in the sense that you keep the founder involved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2932.2s	2932.2	 and you avoid a power struggle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2935.9s	2935.9	 That's not what happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2937.7s	2937.7	 Well, but that was why it was considered acceptable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2940.1s	2940.1	 Well, I think it was considered acceptable because in the Google bake off, all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2943.7s	2943.7	 banks were clamoring so hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2945.8s	2945.8	 And, you know, there were two vectors of iteration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2948.3s	2948.3	 One vector was on the way that, you know, Google wanted to do this IPO process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2953.0s	2953.0	 They pick credit suites.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2953.9s	2953.9	 They did this Dutch auction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2955.0s	2955.0	 The other one was the bankers basically pitched them on a dual class voting control structure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2959.3s	2959.3	 And once Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2961.1s	2961.1	 And once Google got it, everybody else was able to copy because all the bankers realized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2965.9s	2965.9	 that if you want to win a bake off, you're not trying to win over the CFO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2970.1s	2970.1	 You're actually trying to win over the CEO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2972.2s	2972.2	 And giving that person control turned out to be an incredible commitment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2976.1s	2976.1	 and a way to win the deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2977.5s	2977.5	 And so I actually think it was never a governance issue or a reflection of how value was created.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2983.6s	2983.6	 It was just basically a feature that you that one banker used in an IPO bake off to try to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2989.3s	2989.3	 differentiate versus another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2990.5s	2990.5	 This is why, you know, like I said, like Elon has never cared about that stuff because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2994.2s	2994.2	 it's like, if I'm not doing well, vote me out, which is so clarifying because he realizes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=2998.5s	2998.5	 that that's actually the best check on him making bad decisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3002.6s	3002.6	 You know, and I think part of it is why he's done so well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3005.5s	3005.5	 You know, one class of stock, he was able to negotiate an incredible compensation package
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3009.9s	3009.9	 and it's he's he has clarity on the few things of the business that matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3014.8s	3014.8	 But I think he's also more compelling than some of these other guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3018.1s	3018.1	 And there may be some degree of feeling like this is a mechanism that other people need,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3023.0s	3023.0	 that Elon has a degree of confidence and a degree of charisma and salesmanship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3027.7s	3027.7	 that gets him what he wants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3029.4s	3029.4	 I just want to read you guys the excerpt from Larry and Sergey's founder's letter from the IPO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3033.7s	3033.7	 in 2004.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3034.9s	3034.9	 As a private company, we've concentrated on the long term and this has served as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3038.6s	3038.6	 As a public company, we will do the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3040.6s	3040.6	 In our opinion, outside pressures too often tempt companies to sacrifice long term
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3045.8s	3045.8	 opportunities to meet quarterly market expectations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3049.0s	3049.0	 Sometimes this has caused opportunities to manipulate financial results in order to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3053.4s	3053.4	 make their quarter and they go on and on and on and they say, look, you might ask us how long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3058.0s	3058.0	 is long term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3058.7s	3058.7	 Usually we expect them in a couple of years and they go on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3061.8s	3061.8	 Many companies are under pressure to keep their earnings in line with analyst forecasts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3065.9s	3065.9	 Therefore, they often accept smaller, predictable earnings rather than larger and less
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3070.5s	3070.5	 predictable returns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3071.8s	3071.8	 Sergey and I feel this is harmful and we intend to steer in the opposite direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3076.6s	3076.6	 I think that the statement that they made really resonated in Silicon Valley at the time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3080.7s	3080.7	 particularly during this era of what people were calling Web 2 and the internet was being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3084.5s	3084.5	 rebuilt and all these businesses were starting to thrive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3087.8s	3087.8	 And it was like we have this massive road ahead of us, this long road ahead of us, and we can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3091.6s	3091.6	 really change the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3092.8s	3092.8	 But in order to do it well, in order to do it effectively, we have to as entrepreneurs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3097.5s	3097.5	 as engineers be able to have the freedom to operate for the long term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3101.8s	3101.8	 I don't think it had anything to get stuck in the short term, but I think that that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3105.9s	3105.9	 had nothing to do with anything that there was no pressure on them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3109.4s	3109.4	 It's not like they shied away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3111.1s	3111.1	 It's not like that super voting control allowed them to make one seminal decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3114.8s	3114.8	 There were quarters, Chamath, where Google was getting a lot of heat for the amount of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3118.2s	3118.2	 money they were spending on CapEx because they were building their own data centers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3120.8s	3120.8	 They were building their own servers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3122.7s	3122.7	 They were building their own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3124.2s	3124.2	 Eventually, DRAM.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3125.3s	3125.3	 They started to build their own switches.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3127.1s	3127.1	 Every element of how Google built a competitive advantage over time was difficult for analysts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3131.9s	3131.9	 to understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3132.5s	3132.5	 You're not saying that you're not saying the obvious thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3135.6s	3135.6	 The reason why they were allowed to do it in the end was because more and more users
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3140.0s	3140.0	 used their product because it was better and better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3142.7s	3142.7	 And they consistently meet and beat every expectation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3146.4s	3146.4	 They literally didn't need to use this option.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3148.7s	3148.7	 This was not it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3149.7s	3149.7	 You need to call this option.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3150.8s	3150.8	 This is not a company that went back and forth between meeting and missing expectations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3155.5s	3155.5	 OK, they were.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3156.7s	3156.7	 Up and to the right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3158.2s	3158.2	 They were.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3158.6s	3158.6	 They were up and to the right is correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3160.0s	3160.0	 That is the general principle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3161.4s	3161.4	 But the time to return the ROIC, the time frame to hit their ROIC targets was long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3167.0s	3167.0	 And it was hard for people to get that when they bought YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3169.1s	3169.1	 True.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3169.8s	3169.8	 That is not YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3172.1s	3172.1	 And they spent tens of billions of dollars investing in YouTube before it generated cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3176.6s	3176.6	 I get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3177.1s	3177.1	 I think that that would.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3177.8s	3177.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3178.0s	3178.0	 But you're not math.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3179.0s	3179.0	 You're not what you're saying is not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3181.0s	3181.0	 It is not mathematically true what you're saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3182.7s	3182.7	 There was no 13 year ROIC play that they executed on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3186.7s	3186.7	 Not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3188.6s	3188.6	 And you can just look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3189.4s	3189.4	 I disagree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3189.8s	3189.8	 They may have had challenges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3191.2s	3191.2	 They put their own fiber optic lines across the oceans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3194.2s	3194.2	 The CAPEX at Google was often scrutinized and not well understood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3198.1s	3198.1	 I get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3198.6s	3198.6	 You can read.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3199.4s	3199.4	 But Chamath, you can read the analyst reports and see how difficult this was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3202.4s	3202.4	 All I'm asking for you to do is look at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3204.0s	3204.0	 They had voting shares is what gave them the ability to do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3207.0s	3207.0	 Bullshit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3207.6s	3207.6	 I think that if you look at their performance, their EBITDA margins and their ROIC was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3211.9s	3211.9	 exceptional when they were making those investments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3213.9s	3213.9	 In fact, I would say the opposite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3215.7s	3215.7	 I would say that they were surprised by how high quality their business model was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3221.7s	3221.7	 They were generating so much cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3223.8s	3223.8	 What they were probably thinking back in the day was, oh my gosh, we need to make sure that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3228.6s	3228.6	 are actually making long term investments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3230.2s	3230.2	 And now we have the ability to do it because we have all this cash we didn't expect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3234.5s	3234.5	 And we should probably bleed off cash so that we don't show 50% gross margins to raise all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3239.8s	3239.8	 of the attention of regulators and everybody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3242.8s	3242.8	 And so what do you think Zuck is doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3244.3s	3244.3	 What's different today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3246.4s	3246.4	 I think that they have an incredible core business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3248.9s	3248.9	 Because he's got good business, good EBITDA margins, good revenue growth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3252.6s	3252.6	 What's different?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3253.4s	3253.4	 They have an incredible core business and they have decided for whatever reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3259.5s	3259.5	 to make an enormous bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3261.4s	3261.4	 And that bet could be a very good bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3265.0s	3265.0	 But the way that you make a bet and you said this well is you have to look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3268.7s	3268.7	 incremental progress and you have to demonstrate that all of these bets make sense because the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3275.0s	3275.0	 problem is when you get compared to the Tesla program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3279.7s	3279.7	 Look, Tesla is reinventing an entire category, trillions of dollars of energy generation and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3285.8s	3285.8	 transportation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3287.3s	3287.3	 But they did it on in one year of meta reality lab spend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3292.0s	3292.0	 Apple reinvented an entire compute platform on one quarter of Meta's reality lab spend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3300.0s	3300.0	 That's not a judgment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3301.0s	3301.0	 That's just a numerical observation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3303.4s	3303.4	 So if you want to get people on your side, you just have to be able to double click into that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3309.4s	3309.4	 in an elegant, articulate way and say here are all of these things that justify $25 billion a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3317.2s	3317.2	 Hey guys, let me show you a chart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3318.9s	3318.9	 Here's a chart of Alphabet's capital expenditures by quarter and here is their revenue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3326.2s	3326.2	 The blue line at $7 billion right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3329.0s	3329.0	 This is my point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3330.2s	3330.2	 Yeah, they struggled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3332.6s	3332.6	 They struggled to find ways to spend money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3336.2s	3336.2	 I mean, literally they created project loon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3339.0s	3339.0	 They were going to do balloons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3340.2s	3340.2	 Guys, they wanted to build.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3341.8s	3341.8	 They wanted to build.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3343.0s	3343.0	 They wanted to build.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3343.9s	3343.9	 They wanted to build at one point a ladder to the moon, a ladder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3347.9s	3347.9	 They thought they could build.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3348.8s	3348.8	 It was an elevator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3351.2s	3351.2	 Whatever, an elevator is in that seven point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3353.0s	3353.0	 You were going to have to climb there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3354.1s	3354.1	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3354.5s	3354.5	 The elevator was in the purple line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3357.2s	3357.2	 And somewhere in there they spent a billion or whatever on maps and it ended up being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3361.1s	3361.1	 a phenomenal asset when the whole world moved to mobile.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3363.4s	3363.4	 I think we're not saying the obvious thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3365.4s	3365.4	 We spent a lot less than a billion on that too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3367.8s	3367.8	 We're not saying the obvious thing, which is great leaps of progress in humanity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3372.1s	3372.1	 are not correlated to dollars all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3374.5s	3374.5	 In fact, most examples are the exact opposite, which is it's more about small and extremely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3380.8s	3380.8	 nimble and talented management teams that generate human progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3384.8s	3384.8	 And again, if you go back to that first chart of Apple versus Metta,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3389.1s	3389.1	 the fact that you've hired so many people to work on a category with so much money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3393.4s	3393.4	 it just violates a lot of pattern recognition that people have historically seen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3399.4s	3399.4	 So all I'm saying is maybe this is a great bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3402.6s	3402.6	 They just need to do a better job of explaining.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3404.6s	3404.6	 This would have been so much easier if he had just put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3406.7s	3406.7	 Charles Sandberg in total.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3409.0s	3409.0	 I'm saying this could be, this could have been such a better transition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3411.8s	3411.8	 He should have put Charles Sandberg, a CEO of the Facebook corporation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3415.4s	3415.4	 He should have became CEO of Metta and then he should have ran that other business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3419.7s	3419.7	 to print even more profits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3421.3s	3421.3	 And then if you look at some of their forays into building a super app,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3425.2s	3425.2	 they added Facebook marketplace to Facebook and it was a huge hit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3429.1s	3429.1	 They started to pull the e-commerce string over at Instagram.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3431.9s	3431.9	 It started to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3433.1s	3433.1	 There's just no focus on those products.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3435.2s	3435.2	 If you look at the Facebook collection of billions of users, what apps could you add to that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3440.8s	3440.8	 Whether it's payments, they did the whole crypto thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3442.7s	3442.7	 They gave up on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3443.6s	3443.6	 It seems like there's no leadership on the Facebook side that actually wants to take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3448.8s	3448.8	 swings over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3450.2s	3450.2	 They just are obsessed with this one thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3451.8s	3451.8	 It makes no sense to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3452.6s	3452.6	 I think that there's probably part of it, which is that when you're working on a thing for a long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3458.6s	3458.6	 time, there's a certain personality type that loves the mastery that comes from working on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3463.4s	3463.4	 the thing for a long, long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3465.2s	3465.2	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3465.7s	3465.7	 And then there's a different personality type that likes more shiny new things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3469.7s	3469.7	 And you kind of have to have a balance of all of those different people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3474.6s	3474.6	 And so maybe what we're seeing as well is that, you know, you're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3477.8s	3477.8	 Maybe the boring business was just labeled too boring internally and there wasn't enough heat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3482.5s	3482.5	 around wanting to work on it forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3484.0s	3484.0	 Nobody wanted to keep grinding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3485.1s	3485.1	 So you wanted to throw these big Hail Marys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3487.4s	3487.4	 All I'm saying is you just need to explain the Hail Mary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3490.0s	3490.0	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3491.0s	3491.0	 By the way, let me just ping you on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3492.6s	3492.6	 So the meta spend in the quarter relative to the revenue, it's about 15 or the virtual reality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3499.3s	3499.3	 stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3499.4s	3499.4	 It's about 15 billion, 15%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3501.2s	3501.2	 Does that sound right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3502.4s	3502.4	 I don't know, but they said it was 4 billion this quarter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3504.7s	3504.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3505.0s	3505.0	 So 4 billion out of 27 of revenue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3507.4s	3507.4	 So it's about 15% and Alphabet's last quarter revenue was 70 billion and they spent about a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3514.7s	3514.7	 billion billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3515.7s	3515.7	 Let me show you this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3516.8s	3516.8	 I actually had this chart handy because I was talking about it on this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3519.9s	3519.9	 Which is 1.4%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3521.6s	3521.6	 So on a relative basis, Alphabet is spending one 10th of what Meta is per dollar earned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3528.2s	3528.2	 or top line revenue earned on their other bets category.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3532.2s	3532.2	 So Chamath, do you think it's a relative spend problem that because they're spending 10 times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3537.9s	3537.9	 as much as a percent of revenue that it's causing so much heartache, even if it is directionally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3542.2s	3542.2	 correct?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3542.8s	3542.8	 If you want to see the CapEx versus revenue, here's that on the screen right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3546.6s	3546.6	 Yeah, no, we know what we haven't shown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3548.8s	3548.8	 This is Google and Meta on the same chart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3551.6s	3551.6	 The blue line on the red on the bottom, 9 billion in CapEx for Facebook, 7 billion for Google.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3557.5s	3557.5	 Is this your new charting tool that you guys built?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3560.2s	3560.2	 Yeah, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3560.7s	3560.7	 We just do charts on the floor?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3561.3s	3561.3	 I've been doing it on this week in startups all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3563.8s	3563.8	 What do you use?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3564.9s	3564.9	 What is this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3565.4s	3565.4	 It's actually beep it out because I don't want to give them a free sponsor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3569.4s	3569.4	 Yeah, I...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3569.8s	3569.8	 Beep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3571.4s	3571.4	 I'm not giving them a free promo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3572.8s	3572.8	 Oh, they didn't let you invest?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3574.7s	3574.7	 Whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3575.2s	3575.2	 I mean, they wanted to sponsor, man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3577.0s	3577.0	 The truth comes out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3577.8s	3577.8	 They didn't let them invest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3579.4s	3579.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3579.5s	3579.5	 No, no, they've been around forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3580.6s	3580.6	 They've been around forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3581.3s	3581.3	 Oh, okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3581.8s	3581.8	 I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3581.9s	3581.9	 It's a good product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3582.7s	3582.7	 I've used it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3583.2s	3583.2	 Yeah, just a beep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3583.9s	3583.9	 It's a good product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3584.7s	3584.7	 Listen, if we're going to promo something, it's going to be call in or...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3587.0s	3587.0	 Nick, can you throw up the histogram for a second?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3588.4s	3588.4	 SuperGut.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3590.4s	3590.4	 This is SuperGut charts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3591.8s	3591.8	 So look, this is the new charting feature on call in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3593.9s	3593.9	 I think the problem is, look, here's the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3596.0s	3596.0	 Let's just say that you're an analyst that works at a large hedge fund or a mutual fund.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3600.6s	3600.6	 And you woke up on Wednesday and you had a decent day and then you went into the earnings call
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3606.2s	3606.2	 believing that there's a value play here and there's a lot of upside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3610.0s	3610.0	 which I think there is actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3612.2s	3612.2	 This company can throw off an enormous amount of cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3616.6s	3616.6	 But then what you hear is, okay, we're spending $4 billion a quarter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3621.3s	3621.3	 That's going to go up materially.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3623.0s	3623.0	 And then we're going to keep 23 spending levels, roughly the same in the, to the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3627.8s	3627.8	 So then you have to go back and build a model.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3630.2s	3630.2	 You're going to be hard pressed to not get to this number.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3632.5s	3632.5	 Maybe you don't get to 250.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3633.7s	3633.7	 Maybe you get to 200.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3635.1s	3635.1	 My point is all of a sudden you have to go back into your portfolio manager and say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3642.2s	3642.2	 they're going to spend all of this after-tax cashflow on this stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3646.9s	3646.9	 Or sorry, not after-tax cashflow, but below the, above the line spending on this stuff,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3651.2s	3651.2	 which won't come back to us as shareholders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3653.6s	3653.6	 And we're going to dilute the stock two or 3% a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3655.8s	3655.8	 So that's another 20% dilution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3657.6s	3657.6	 And it just becomes what I, again, I've said this before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3661.3s	3661.3	 You move the stock into what's called the too hard bucket,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3665.0s	3665.0	 from the it's obvious to wow, that's really tough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3667.6s	3667.6	 And I'll just take a wait and see approach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3670.3s	3670.3	 I think yesterday there was a quarter of a,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3674.3s	3674.3	 I think a quarter billion shares that traded hands of Facebook, just a ginormous number.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3681.9s	3681.9	 And so, you know, I think it's-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3683.1s	3683.1	 You think that's tax loss harvesting too at the end of the year?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3685.2s	3685.2	 Maybe some people want to take the loss?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3686.6s	3686.6	 So there's tax loss harvesting for individuals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3688.4s	3688.4	 By the way, there was a couple of comments,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3690.3s	3690.3	 which we should talk about and explain what tax loss harvesting is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3693.1s	3693.1	 But a bunch of these mutual funds year ends are actually October 31st.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3697.7s	3697.7	 So to your point, Jason, you know, the stock basically gets decimated 20,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3702.0s	3702.0	 you know, 25% in a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3704.6s	3704.6	 The T-rows and the fidelities are like, all right, book the tax loss and be done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3707.9s	3707.9	 And we'll, we'll relook at it next year, quote unquote next year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3710.9s	3710.9	 So, you know, if you put on the spread trade, so we talked about the spread trade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3714.4s	3714.4	 There was a big hedge fund manager that, you know, November 6th, right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3717.8s	3717.8	 when we were basically calling the top of the market and told people to sell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3722.3s	3722.3	 One of the trades that he put on, Nick, if you want to just throw it up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3724.8s	3724.8	 was this long Google short meta spread trade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3728.9s	3728.9	 He called to tell me that, you know, he closed it out yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3732.4s	3732.4	 This is how that trade did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3735.0s	3735.0	 So yeah, there was just a lot of folks that just kind of like went to the exits and said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3738.9s	3738.9	 you know what, we're kind of done for the short term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3742.3s	3742.3	 I just think that it's, it's a, it's a moment in time where those folks have to realize that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3749.4s	3749.4	 they just have to explain a little bit better how they want to spend the money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3753.3s	3753.3	 and show a little bit more incremental progress that justifies that level of spend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3756.7s	3756.7	 Otherwise people will be a little skeptical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3759.4s	3759.4	 They'll build their own histogram and it'll violate too many rules.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3763.7s	3763.7	 And so it goes into the too hard bucket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3766.2s	3766.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3766.8s	3766.8	 We got macro, we got Ukraine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3769.8s	3769.8	 I think you should talk about big tech because Amazon puked as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3774.1s	3774.1	 Jason, the, can you just throw out the big tech chart?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3776.6s	3776.6	 Cause I think like you guys should see this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3778.3s	3778.3	 Cause I think this is very important for Silicon Valley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3780.6s	3780.6	 Amazon reported their Q3 earnings yesterday, Thursday, total revenue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3784.4s	3784.4	 127 billion, a 15% year of a year, 5% a quarter of a quarter net income was 2.9 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3789.8s	3789.8	 And they're predicting they're, they're giving slower guidance going forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3793.8s	3793.8	 I mean, what's incredible on this chart is that, you know, when, when everybody talks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3797.4s	3797.4	 about being long, the S and P 500, it was always really a proxy for being long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3802.5s	3802.5	 Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3804.9s	3804.9	 And at the peak, you know, in May of this year, it was still, you know, 25 cents of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3809.8s	3809.8	 every single dollar of the S and P 500 were these five companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3814.2s	3814.2	 And, you know, we always said the market bottom will be when the generals quote unquote get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3818.4s	3818.4	 shot, you know, to borrow a phrase from Gavin Baker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3821.5s	3821.5	 And it looks like the generals have been shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3823.8s	3823.8	 And what's incredible is this week, every single one of those companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3827.3s	3827.3	 other than Apple really reported pretty crappy earnings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3830.6s	3830.6	 They got totally taken to the woodshed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3833.4s	3833.4	 The percentage of the of these companies as a percentage of the S and P is now, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3837.6s	3837.6	 off by 500 basis points, it's down to 20%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3840.6s	3840.6	 Yet the markets are ripping higher today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3844.3s	3844.3	 So I think it's kind of what we talked about three weeks ago, like the bottom is kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3848.4s	3848.4	 in for the short term, you know, so it's really exciting, actually, to see, I think this is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3852.6s	3852.6	 point where you have to now start to get pretty constructive about where things are going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3856.8s	3856.8	 Because if this stuff could not bring the market down, it's hard to see something other than an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3862.2s	3862.2	 exogenous event, probably some Russia, Ukraine event.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3867.0s	3867.0	 Really having a negative impact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3868.3s	3868.3	 So to me, I'm kind of like, I don't know, it seems like pretty bullish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3871.5s	3871.5	 Well, also GDP was 2.6%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3873.8s	3873.8	 So I mean, the this very weird conflicting data, we had two negative quarters of growth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3879.0s	3879.0	 we're in a recession, then we have the third quarter is up 2.6%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3882.3s	3882.3	 So remember, Jason, I said that we're gonna have a double dip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3886.5s	3886.5	 That was the most likely thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3887.8s	3887.8	 So we had this sort of mild technical recession based on nominal GDP growth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3894.9s	3894.9	 not being bad, but simply not quite keeping up with the inflation rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3899.5s	3899.5	 Now things are a little bit better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3901.2s	3901.2	 But I still think the huge recession is to come next year, because all the interest rate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3905.3s	3905.3	 increases we've seen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3906.6s	3906.6	 So the Fed is, you know, pedal to the metal on interest rate increases, just like they were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3911.8s	3911.8	 pedal to the metal on printing money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3913.8s	3913.8	 And so first, they you know, they were too loose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3916.6s	3916.6	 And now they're probably being too tight, too fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3918.4s	3918.4	 So I think we're headed for a huge recession next year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3921.0s	3921.0	 And I think you're seeing that in the softness of all these forecasts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3924.9s	3924.9	 Yeah, look at the look at the look at the mortgage rates right now, something like 7.1%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3931.3s	3931.3	 I'm worried.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3931.7s	3931.7	 It's crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3933.0s	3933.0	 They broke the backs of the housing market that the inventory and prices inventory shot up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3938.9s	3938.9	 Prices have shot up new mortgages have gone down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3942.5s	3942.5	 And you know, we talked about job openings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3944.6s	3944.6	 Here's the the Fred chart for job openings real quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3947.8s	3947.8	 You can see the the peak we were talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3949.8s	3949.8	 We were wondering if that would come plummeting down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3951.8s	3951.8	 Well, here it is, folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3953.4s	3953.4	 Yeah, plummeting down from 11 million, losing a million in a month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3957.3s	3957.3	 Yeah, job openings coming smashing down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3959.2s	3959.2	 There's the Fed fund rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3961.0s	3961.0	 You know, that's a pretty high ramp.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3962.7s	3962.7	 So you think double dip recession?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3964.9s	3964.9	 What do you think, Freberg, Chamath, in terms of what 2023 looks like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3969.1s	3969.1	 You're sort of saying Chamath, a bottom is forming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3971.2s	3971.2	 I kind of agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3973.0s	3973.0	 I think the stock market is going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3977.4s	3977.4	 Then they'll go back down because I think what David said is right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3980.0s	3980.0	 But for the short term, this thing is going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3983.0s	3983.0	 Short term up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3984.6s	3984.6	 We've generally been positioned for it to go up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3986.6s	3986.6	 And and at some point, we will reverse and position for it to go back down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3991.4s	3991.4	 But it's going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3992.4s	3992.4	 Sax, it seems like you took a week off from the All In podcast and people stop talking about Ukraine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3998.3s	3998.3	 You want to give us an update?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=3999.7s	3999.7	 I mean, obviously, the war is not over, but it does seem like it somehow has fallen out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4005.7s	4005.7	 of the public's consciousness a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4007.2s	4007.2	 I don't know if I go that far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4009.0s	4009.0	 There was the big event in the Ukraine war debate this week was that the House Progressive Caucus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4016.1s	4016.1	 put out a letter signed by 30 progressive members to merely suggest that while we continue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4024.2s	4024.2	 to fund Ukraine on a virtually unlimited basis, we also in parallel open up a diplomatic track
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4030.2s	4030.2	 with Russia to mitigate against the threat of us being drawn into the war and specifically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4036.5s	4036.5	 a nuclear war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4037.8s	4037.8	 And just that very, I'd say, anodyne letter, that very tepid sentiment, really, they weren't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4045.4s	4045.4	 questioning in any way the providing again of virtually unlimited support to Ukraine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4051.4s	4051.4	 that met with such a fierce reaction on social media and in the traditional media that I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4057.8s	4057.8	 all but one of the signatories recanted or walked back the letter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4063.0s	4063.0	 And kudos to Representative Rokana for not being one of the people who recanted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4069.0s	4069.0	 He sat tall and gave an interview on CNN and MSNBC saying, why has diplomacy become a dirty word?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4076.6s	4076.6	 I voted for every single appropriation to give aid and weapons to Ukraine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4080.4s	4080.4	 I'll continue to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4081.8s	4081.8	 But I don't see a problem with us maintaining diplomatic relations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4085.9s	4085.9	 We might need those to avoid an unwanted escalation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4089.4s	4089.4	 Well, and here we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4090.8s	4090.8	 Kudos to him for standing tall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4092.0s	4092.0	 But it's amazing to me that the Progressive Caucus, which used to be one of the groups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4097.7s	4097.7	 in Congress that questioned American involvement in foreign wars like the Iraq War, they basically,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4106.2s	4106.2	 they have moved off that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4107.9s	4107.9	 And they threw in the towel so quickly on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4110.3s	4110.3	 It was really kind of pathetic to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4112.8s	4112.8	 I mean, it really like this is back to Shakespeare, like politics makes for strange bedfellows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4117.4s	4117.4	 You find yourself aligned with the most left part of the Democratic Party in trying to just say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4123.4s	4123.4	 hey, maybe we should negotiate peace a little more firmly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4126.6s	4126.6	 I want us to pursue the right foreign policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4128.6s	4128.6	 And I don't really care which party has the right idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4131.2s	4131.2	 You said you would actually donate to anybody who is pushing for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4135.0s	4135.0	 So did you actually make any?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4137.4s	4137.4	 It just happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4138.2s	4138.2	 But I plan to donate to members of both parties who push for a correct foreign policy, which I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4145.3s	4145.3	 believe needs to be a little bit more restrained, a little bit more questioning of what is in it for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4151.8s	4151.8	 the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4152.8s	4152.8	 And we need to be careful about overextending ourselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4157.0s	4157.0	 And we need to ask what is in America's vital interests?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4159.6s	4159.6	 And listen, we can support.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4160.5s	4160.5	 Will AOC be coming to the, will AOC be doing a, oh, she's pro?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4165.7s	4165.7	 She recanted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4166.6s	4166.6	 So she's one of the ones that were can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4168.2s	4168.2	 What do you think happens in a situation like that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4170.2s	4170.2	 How do they get them to recant?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4171.4s	4171.4	 Yeah, like why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4172.2s	4172.2	 What is the point of recanting something that was so benign?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4175.5s	4175.5	 It's not totally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4177.1s	4177.1	 No, but what do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4178.5s	4178.5	 Like what's happening behind the scenes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4180.4s	4180.4	 Like, why are people so afraid to say that, you know, you can be in support of Ukraine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4185.4s	4185.4	 but also still try to find a resolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4187.0s	4187.0	 Why was that turned into such a scarlet letter?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4189.9s	4189.9	 It's a great point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4190.8s	4190.8	 And I think it just shows the heat right now on the issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4194.6s	4194.6	 Here's what I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4195.5s	4195.5	 Does it do that or does it just show the progressives as just kind of clown tones?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4199.5s	4199.5	 I mean, it's kind of sad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4201.0s	4201.0	 I mean, Jayapal, who was sort of the leader who put out the letter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4205.8s	4205.8	 threw her own staff under the bus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4208.0s	4208.0	 And I guess there was this snafu where the members all signed this letter in July and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4212.2s	4212.2	 held it for a few months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4213.6s	4213.6	 And then they put it out two weeks before the election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4215.4s	4215.4	 I can see why that timing didn't make sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4218.2s	4218.2	 I don't know why.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4219.6s	4219.6	 Like they released it now, not two months ago, not three weeks from now after the election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4224.6s	4224.6	 I can understand all those political considerations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4227.4s	4227.4	 But once you put the letter out, just stand by it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4230.4s	4230.4	 Don't throw your own staff under the bus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4232.2s	4232.2	 Because like you're saying, the letter was really a pretty anodyne statement of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4237.2s	4237.2	 hey, listen, do you think we can just have diplomacy on a parallel track at the same time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4241.4s	4241.4	 that we're arming Ukraine?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4243.1s	4243.1	 I just don't see the downside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4244.5s	4244.5	 But look, here's why I think they took so much heat is there's a lot of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4248.9s	4248.9	 on this issue who start with the end result of what they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4252.9s	4252.9	 And the end result that they want is that Putin and Russia leave Ukraine with their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4258.6s	4258.6	 tail tucked between their legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4260.3s	4260.3	 And they basically don't get one square inch of Ukraine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4263.4s	4263.4	 They believe that is the only acceptable moral outcome here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4268.0s	4268.0	 And they may be right about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4269.8s	4269.8	 But then what they're doing is they're kind of reverse engineering all the beliefs that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4274.3s	4274.3	 they have based on that outcome, that moral outcome they want to get to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4277.1s	4277.1	 So for example, for the longest time, you heard things like Putin is definitely bluffing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4282.6s	4282.6	 about using nuclear weapons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4284.4s	4284.4	 Well, how do they know that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4285.3s	4285.3	 They don't know that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4286.2s	4286.2	 They can't say that for sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4287.6s	4287.6	 But it's what they want to believe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4289.0s	4289.0	 Because if you believe that nuclear war is a possibility, you might not go all the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4295.5s	4295.5	 for that maximalist position of the only acceptable outcome here is Russia leaving with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4300.2s	4300.2	 its tail tucked between its legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4301.4s	4301.4	 And hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4302.0s	4302.0	 And I think the same thing is happening here with diplomacy is people who want a certain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4308.0s	4308.0	 result in the war are afraid that diplomacy might result in something less than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4313.8s	4313.8	 That's not a reason not to engage in diplomacy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4317.0s	4317.0	 And it's not a reason to deny the potential of this war to spin out of control potentially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4323.5s	4323.5	 into a nuclear war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4324.5s	4324.5	 What are your thoughts on that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4325.4s	4325.4	 Sax is like a walking thesaurus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4326.8s	4326.8	 So J. Cal, for you, I looked up anodyne and it means not likely to provoke dissent or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4331.6s	4331.6	 offense inoffensive, often deliberately so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4334.2s	4334.2	 Yeah, like it's like, oh, I know you were looking, you were looking at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4337.8s	4337.8	 screen like a confused little puppy when he said anodyne.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4341.0s	4341.0	 So I just want to listen, I got a thesaurus over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4343.5s	4343.5	 Also, I didn't know what it meant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4345.0s	4345.0	 So thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4347.6s	4347.6	 But seriously, what is the I want to know the fallout from two things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4351.1s	4351.1	 And then we're going to do a science corner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4354.2s	4354.2	 So number one, what is the I've been getting a lot of oat milk stands emailing me different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4359.8s	4359.8	 brands of oat milk have been emailing me this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4362.6s	4362.6	 Just give us an update, generally speaking on the alt milk milk crowd and your inbox
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4367.4s	4367.4	 tomorrow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4367.8s	4367.8	 They're trying to they're definitely trying to Brigadoon me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4370.0s	4370.0	 But what these people like, you know what's so funny about these folks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4374.7s	4374.7	 They have no judgment clearly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4378.4s	4378.4	 Because they can't even say, you know what, it actually tastes much crappier than these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4382.9s	4382.9	 alternatives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4383.5s	4383.5	 But I choose to for x, y, z reasons that I could respect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4387.1s	4387.1	 It's the oh my god, it's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4389.0s	4389.0	 And it tastes so much better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4390.6s	4390.6	 You know, look at my little mustache.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4392.9s	4392.9	 Disgusting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4393.5s	4393.5	 It doesn't foam properly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4394.9s	4394.9	 It tastes like dishwater.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4396.8s	4396.8	 And then sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4397.8s	4397.8	 Disgusting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4398.3s	4398.3	 This horrific illustration of you in the new republic I saw look like Dolly broke and they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4405.1s	4405.1	 use Dolly to make that illustration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4406.6s	4406.6	 No offense to the illustrator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4407.8s	4407.8	 I got paid 1000 bucks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4408.6s	4408.6	 Well, it was like, it was pre ozempic sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4411.6s	4411.6	 I thought it was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4412.7s	4412.7	 Yeah, that's the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4414.1s	4414.1	 If you're chubby sacks or chubby J Cal, it sucks when people base an illustration on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4418.8s	4418.8	 a previous one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4419.9s	4419.9	 But sacks looks like a deranged sociopath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4423.0s	4423.0	 I mean, you look like Alex Jones in a suit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4425.4s	4425.4	 Well, look, they got Elon and Peter up there too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4427.3s	4427.3	 It's such a stupid hit piece.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4429.0s	4429.0	 Elon looks like Hugh Grant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4431.1s	4431.1	 Peter Tio looks like he's rolling on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4433.4s	4433.4	 Freeberg's Molly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4436.1s	4436.1	 He's got Molly jaw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4437.1s	4437.1	 And also he's you show a lot of stubble, which you also don't have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4442.6s	4442.6	 But look how fat they make you look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4443.9s	4443.9	 Look at your chin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4444.5s	4444.5	 You look like Joe Helmuth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4446.9s	4446.9	 Jesus, my Lord.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4448.8s	4448.8	 But what I mean, what's going on in terms of the general reaction to the amount of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4453.1s	4453.1	 attention you're getting for political commentary now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4456.4s	4456.4	 Sacks David Sachs will be our next Secretary of State.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4459.0s	4459.0	 Well, no, I'm here for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4460.0s	4460.0	 I can't wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4460.7s	4460.7	 I'll go long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4461.4s	4461.4	 That David Sachs will be our Secretary of State within two or three presidents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4465.8s	4465.8	 I'll take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4466.8s	4466.8	 He's got to make a little more cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4468.2s	4468.2	 My views are so out of step with the foreign policy establishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4472.5s	4472.5	 I wouldn't why you win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4473.9s	4473.9	 That's why you that's why I wouldn't feel the need to be so out there on this issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4477.5s	4477.5	 if the foreign policy establishment was doing its job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4480.6s	4480.6	 If you actually had, you know, people from the policy elite going out there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4486.4s	4486.4	 saying sensible things about Ukraine, it wouldn't fall on me or other people like China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4492.2s	4492.2	 Like Elon basically posted that straw poll on Twitter, which was totally reasonable,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4497.8s	4497.8	 got condemned for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4499.0s	4499.0	 And then Bill Ackman actually, who's been in Twitter spats with me before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4502.7s	4502.7	 we've been on opposite sides of issues, actually came out and retweeted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4507.0s	4507.0	 something I wrote as basically being supportive because the weird thing is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4511.6s	4511.6	 want this war to escalate out of control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4513.8s	4513.8	 I think the weird thing is people are there's a group in the in the media class,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4518.6s	4518.6	 other podcasters, other journalists who are saying you have no right to talk about this topic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4523.7s	4523.7	 And what I said is, you know, hey, listen, Sachs and I could disagree about things on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4527.4s	4527.4	 the margin here or there, but I'm glad we're having the discussion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4530.2s	4530.2	 Shouldn't all Americans be having a discussion about our foreign policy and what our goals are?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4534.2s	4534.2	 That's our civic duty is to have this discussion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4536.7s	4536.7	 So whenever you hear the political class, the podcasting class, the coastal elites,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4541.0s	4541.0	 which we are part of when they tell you you can't participate or this person can't participate in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4545.7s	4545.7	 the discussion because they're successful in this other aspect of life, that's complete bullshit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4550.0s	4550.0	 Everybody should talk about this and disagree or agree and try to work towards some common
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4554.9s	4554.9	 understanding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4555.6s	4555.6	 You're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4556.1s	4556.1	 So first of all, whenever they say listen to the experts and you're not an expert,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4560.2s	4560.2	 first of all, they're expressing an opinion themselves and they are expressing equally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4564.8s	4564.8	 passionate opinions on the other side about this whole Ukraine war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4568.0s	4568.0	 So first of all, why are they allowed to have an opinion?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4570.2s	4570.2	 So whenever somebody uses this, you're not allowed to have an opinion argument.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4573.5s	4573.5	 It's always very selective and it's only applied to people they disagree with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4578.2s	4578.2	 not to people who are equally inexpert on their side of the debate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4581.8s	4581.8	 So that's point number one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4583.0s	4583.0	 Hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4583.4s	4583.4	 Point number two is I've listened to plenty of experts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4586.4s	4586.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4587.2s	4587.2	 I've listened to the IR scholar, John Mearsheimer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4589.2s	4589.2	 I've listened to the international development economist, Jeffrey Sachs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4591.8s	4591.8	 I've gone back and listened to our former ambassador to the Soviet Union, Jack Matlock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4596.9s	4596.9	 I've read George Kennan's interviews.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4598.9s	4598.9	 I've read Bill Burns, our current CIA director on this matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4602.0s	4602.0	 There are plenty of experts who warned that our policy of trying to bring NATO right up to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4609.0s	4609.0	 Russia's border would eventually blow up in our faces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4611.8s	4611.8	 It would poison our relations with them and lead to conflict and this war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4617.0s	4617.0	 So there are plenty of authoritative sources going back many years on this topic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4622.4s	4622.4	 And the problem is that the people on the other side of this debate simply want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4626.3s	4626.3	 memory hole all of these warnings and deny that this war was ever predicted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4632.0s	4632.0	 Because if this war was predicted, it means it could have been avoided.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4635.2s	4635.2	 And they don't want to admit that this war could have been avoided.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4637.8s	4637.8	 Or how about this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4639.1s	4639.1	 How about war is messy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4641.0s	4641.0	 Resolving things internationally with dictators can be very hard and nobody wins in some of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4646.5s	4646.5	 these cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4647.1s	4647.1	 There's no perfect outcome here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4648.9s	4648.9	 And you could hold in your head two things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4651.1s	4651.1	 Number one, Putin's a dictator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4652.6s	4652.6	 We need to hold the line and make sure it doesn't invade other countries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4655.0s	4655.0	 And number two, yeah, you probably want to keep normal relations with these people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4660.0s	4660.0	 and negotiate with them to resolve conflict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4662.8s	4662.8	 I'm getting a little concerned about the saber rattling on both sides in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4666.6s	4666.6	 You know, we're escalating all this chip stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4668.5s	4668.5	 We're escalating and Xi Jinping is taking complete control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4672.2s	4672.2	 I'm wondering who's going to meet with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4673.8s	4673.8	 Who's going to talk to Xi Jinping about how we could collaborate together?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4677.1s	4677.1	 Who's left to talk to him?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4678.2s	4678.2	 Tim Cook, there's a bunch of unforced errors happening in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4681.6s	4681.6	 How do we deescalate?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4682.6s	4682.6	 Well, there's a bunch of unforced errors that you have to let play out because they have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4686.5s	4686.5	 huge economic implications.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4688.6s	4688.6	 So I don't think this is a time for again, I think David's generally right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4693.9s	4693.9	 We do not have time for adventurism right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4697.1s	4697.1	 Because even before we engage in some of these other places,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4701.0s	4701.0	 there are a lot of headwinds that are working against for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4704.6s	4704.6	 So for example, in China, you have these massive demographic headwinds that are just building.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4710.5s	4710.5	 We have to see what the Chips Act does in terms of follow through to China's ability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4715.0s	4715.0	 to expand militarily or technologically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4718.3s	4718.3	 There are all of these things that you owe as a citizen of the United States to see some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4724.1s	4724.1	 more data on the ground in terms of its empirical impact before you re-underwrite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4727.8s	4727.8	 a different strategy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4728.7s	4728.7	 Right now, the strategy is working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4730.8s	4730.8	 You know, we are observing this one China policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4734.9s	4734.9	 I think that's the right thing to do and now let all of this other stuff play out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4738.4s	4738.4	 Can I say one thing about China?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4740.3s	4740.3	 So what the administration did in banning China from buying from us or any of our allied
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4746.6s	4746.6	 countries these advanced semiconductor chips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4748.9s	4748.9	 That's what they did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4749.8s	4749.8	 They don't only ban the sale of chips to China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4752.0s	4752.0	 They banned the sale of equipment that can make the chips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4754.7s	4754.7	 And they even prohibited American citizens and companies from working in China to basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4760.2s	4760.2	 help them set up their own foundries and chip fabrication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4763.5s	4763.5	 So they are essentially cutting off China from advanced chips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4768.2s	4768.2	 That's the goal here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4769.7s	4769.7	 And we've talked about on this pod before how chips are the new oil, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4773.8s	4773.8	 These advanced semiconductors are the new oil.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4777.2s	4777.2	 So this is almost like an oil embargo of China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4780.9s	4780.9	 If you go back and look at it, if you go back and look at it, why the reason why is they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4786.4s	4786.4	 don't want these in weapons, correct?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4787.9s	4787.9	 That is the stated reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4789.0s	4789.0	 No, it's not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4789.8s	4789.8	 We think these are going to go in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4790.7s	4790.7	 They know they said this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4791.8s	4791.8	 That's the tip of the spear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4793.8s	4793.8	 But I think the more impactful mechanism is to prevent an entire layer of infrastructure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4801.7s	4801.7	 to be built in China that allows them to advance all of these next generation cyber capabilities,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4807.3s	4807.3	 including a whole bunch of things in AI that we want to make sure that as often as possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4815.6s	4815.6	 is for the United States and our allies as we choose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4819.7s	4819.7	 So all this next generation silicon will do a lot more to push that forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4825.0s	4825.0	 And so if you put that in the hands of Chinese technology companies or Chinese government,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4829.8s	4829.8	 the Chinese government in the parts that are actually technological,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4833.9s	4833.9	 you actually increase the surface area in which you compete by preventing that technology to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4839.7s	4839.7	 to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4840.2s	4840.2	 You decrease the surface area in which you're competitive and they are one or two steps behind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4844.9s	4844.9	 and are forced to build it themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4846.9s	4846.9	 So Friedberg, if that happens, do you think that China escalates and says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4851.8s	4851.8	 well, why are we building iPhones here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4853.9s	4853.9	 No, I think China makes decisions a little differently than perhaps US policy makers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4861.4s	4861.4	 and foreign policy makers make decisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4865.5s	4865.5	 They think forward and calculate the series of events that will follow from that decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4871.4s	4871.4	 Whereas we are typically reacting to some event that's happened in the past,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4875.4s	4875.4	 not necessarily always thinking through the second and third order effects and consequences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4880.8s	4880.8	 of our decisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4882.1s	4882.1	 So the China calculus would likely look something more like if we were to say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4886.1s	4886.1	 stop making iPhones here, we would estimate that the US would do the following to retaliate back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4891.0s	4891.0	 against us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4892.0s	4892.0	 And as they do through that calculation, you end up realizing pretty quickly that there isn't as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4896.7s	4896.7	 much to gain as there is more to lose by doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4900.0s	4900.0	 That would be my guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4901.2s	4901.2	 I'm no China expert.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4902.4s	4902.4	 I'm no foreign policy expert.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4904.2s	4904.2	 But from my understanding of how Chinese policymakers do think and do make decisions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4909.0s	4909.0	 it's much more about what's the rational calculated set of outcomes that will emerge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4913.8s	4913.8	 and evolve from this decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4915.8s	4915.8	 And in my experience talking with people in the United States that are in various communities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4920.6s	4920.6	 of influence, it's much more about let's do what we consider to be the right or moral thing right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4925.4s	4925.4	 now and in response and retaliation and let's do an eye for an eye.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4929.4s	4929.4	 So that's why I don't think that they're likely to be the first step in an escalation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4934.2s	4934.2	 escalatory ladder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4936.3s	4936.3	 There'll probably be a few more series of provocations before that may happen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4940.7s	4940.7	 at which point it may need to be kind of an inevitable step that they'd have to take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4943.8s	4943.8	 But what do you think, Zach?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4945.1s	4945.1	 I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4946.3s	4946.3	 I mean, so in terms of the motivation for this, I think it's pretty clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4949.8s	4949.8	 This is an attempt to hobble the Chinese economy, not just all their weapons programs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4955.8s	4955.8	 but their economy itself and hold them back and slow down their rise and their rapid growth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4961.5s	4961.5	 Now, is that a good idea?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4962.8s	4962.8	 I mean, I think what this shows is we've moved from sort of economic logic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4967.3s	4967.3	 which is about finding trade surplus and win-win scenarios to geopolitical logic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4972.2s	4972.2	 which is about balance of power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4974.3s	4974.3	 And this sort of ban on sales of semiconductors to them, it's very much geopolitical because it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4980.1s	4980.1	 hurting our companies, but it hurts China more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4982.6s	4982.6	 And so it's about increasing our balance of power against them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4987.9s	4987.9	 And now listen, I think you can make the argument that we were overdue to be thinking in terms of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4995.0s	4995.0	 great power competition and geopolitical rivalry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=4998.0s	4998.0	 And this is an attempt now to correct the bad decisions that were made 20 years ago in terms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5004.2s	5004.2	 of how we fed the Chinese economy until it became a pure competitor to the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5008.9s	5008.9	 So I think you can make those arguments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5011.5s	5011.5	 The thing that concerns me most about it is, do our leaders really have the bandwidth to manage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5020.4s	5020.4	 a second front in the sort of great power competition right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5023.9s	5023.9	 While we've got Russia and Ukraine going on, on the one hand, are they really ready
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5029.3s	5029.3	 to manage an escalation of the competition with China?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5032.8s	5032.8	 And to Freeberg's point, have they really thought through all the second, third, fourth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5036.9s	5036.9	 order consequences of this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5038.4s	5038.4	 Have they thought through the incentives this may create on China, for example, to take Taiwan?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5043.5s	5043.5	 I mean, if Taiwan is the place that makes all these chips through TSMC, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5050.3s	5050.3	 and we have now cut them off, we have now embargoed them from these chips,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5054.1s	5054.1	 does it strengthen China's incentive to go after Taiwan?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5057.4s	5057.4	 Does it strengthens China's incentives right now to help Russia in its war in Ukraine in retaliation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5064.4s	5064.4	 Because they don't want to see Russia decisively defeated and then they will solely be in the gun
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5071.9s	5071.9	 sights of US hawks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5074.0s	5074.0	 So I think there's a lot of things that could go wrong here when the US is now escalating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5081.0s	5081.0	 geopolitical tensions and competition, not just on one front, but on two fronts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5087.5s	5087.5	 And especially given how weak the US economy is and that we're headed into a major recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5093.3s	5093.3	 next year, it just feels to me like they are kind of putting their foot on the accelerator in terms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5100.3s	5100.3	 of geopolitical risk at a time when we're not really in a great spot to be taking those risks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5105.6s	5105.6	 Well, also on a foreign policy basis, is there no common ground?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5109.4s	5109.4	 Are there no things we could collaborate on and work on together?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5113.2s	5113.2	 That's the thing that seems to be missing in the foreign policy for the last couple of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5116.9s	5116.9	 administrations is, are there things that we could be building together?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5120.4s	5120.4	 Are there things that we could be working on the environment, energy, sustainability, education?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5125.9s	5125.9	 I don't know what it is, but it felt like with China for a couple of decades, we felt like we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5130.2s	5130.2	 were working in a very collaborative way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5132.4s	5132.4	 And now it feels like every single instance is adversarial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5135.8s	5135.8	 Right. Because the problem is that those policies of constructive engagement that you're talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5140.6s	5140.6	 about fed the Chinese tiger until it became a dragon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5144.6s	5144.6	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5145.1s	5145.1	 Now it's the size of a vagar or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5147.5s	5147.5	 That's also a vagar level dragon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5149.5s	5149.5	 It's a vagar level threat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5151.2s	5151.2	 Vagar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5153.4s	5153.4	 And the U.S. policy establishment in the Pentagon look at the rise of China,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5158.3s	5158.3	 and they're like, what have we done?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5159.9s	5159.9	 We have created a peer competitor to the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5162.1s	5162.1	 We need to stop their economic rise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5165.0s	5165.0	 And I think that, again, I think there is a geopolitical logic and strategy to what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5170.6s	5170.6	 administration has done, but I question the timing of doing it at the same time that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5174.8s	5174.8	 have this unresolved war in Eastern Europe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5177.4s	5177.4	 Well, it is nice that we're seem to be getting some of this on-shoring of chips and that money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5181.4s	5181.4	 is actually starting to flow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5182.2s	5182.2	 It does seem like we're thinking a little bit like in decades and strategies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5185.8s	5185.8	 Wait, say the other part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5186.5s	5186.5	 I think Biden and Blinken have done a good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5188.3s	5188.3	 They've done a good job on this right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5189.8s	5189.8	 They've played it well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5192.2s	5192.2	 Well, I don't know about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5194.5s	5194.5	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5195.1s	5195.1	 First of all, Biden and Blinken did a horrible job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5198.5s	5198.5	 Hold on a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5199.1s	5199.1	 Biden and Blinken did a horrible job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5200.7s	5200.7	 Poke the tiger, Trumont.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5202.9s	5202.9	 You poked the tiger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5204.2s	5204.2	 No, hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5205.1s	5205.1	 I'll tell you why they did a bad job is last year they had a whole year to negotiate to avoid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5210.4s	5210.4	 this Ukraine war from happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5212.3s	5212.3	 Biden even had a summit with Putin on June 16th last year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5216.2s	5216.2	 They never engaged in diplomacy and now they have stacked this geopolitical risk with China
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5221.3s	5221.3	 on top of the risk they've already created in Ukraine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5225.0s	5225.0	 This policy may or may not ultimately turn out to be correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5227.7s	5227.7	 Like I said, I can see the strategy behind it, but I do not believe that Biden and Blinken
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5232.5s	5232.5	 have thought through the second, third and fourth order consequences, just like Friedberg said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5237.5s	5237.5	 So I think it's a little early to be giving them credit on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5240.2s	5240.2	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5241.0s	5241.0	 Friedberg, you got anything in the science corner?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5242.5s	5242.5	 We gave we gave Sachs's red meat and he ripped it to shreds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5247.0s	5247.0	 Now it's time to give you your soy tofu burger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5249.6s	5249.6	 I'll give you guys a quick science corner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5251.5s	5251.5	 Please, please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5252.4s	5252.4	 So we've talked in the past about the human gut biome, 10 trillion bacterial cells living
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5257.0s	5257.0	 in our gut biome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5258.1s	5258.1	 And it turns out, and there has been this theory for many years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5260.8s	5260.8	 that a lot of human disease actually originates in the gut.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5264.2s	5264.2	 And there's increasingly evidence of how and why this happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5267.0s	5267.0	 So it turns out that your immune cells can sometimes see a protein on the outside of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5272.4s	5272.4	 a bacteria that sits in your gut and it attacks that bacteria and it tries to get rid of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5277.0s	5277.0	 That protein can look a little bit like a human protein at some cell in your body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5281.5s	5281.5	 And so that then triggers an autoimmune reaction, meaning you are now making these antibodies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5287.2s	5287.2	 to proteins that look a lot like your proteins in other parts of your body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5292.0s	5292.0	 And then your cells start to destroy yourself and you end up having inflammation and disease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5296.8s	5296.8	 And they found evidence of this across a lot of disease states.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5299.6s	5299.6	 So just the other day, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5304.2s	5304.2	 was a really interesting paper by a team that identified a very specific bacteria that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5309.8s	5309.8	 find in the gut that can actually trigger rheumatoid arthritis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5314.1s	5314.1	 And so, you know, I think two million Americans have rheumatoid arthritis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5317.6s	5317.6	 It's a really debilitating inflammatory disease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5320.1s	5320.1	 And we never understood where the inflammation comes from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5322.8s	5322.8	 Why is the human immune cell creating antibodies to attack its own protein in the joints of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5329.3s	5329.3	 body? And now it looks like that the protein that we find in the joints of the body has some overlap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5334.0s	5334.0	 or three-dimensional structure that looks similar to the protein we'll find on this very specific
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5339.3s	5339.3	 gut bacteria that they found, which creates obviously a path now for if we can stop that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5344.3s	5344.3	 gut bacteria from proliferating or, you know, existing in the gut over time, that can have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5350.9s	5350.9	 reduction in the incidence rate of rheumatoid arthritis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5353.9s	5353.9	 Did they guess what the mechanism of action was?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5357.8s	5357.8	 So the mechanism of action is typically what's called, generally speaking, protein mimicry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5362.1s	5362.1	 And so protein mimicry means that there's some... So think about a protein as being like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5367.1s	5367.1	 you know, a clumpy rock. And there's some part of the clumpy rock that looks a little bit like the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5372.6s	5372.6	 part of another clumpy rock. And that's the protein. Think about that as being the protein
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5376.9s	5376.9	 on the bacterial cell and the protein in your joint cells. And so your body makes an antibody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5382.2s	5382.2	 to that little part of the rock on the bacterial cell to get rid of it. And then there's some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5387.1s	5387.1	 overlap that looks a little bit like your own cell. And so that's called protein mimicry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5391.0s	5391.0	 And because of the ability now to do DNA sequencing, and now with, you know, some of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5396.7s	5396.7	 the Alpha Fold technology, we can actually take the genome from that bacteria, predict the 3D
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5403.7s	5403.7	 structure of the proteins created by that bacteria, and then potentially identify that there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5409.0s	5409.0	 mimicry or an overlap between our own protein and our cells and the protein of the bacteria,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5414.1s	5414.1	 which is why we're having autoimmunity, which now our immune cells are not just attacking the bacteria.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5418.6s	5418.6	 We could solve arthritis. We solve for arthritis. And so there's a lot of disease states that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5422.5s	5422.5	 starting to look like this. So the combination of DNA sequencing and our ability to identify
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5426.5s	5426.5	 organisms in the gut biome, and by the way, so much of this goes back to the gut biome,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5429.8s	5429.8	 we're finding all these disease states from lupus to show grins to rheumatoid arthritis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5434.1s	5434.1	 that have some linkage back to some bacteria that shows up in your gut. And so now we can be very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5439.1s	5439.1	 targeted potentially about eradicating that bacteria from the gut or, you know, kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5443.8s	5443.8	 changing our gut biome in a way that ultimately resolves to eliminating that disease risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5449.1s	5449.1	 And so it's really fascinating. Yeah. Chamath, any thoughts on this gut biome?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5452.6s	5452.6	 I mean, I always knew the solution was either in Freberg's gut, you know, or his anus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5462.4s	5462.4	 In his gut or on your anus? Freberg's science corner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5467.6s	5467.6	 All right. Do it again. Do it again. The joke didn't land. All right. Here we go. One more time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5472.2s	5472.2	 So Chamath, any feedback on this? There's pretty great science going on here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5476.1s	5476.1	 I mean, it was always 50-50 that the solution was either your gut or your anus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5482.9s	5482.9	 Okay. You can't laugh till after you land the joke. Come on. Do it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5486.1s	5486.1	 I saw it coming. It was coming around the corner and I just started peeking its head out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5490.9s	5490.9	 Leave this all in. I started peeking out of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5492.6s	5492.6	 Let's get this right for the fans. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5494.2s	5494.2	 Okay. Here we go. Three, two. All right. Chamath, it seems like very interesting science.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5498.3s	5498.3	 They're coming in the science corner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5502.6s	5502.6	 50-50. You're gut or your anus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5507.4s	5507.4	 You can't even get it out. I mean, you tried to get it out of his anus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5512.2s	5512.2	 It was poking. It was like a little turtle coming out of his anus, but you couldn't get it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5515.8s	5515.8	 Oh my gosh. 50-50-50.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5521.0s	5521.0	 It's like the entire science corner is just here for us to beat up the nerd and throw him in a locker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5527.8s	5527.8	 Oh my God. My stomach is hurting. Oh my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5531.8s	5531.8	 Poor guy. Oh, I needed that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5533.5s	5533.5	 You ever see Smokey and the Bandit when they have the reels at the end,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5536.5s	5536.5	 Sachs? The outtakes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5545.2s	5545.2	 corner and people are going to just start laughing and thinking about Freeberg's anus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5552.9s	5552.9	 All right. Listen. Welcome home, Sachs. We miss you for your week off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5557.9s	5557.9	 We missed you, David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5559.0s	5559.0	 We missed you, David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5559.6s	5559.6	 Thanks, guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5560.3s	5560.3	 Thanks. And we'll see you over on Market Street. No announcements right now. No testimonials,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5565.0s	5565.0	 no announcements. I'll see you at yoga. We're going to do a...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5568.4s	5568.4	 I'll see you at the homeless shelter. We're volunteering today, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5571.3s	5571.3	 Yeah, volunteering. I'll see you over at the homeless shelter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5573.7s	5573.7	 You're pouring soup?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5574.7s	5574.7	 Yeah. If you could get me a tofu salad with extra tempeh before Freeberg eats it all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5579.3s	5579.3	 Tempeh. Don't get me started on tempeh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5582.6s	5582.6	 I'm going to go. I'm going to pour all the oatmeal out. I'm going right to the canteen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5585.6s	5585.6	 I'm going to pour all the oatmeal out. I'm going right to the cafe. I'm going right to the cafe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5589.0s	5589.0	 I'm getting all the oatmeal right down the drain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5591.4s	5591.4	 Honestly, there should be one non-lactose alternative and then one milk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5599.0s	5599.0	 Black coffee. Black coffee. That's it. If you're lactose intolerant,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5602.0s	5602.0	 yeah, lactose intolerant milk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5603.1s	5603.1	 No, have one thing without lactose. So whatever that is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5606.9s	5606.9	 Can we wrap the show now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5608.3s	5608.3	 No, we're having too much fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5609.9s	5609.9	 What's up? Can you imagine the distribution of gluten-free snacks? I mean, there should have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5616.3s	5616.3	 few, but you know, all kinds of different snacks. And by the way, the keto snacks have horrendous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5621.2s	5621.2	 amounts of chemicals in it. The xylitol. What is xylitol? Why would you eat that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5626.1s	5626.1	 Xylitol will screw up your stomach. I do not have that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5628.4s	5628.4	 It's horrible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5629.3s	5629.3	 Freeberg, you want to tell everybody about xylitol and the impact it has on your anus?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5632.5s	5632.5	 No, it seriously does. I think xylitol is a thing that gives you a lot of gas and you just keep ripping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5644.4s	5644.4	 I think it's really bad for you. Here's an idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5651.0s	5651.0	 Way to go, J. Cal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5652.4s	5652.4	 Yeah, now he's going to turn into a school shooter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5654.3s	5654.3	 Well, that's your fault. You were mean to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5656.4s	5656.4	 You came up with the anus jokes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5658.9s	5658.9	 I've been doing that joke for five years with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5662.5s	5662.5	 You're a bully. You're not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5664.2s	5664.2	 No, no, no. Sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5664.9s	5664.9	 You bullied Freeberg off the show. You brigaded him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5667.0s	5667.0	 I did not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5667.8s	5667.8	 We brigadoned him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5670.1s	5670.1	 We brigadoned our bestie. Sorry, bestie. All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5672.7s	5672.7	 Four, the dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya going into sweater season. I might know it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5677.5s	5677.5	 going to be a big, big Q4 for us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5679.7s	5679.7	 Big Q4.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bIpJdaCnM&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=20&t=5680.4s	5680.4	 And the beep of the beep corporation, David Sacks.
