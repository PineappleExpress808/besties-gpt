https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=520.7s	520.7	 has been on top of this issue. 77% of Americans were either

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=538.4s	538.4	 this right. Sax, what are your thoughts on inflation, which now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=542.5s	542.5	 seems acute and permanent?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=545.0s	545.0	 Right? Well, it's definitely not transitory. Remember when it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=548.6s	548.6	 at about 5.1% over the summer, that the administration said no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=553.2s	553.2	 big deal. This is transitory, don't panic. Then it went to 6.2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=557.1s	557.1	 now at 6.8 looks like it's headed to 7%. And the real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=561.5s	561.5	 problem here is that these guys, the administration have not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=565.0s	565.0	 adjusted course in light of this data, what they've tried to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=567.8s	567.8	 instead, is now speciously claim that the same bills that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=572.8s	572.8	 had written and conceived the build back better bill, somehow,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=576.1s	576.1	 even though it was conceived at a time that was really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=579.8s	579.8	 deflationary, that somehow this is going to fight inflation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=582.4s	582.4	 they're essentially repurposing, they're just changing the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=584.9s	584.9	 arguments they're using, as opposed to changing their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=587.7s	587.7	 legislative priorities. And just today, we got a report from CBO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=592.2s	592.2	 saying that this build back better bill wasn't going to cost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=595.3s	595.3	 $2 trillion, like the administration said, it's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=597.1s	597.1	 to cost $5 trillion, and add $3 trillion to the deficit over 10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=600.5s	600.5	 years, correct? Over 10 years, if those programs are not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=603.6s	603.6	 sunsetted. So there's a bunch of budgetary gimmicks that were put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=606.3s	606.3	 in the bill. Basically, a lot of the programs would sunset after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=610.2s	610.2	 one year or three or six years. And so that's the only way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=614.3s	614.3	 they've gotten it to this, you know, $1.9 trillion price tag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=617.9s	617.9	 The reason why that's a gimmick is because once the programs are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=621.1s	621.1	 created, there's going to be it will create a special interest or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=625.1s	625.1	 constituency who is now dependent on those programs, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=628.2s	628.2	 no one's ever going to want to cut them. Milton Friedman's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=630.7s	630.7	 Milton Friedman famously said that there's nothing quite so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=633.2s	633.2	 permanent as a temporary government program. So that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=636.0s	636.0	 the game that progressives are playing is they're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=637.8s	637.8	 create the dependent, the dependency, the constituency who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=642.1s	642.1	 once they receive the program is never going to want to give it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=644.5s	644.5	 up. And they're counting on the fact that these programs will not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=647.2s	647.2	 sunset, which means they will cost 5 trillion, and it will add
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=651.1s	651.1	 $3 trillion to the deficit. So, you know, the problem is, it'd be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=656.0s	656.0	 one thing if we were in a deflationary environment, if the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=658.8s	658.8	 economy was in the tank, but these guys are continuing to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=662.0s	662.0	 pump more and more stimulus into an economy that has enough. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=666.3s	666.3	 really, Larry Summers made this point all the way back in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=668.7s	668.7	 February, I think this is worth reading what he said, he said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=671.6s	671.6	 there's a chance that macroeconomic stimulus on a scale
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=674.7s	674.7	 closer to World War Two levels than normal recession levels,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=677.9s	677.9	 were set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=680.4s	680.4	 seen in a generation. He said this in February, everyone in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=683.1s	683.1	 the administration dismissed him all the liberal economists that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=686.7s	686.7	 you mentioned basically derided him, he turned out to be exactly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=689.8s	689.8	 right. And he was just saying this about the the one point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=694.4s	694.4	 roughly 2 trillion they passed back in February for a COVID
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=698.0s	698.0	 stimulus. And you know, since then, they passed 1.2 trillion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=702.1s	702.1	 for infrastructure. And now it's this another 5 trillion for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=706.0s	706.0	 build back better. So, you know, the real problem here is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=709.6s	709.6	 they are not adjusting course in light of this data that keeps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=713.9s	713.9	 coming out that inflation is a bigger and bigger. What's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=716.4s	716.4	 right thing to do in your mind, Sachs? And then we'll go to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=718.4s	718.4	 to launch at it. Can this bill we don't need it. This is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=721.6s	721.6	 what Biden was elected to do. You know, he was elected to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=725.5s	725.5	 provide normalcy stop the chaos. And he never got a mandate for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=729.8s	729.8	 this kind of, you know, whatever 10 trillion dollars we've been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=733.5s	733.5	 wanting to do an infrastructure bill for a long time, but we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=737.0s	737.0	 didn't that was prior to pumping so much stimulus into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=740.8s	740.8	 the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=741.2s	741.2	 It's just on the infrastructure bill and not the build back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=743.6s	743.6	 better, it would have been one thing. But we're this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=746.3s	746.3	 basically the third hyper stimulatory bill that that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=750.4s	750.4	 they've sought to pass. First they did the COVID release bill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=754.2s	754.2	 at a time when really the economy didn't need that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=758.0s	758.0	 stimulus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=759.6s	759.6	 Dovetailing this, I'm getting a mouth involved in this is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=761.9s	761.9	 jobs report. November non farm payrolls increased only 210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=766.4s	766.4	 they expected it to be 573. So it's a big miss. However, kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=770.7s	770.7	 of a missed bag because there's over 11 million job openings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=773.8s	773.8	 And we're now at 4.2% unemployment rate, which is the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=781.3s	781.3	 like before the 2008 financial crisis. Chamath, how do you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=785.6s	785.6	 reconcile inflation, along with this crazy, bizarre job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=790.2s	790.2	 situation where people will not go back to work, people are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=793.2s	793.2	 planning on resigning, there continues to be resignations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=795.5s	795.5	 and there's too many job openings, and people are raising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=797.7s	797.7	 salaries and still can't hire people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=800.3s	800.3	 Well, I think we did a pretty good job of unpacking the great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=803.9s	803.9	 resignation. I think it was last pod. So right? Remember, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=807.3s	807.3	 yeah, there are three structural issues at play in the jobs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=811.8s	811.8	 front. One is that you have this really meaningful under
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=815.8s	815.8	 immigration that's happened because of Trump. The second was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=819.9s	819.9	 you've had a big mismatch between the degree classes in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=823.8s	823.8	 America and the jobs that they can have for what they think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=826.8s	826.8	 they should earn. Meaning, you go to school, you get into all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=830.7s	830.7	 this debt, you try to become a teacher or something, and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=833.5s	833.5	 you realize you can make more at an Amazon warehouse. Crazy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=837.2s	837.2	 strange. And then the fourth is you have all these boomers with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=840.7s	840.7	 an enormous amount of savings 30 40 $50 trillion, who are pulling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=845.4s	845.4	 forward their retirement and also subsidizing their kids. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=848.8s	848.8	 put it all together, there's less of an incentive to be in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=851.2s	851.2	 job force unless you pay higher wages. Now, let's just put a pin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=855.2s	855.2	 in that for a second. I think the thing that sax talked about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=857.9s	857.9	 is really important, which is that we have to really figure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=861.2s	861.2	 out whether inflation is transitory or it's persistent and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=864.6s	864.6	 it's here. And I just want to bring up all Nick, I'll send you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=868.2s	868.2	 these texts, these the Twitter links to this, but Bill Ackman
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=872.3s	872.3	 tweeted out these two things today, which is that if you fan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=874.8s	874.8	 of the pod, brilliant investor, by the way, great human being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=878.0s	878.0	 brilliant investor, two very specific things, he actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=881.1s	881.1	 called out something that we've we also mentioned before, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=884.3s	884.3	 is that CPI is horribly calculated, and it's really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=889.4s	889.4	 imprecise. And if you unpack CPI, there's something price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=894.3s	894.3	 index, the consumer price index, there's something in there, a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=897.2s	897.2	 component of it. That's very important, which is called the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=900.5s	900.5	 owner's equivalent rent, right? How much can somebody basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=903.7s	903.7	 charge rent to other people? The way that they calculate that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=907.4s	907.4	 which is 30% of the 30% of the calculation is they just survey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=914.2s	914.2	 a handful of people. The problem is you don't need to survey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=918.2s	918.2	 because the actual exact data is available from single family
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=923.6s	923.6	 rentals that report this number. So their survey showed basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=928.8s	928.8	 a much, much smaller increase than what the actual increase is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=933.6s	933.6	 And let me just give it so the largest owners of nationwide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=936.7s	936.7	 single family rentals are reporting a 17% year over year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=940.8s	940.8	 rent increase. Wow, the the OER that was calculated, quote unquote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=945.7s	945.7	 by survey and the CPI was 3.5%. If you flow that through, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=950.2s	950.2	 means that core CPI actually went from 4.9% today to actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=956.5s	956.5	 9%. And the CPI print, which was 6.8% was actually 10.5%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=963.4s	963.4	 and now it's 9.1%. So it just goes to show you we have sources
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=970.7s	970.7	 of data that the government is not in a position to collect or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=974.3s	974.3	 measure. We have horribly inaccurate econometric models
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=979.1s	979.1	 that we use. You know, you know that phrase sort of shit in shit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=982.7s	982.7	 out. So unfortunately, you get very bad garbage. You get very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=986.2s	986.2	 bad crappy data. And now all of a sudden, we're printing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=989.6s	989.6	 numbers, we're supposed to make policy against those numbers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=992.4s	992.4	 And so we're like, well, we're going to have to rely on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=994.6s	994.6	 decision making is fundamentally flawed. And it's flawed in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=997.5s	997.5	 wrong direction. Okay, let's bring freeburg and freeburg.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1041.4s	1041.4	 this guy has a multi billion dollar consumer credit portfolio
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1044.6s	1044.6	 and subprime, which means you know, he's got the bunch of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1047.6s	1047.6	 consumers owe him money that generally there's going to be a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1051.8s	1051.8	 high default rate and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1055.6s	1055.6	 no comment, not. And he said that this year the portfolio
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1060.4s	1060.4	 performed beyond like the one percentile of the model
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1063.5s	1063.5	 distribution of what they expected to happen. They had the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1066.8s	1066.8	 yield on the portfolio be 40% higher than they thought it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1069.5s	1069.5	 would be. Because there's so much liquidity in the hands of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1074.0s	1074.0	 individuals. And so I think, you know, Jason, while you might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1077.6s	1077.6	 make the argument that companies and jobs are being created, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1081.1s	1081.1	 is one of many places where like, you know, you overflow a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1083.7s	1083.7	 river and lots of streams start to flow. You know, we're seeing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1097.9s	1097.9	 problem with inflation is, you know, it's a definitionally, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1103.0s	1103.0	 all use this term and we throw it about but like inflation is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1105.6s	1105.6	 really the measure of price going up over a period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1110.4s	1110.4	 And generally, you want to have inflation of some amount that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1114.0s	1114.0	 allows you to see economic growth and expansion that allows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1117.2s	1117.2	 you to fund the debt that you used to create that growth in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1120.2s	1120.2	 the first place. And so without inflate without some sort of an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1123.6s	1123.6	 inflationary pressure, which is the output of economic growth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1126.5s	1126.5	 you end up, you know, being unable to meet your debt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1129.0s	1129.0	 obligations, and then things get really ugly. And the system as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1133.0s	1133.0	 it was constructed, because most of these governments and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1135.0s	1135.0	 systems like we have today are funded by debt. So, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1140.4s	1140.4	 Stan Druckenmiller gave a good interview on Q2, he was kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1143.0s	1143.0	 on a roadshow, you know, sounding the alarm bells around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1146.2s	1146.2	 what was going on. He was saying the market is not speaking right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1149.2s	1149.2	 now. Because basically, the Fed kept canceling the market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1152.8s	1152.8	 signals with their with their interest rate policy. And by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1157.2s	1157.2	 canceling those market signals, it seemed like we had a free for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1160.2s	1160.2	 all at the government level to keep spending. And so I do think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1163.5s	1163.5	 that these two are pretty interrelated. The fact that we've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1165.8s	1165.8	 kept interest rates low have allowed policymakers to say, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1168.9s	1168.9	 know what, the cost of debt for this government is zero, we can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1171.3s	1171.3	 do anything we want, just like consumers are saying, we can do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1174.1s	1174.1	 anything we want, we can buy anything we want, we can spend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1176.1s	1176.1	 any way we want. And as a result, we're kind of seeing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1178.7s	1178.7	 this, you know, inflationary pressure persists. Now, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1182.4s	1182.4	 problem is, if you then raise rates, and you can't borrow that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1185.4s	1185.4	 money, and suddenly people have to start to pay that debt down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1189.0s	1189.0	 without economic growth having occurred, the business goes the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1193.0s	1193.0	 whole system goes bankrupt. So the challenge that the Fed has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1196.5s	1196.5	 is how do we raise rates without triggering an economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1199.5s	1199.5	 recession. And if people are now have overspended and are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1202.8s	1202.8	 overlevered once again, and rates go up, it's going to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1206.6s	1206.6	 really ugly really fast. And so this is a first derivative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1210.1s	1210.1	 balancing act. And yeah, there's no simple and easy solution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1214.8s	1214.8	 Unfortunately, meanwhile, technology is causing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1217.4s	1217.4	 deflationary pressures, which is exactly, you know, maybe what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1220.2s	1220.2	 you don't want to see happen when you're trying to realize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1222.2s	1222.2	 economic growth. And that's, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1225.3s	1225.3	 The other thing that we talked about is that the Fed basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1228.6s	1228.6	 changed the, or the government changed the rules on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1232.6s	1232.6	 percentage. Basically, what qualifies as a conforming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1237.4s	1237.4	 mortgage, you remember that? And so now that's basically at a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1240.7s	1240.7	 million dollars. And if you think about it, most Americans,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1244.3s	1244.3	 you know, 80 to 90% of their true underlying wealth is their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1247.3s	1247.3	 home, to the extent that they build, you know, positive net
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1250.7s	1250.7	 worth. And if you all of a sudden, you know, push up the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1254.4s	1254.4	 upper bound on what a conforming mortgage is to a million, a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1257.4s	1257.4	 million dollars, that effectively means it's and it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1260.6s	1260.6	 roughly about 20%. That effectively means that you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1263.6s	1263.6	 moving people's net worth up by about four or 5%. That's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1267.3s	1267.3	 So and so if they take that, and then they take that money out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1270.6s	1270.6	 their home via a HELOC or an equity line of credit, right? Oh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1274.3s	1274.3	 my god, credit. And then, you know, to your point, Friedberg,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1277.5s	1277.5	 they spend it or they invested or they, you know, it could be a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1281.1s	1281.1	 real disaster scenario in five or six years. No, no, this is more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1286.0s	1286.0	 like 1929 kind of Yeah, by the way, if you go back to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1290.2s	1290.2	 remember when we were in like the depths of the market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1292.2s	1292.2	 collapsing and everything when basically the economy shut down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1295.0s	1295.0	 with lockdowns when COVID started. And I was speaking to a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1297.9s	1297.9	 senior banker at that, like that day. And he told me, look, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1302.4s	1302.4	 pretty simple what's going to happen. The Fed's going to drop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1304.8s	1304.8	 interest rates to zero, and they're going to pump money into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1306.5s	1306.5	 the system. Because that's the only way you're going to be able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1309.6s	1309.6	 to keep asset prices from collapsing. And we're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1312.2s	1312.2	 artificially inflate asset prices. And we're going to do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1314.7s	1314.7	 for a long time. Because then people look at the stock market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1317.2s	1317.2	 and they say, Oh, my gosh, stocks are going up. Oh, my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1319.8s	1319.8	 gosh, revenue is going up, everything gets inflated by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1322.6s	1322.6	 pumping money into the system. And the problem is, while
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1325.7s	1325.7	 there's, you know, a perceived you keep saying the home price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1328.5s	1328.5	 goes up, and I keep saying stocks go up. But the purchasing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1332.2s	1332.2	 power that arises when the inflation is higher than what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1335.9s	1335.9	 those things are going up at indicates economic recession
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1338.6s	1338.6	 underlying that inflationary bubble. And the circumstance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1342.2s	1342.2	 needs to be analyzed, unfortunately, a little bit more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1344.8s	1344.8	 deeper than that, which is it's not just about inflation, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1347.3s	1347.3	 about have we pumped enough money into trigger economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1350.7s	1350.7	 growth, that we can come to balance where the growth can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1353.2s	1353.2	 outpace the inflation, and we're not there. Well, superimposed on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1357.1s	1357.1	 this is like, think about it. Sorry, let me just say, let me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1359.1s	1359.1	 just say one simple analogy. Let's say I've got 50 clams. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1363.1s	1363.1	 you know, there's suddenly a bunch of clams come into the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1365.2s	1365.2	 clam market. Now I got 100 clams. And if the number of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1368.0s	1368.0	 clams has gone up by three x, my purchasing power has actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1370.8s	1370.8	 gone down by a third. While it might look like I've now got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1373.6s	1373.6	 twice as many clams, I can only buy one third as much as I could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1376.9s	1376.9	 buy before, because there's so many more clams floating around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1379.6s	1379.6	 And that's the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1380.5s	1380.5	 clams.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1381.2s	1381.2	 Oh, you look like clams.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1383.2s	1383.2	 clams. So you like I'm just, I listen, I did a little bit of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1386.6s	1386.6	 math, I've been watching the price to sales ratios of some of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1392.0s	1392.0	 the top companies, we can pull this up on the screen. And the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1397.2s	1397.2	 price to sales of companies, including zoom, obviously was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1403.5s	1403.5	 ridiculous. During the pandemic, that was a pandemic stock. So on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1407.4s	1407.4	 top of all of this money being printed into the system, you had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1410.2s	1410.2	 the participation of a bunch of stonk traders, you know, in that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1414.7s	1414.7	 whole movement, buying up meme stocks or others, we had the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1420.0s	1420.0	 price sales ratio of zoom, in other words, the value of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1423.7s	1423.7	 enterprise versus their actual sales was at 123. It's now at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1427.5s	1427.5	 14.7. Peloton was another one of those at 23 now down to three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1431.4s	1431.4	 x, down 87% Coinbase square also, it drops off pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1437.6s	1437.6	 significantly here. But you can also we looked at the peak price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1441.9s	1441.9	 to sales and how much larger it is then and so some of these are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1446.8s	1446.8	 now off 8x 4x and then it drops off to 2x 1x. But it's quite a I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1453.5s	1453.5	 don't know if you guys are looking at the numbers or if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1455.1s	1455.1	 have any thoughts on this, but we're reap it seems like there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1458.5s	1458.5	 was a mispricing of certain equities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1461.8s	1461.8	 And it wasn't a mispricing the Federal Reserve forced a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1465.7s	1465.7	 institutional investors to be out as long dated as possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1471.9s	1471.9	 In buying earnings, because if you have to remember, it's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1476.1s	1476.1	 just that real rates were effectively zero, but if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1478.7s	1478.7	 wanted to own inflation protected securities, it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1481.8s	1481.8	 actually a negative yield. So we were destroying people's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1484.7s	1484.7	 savings. And there are a lot of individuals sorry, well, not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1487.6s	1487.6	 individuals institutions that must own some of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1490.8s	1490.8	 inflation protected assets. So we were already in a negative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1493.6s	1493.6	 yield environment. What are those folks supposed to do if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1497.2s	1497.2	 they have to fund an 8% return a year to pay the pensions of, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1501.7s	1501.7	 know, good people, firefighters, teachers, you know, it's you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1505.3s	1505.3	 name it, policemen, etc. Right. They were forced to invest in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1510.8s	1510.8	 the kinds of funds that would then go out further and further
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1514.9s	1514.9	 out into the future to buy the promise of future cash flows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1519.7s	1519.7	 And when all of a sudden a whole bunch of other assets that that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1525.1s	1525.1	 they held, which were supposed to be safe implodes on them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1530.3s	1530.3	 right, because all of a sudden inflation changes, and the front
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1534.5s	1534.5	 end of the yield curve goes, and all of a sudden, all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1537.6s	1537.6	 assets, when yields go up, prices go down. Now the fireman's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1540.7s	1540.7	 pension is like, oh, my gosh, we just lost all this money, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1543.2s	1543.2	 never thought we were going to lose. And we're long all these,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1546.8s	1546.8	 you know, crazy tech stocks. And so then they're forced to sell,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1550.6s	1550.6	 so that their overall exposure goes down. That's called
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1553.1s	1553.1	 degrossing. Okay. And we've been going through a very painful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1557.6s	1557.6	 process of this degrossing hedge funds are doing it in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1561.9s	1561.9	 droves. Can I ask you a question then, Truma? I'm sorry to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1564.4s	1564.4	 interrupt, but should they not have looked at these multiples
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1568.4s	1568.4	 and said, you know what, maybe this one's out of whack, and I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1572.4s	1572.4	 should buy the ones that are not as out of whack because this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1575.4s	1575.4	 is not really because for the last 15 years, if you had, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1579.6s	1579.6	 know, the problem with being a value investor over the last 15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1582.6s	1582.6	 years since 2008 is you're basically a dumpster diver. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1586.6s	1586.6	 you got paid absolutely, you know, you didn't make anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1590.2s	1590.2	 because, because they misunderstood what value was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1592.9s	1592.9	 value isn't necessarily things that are cheap value is things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1596.0s	1596.0	 that are things that are valuable. And over the last 15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1599.9s	1599.9	 or 20 years, what was once a question is now definitive, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1604.1s	1604.1	 is that the things that are valuable tend to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1605.8s	1605.8	 technological, because they're super high margin, they grow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1609.0s	1609.0	 really quickly, they compound, they create enormous cash flows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1612.2s	1612.2	 at scale. So the point the point is, you couldn't own that stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1616.7s	1616.7	 And if you sat on the sidelines, you weren't meeting your 8%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1619.9s	1619.9	 hurdle, you were all of a sudden looking at some risk of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1622.7s	1622.7	 defaulting on your pension obligations. So this is how this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1626.2s	1626.2	 whole cycle brought us to today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1627.9s	1627.9	 There was nowhere what you're saying is, if I can summarize,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1629.8s	1629.8	 there was nowhere else for them to put their money, sacks price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1632.5s	1632.5	 matters, though. So is this just bad capital allocation, people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1636.0s	1636.0	 weren't thinking about the entry price of their investments?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1639.3s	1639.3	 We're giving too much credit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1640.7s	1640.7	 Well, I think I think what happened is that you had a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1643.0s	1643.0	 liquidity fueled boom going on. So what we've seen over the past
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1647.7s	1647.7	 four or five weeks, about the first week in November, most the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1651.0s	1651.0	 market basically peaked, and at least growth stocks did and SaaS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1654.8s	1654.8	 companies did. If you look kind of November 8 was sort of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1657.7s	1657.7	 beginning of the downturn. And since then, most of these growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1661.2s	1661.2	 stocks are down about 30% plus crypto is down now. I mean, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1665.9s	1665.9	 sliding as we speak 30 40% off a off a peak around the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1671.2s	1671.2	 What happened around the first week in November? Well, you had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1673.4s	1673.4	 three Fed governors come out and make very hawkish statements
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1676.8s	1676.8	 about the fact that the Fed was going to need to double the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1679.8s	1679.8	 speed of its taper. And then you're going to have two to three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1682.0s	1682.0	 rate increases next year. And so basically, we went from being in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1686.0s	1686.0	 a low interest rate environment, which has been the case, not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1689.1s	1689.1	 only just low interest rate environment, low interest rates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1691.1s	1691.1	 with massive stimulus and pumping out of Washington by both
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1695.0s	1695.0	 the Fed and by by Congress, okay. And so you went from that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1700.4s	1700.4	 environment to all of a sudden an environment of now we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1703.1s	1703.1	 expecting to have rate increases. And that's going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1706.1s	1706.1	 suck the liquidity out of the system. The the amazing thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1709.2s	1709.2	 that I'm seeing right now is that every investor I know is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1712.4s	1712.4	 having the same conversation. It doesn't matter whether you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1715.0s	1715.0	 a SaaS investor or a real estate investor, or crypto investor,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1718.9s	1718.9	 they're all having the same conversation, which is what are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1721.7s	1721.7	 interest rates going to do? How much liquidity is that going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1724.0s	1724.0	 suck out of the system? And how much of the boom that we've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1726.8s	1726.8	 experienced over the last couple of years has been because of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1730.1s	1730.1	 this unnatural liquidity that's been pumped into the system. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1733.0s	1733.0	 so I've never seen it I've never seen it be the case that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1737.1s	1737.1	 investors across every asset category are having that macro
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1740.9s	1740.9	 conversation, as opposed to talking about like micro stuff,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1744.6s	1744.6	 right? Like the specific company, the product who they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1747.9s	1747.9	 beating the market share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1749.2s	1749.2	 Nobody's talking about that. Like what building do I buy or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1751.7s	1751.7	 what SaaS can I invest in? It's all about what is happening in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1755.2s	1755.2	 the macro picture. And this is where I think what Biden is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1758.0s	1758.0	 doing is so unbelievably off base is, okay, look, he didn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1763.0s	1763.0	 start trillion dollar deficits. You know, that happened to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1766.5s	1766.5	 previous president. I'm not saying that was good. But, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1769.7s	1769.7	 now what we have is a situation here of, of the Fed is getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1774.7s	1774.7	 extremely hawkish of tightening. We're seeing inflation now out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1778.5s	1778.5	 of control. And yet there's been no adjustment whatsoever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1781.6s	1781.6	 Nobody can we just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1783.6s	1783.6	 nobody's hitting the brakes, right? Let's just let's just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1785.8s	1785.8	 call let's just call a spade a spade at this point, because I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1788.4s	1788.4	 think we can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1790.7s	1790.7	 I think, I think Biden was is and will ever be a really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1796.0s	1796.0	 moderate, down the middle centrist. I don't think there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1799.9s	1799.9	 ever been an extreme bone in that man's body. He has always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1802.7s	1802.7	 come off like, you know, the word that I think what I've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1805.3s	1805.3	 always thought of Biden, even now is equanimity, the guy is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1808.3s	1808.3	 really down the middle person. He's not an extreme individual.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1812.3s	1812.3	 I think that's the only kind of personality, by the way, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1815.4s	1815.4	 could have thrived for eight years as a VP with Obama and had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1818.3s	1818.3	 been in every room in every meeting. The problem, Sachs, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1823.2s	1823.2	 tell me if you think this is totally off base is that there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1826.0s	1826.0	 was a head fake after he won the presidency, where there was this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1830.2s	1830.2	 fake lurch to the progressive left. And it turned out that it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1834.5s	1834.5	 was a complete head fake, because that whole cohort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1837.1s	1837.1	 people just totally jumped the shark. Because all that rhetoric
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1840.6s	1840.6	 then unfortunately turned out to be not worth much, it started to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1843.9s	1843.9	 blow up in their face in every single election that's happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1846.6s	1846.6	 since then, at the local level in cities at the state level in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1850.4s	1850.4	 places like Virginia. And in the middle of all of that, I actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1854.3s	1854.3	 think what happened was that faction tried to push an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1857.8s	1857.8	 extremely aggressive legislative agenda to paint Biden as an ex
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1861.8s	1861.8	 Roosevelt, which maybe he didn't even have the desire to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1865.7s	1865.7	 because I think that he seems a very low ego kind of person. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1869.9s	1869.9	 now we're actually realizing, oh, my gosh, this makes no sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1872.6s	1872.6	 And so the part of why I think the markets are kind of like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1876.2s	1876.2	 hand wringing is you would expect at this point, the federal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1880.2s	1880.2	 bureaucracy to actually step in. But I think there's like a real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1884.0s	1884.0	 lack of confidence because for example, today, when there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1887.0s	1887.0	 CPI print of somewhere between seven and 10%, the only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1892.8s	1892.8	 democratic sounding, you know, the talking point was one of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1896.6s	1896.6	 squad proposing a four day work week. I mean, right, that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1901.0s	1901.0	 insane. That you're in crazy debt. And you're like, guys, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1905.2s	1905.2	 should spend more money and work less. When the CEO says we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1908.8s	1908.8	 about to go three more trillion into debt. The solution isn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1913.3s	1913.3	 default. Well, it's, I actually think if you want to work less,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1916.8s	1916.8	 work less, you know, maybe you're lucky, and your boomer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1919.7s	1919.7	 parents can give you money. But there's a bunch of us like me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1922.2s	1922.2	 who had to grind. I didn't have anybody to fall back on. And if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1924.8s	1924.8	 you all of a sudden pass the law, that's at HMF, you can only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1928.0s	1928.0	 work four days a week, I would be really angry. Because you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1931.5s	1931.5	 depriving me of 20% more of a chance to beat all those other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1935.8s	1935.8	 soft candy asses that went to all those fancy schools that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1939.0s	1939.0	 weren't willing to work. Yeah, ignore. That's a stupid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1941.8s	1941.8	 assumption. Me work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1943.4s	1943.4	 So I think I think this this proposal that came out to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1946.3s	1946.3	 basically this was a new proposal that they were going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1948.6s	1948.6	 to limit the work week to four days a week. When let people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1952.2s	1952.2	 work five days a week. The reason why it's well, it's a bad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1955.7s	1955.7	 idea in general, but it's a particularly sort of a brain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1959.6s	1959.6	 dead idea to propose during a height you serve this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1962.7s	1962.7	 inflationary period, because again, inflation is caused by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1965.8s	1965.8	 too much money chasing too few goods. Well, so you have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1968.6s	1968.6	 demand component from the pumping and the stimulus. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1971.4s	1971.4	 you also have the supply component, which is we don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1973.1s	1973.1	 have enough goods and services. Why? Because we've been, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1975.8s	1975.8	 know, passing out these STEMI checks that disincentivize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1979.3s	1979.3	 people from working, we have problems with the ports, we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1982.2s	1982.2	 these COVID restrictions have all gone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1984.0s	1984.0	 restaurants are closing three days a week as they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1986.1s	1986.1	 Right. So we've had a shortage. So we've had a shortage of goods
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1988.7s	1988.7	 and services. The last thing we need is a 20% reduction in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1992.9s	1992.9	 number of work days or work hours that are available. So it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1995.8s	1995.8	 just shows like how out of touch these progressives are but look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=1999.7s	1999.7	 to your mouth to your point about Biden, I look I don't know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2004.3s	2004.3	 you know, exactly what's in Biden's heart. To me, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2006.5s	2006.5	 doesn't really matter. I think I actually think he's pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2009.8s	2009.8	 liberal. He's not all the way out to where you know, AOC is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2015.0s	2015.0	 fine, fair enough. But look, at the end of the day, I think you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2018.4s	2018.4	 know, this idea of Biden being a moderate, you know, moderate is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2022.0s	2022.0	 as moderate does he has not governed like a moderate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2024.7s	2024.7	 whether that's because, you know, this moderate thing was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2027.7s	2027.7	 just a marketing shtick on his part, and he's actually more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2030.6s	2030.6	 liberal or whether he's been co-opted and taken over by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2033.0s	2033.0	 progressives. I don't really care what the reason is. The fact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2035.8s	2035.8	 of the matter is he is not governed like a moderate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2037.7s	2037.7	 We pull back the spending. I mean, the spend we have not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2040.2s	2040.2	 pulled back the spend. Well, no, no, no, the original. Remember
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2042.6s	2042.6	 the original?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2045.6s	2045.6	 We just loaded that we put the bullet in the chamber and loaded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2048.3s	2048.3	 for mansion. This bill is not going to happen, David, with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2050.8s	2050.8	 $3 trillion deficit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2052.0s	2052.0	 I hope not. I mean, the point is that it look if people like us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2056.6s	2056.6	 don't speak up and say this is a reckless pump. Yes, exactly. Then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2061.9s	2061.9	 you can only fly the plane so fast before the wings come off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2065.8s	2065.8	 This is too much speed for the airframe. Let's go to a clip of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2069.5s	2069.5	 our friend Elon talking. Let's go to this clip of Elon talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2073.5s	2073.5	 about capital allocation. It's a couple of it's like 30 seconds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2076.8s	2076.8	 and then Friedberg I'd like you to comment on the other side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2078.6s	2078.6	 Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2079.4s	2079.4	 At some point, really what you're doing is capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2081.7s	2081.7	 allocation. So you're not it's not money for personal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2085.8s	2085.8	 expenditures. It's what you're doing is capital allocation. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2088.7s	2088.7	 it does not make sense to take the job of capital allocation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2093.6s	2093.6	 from people who have demonstrated great skill in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2095.6s	2095.6	 capital allocation and give it to you know, an entity that has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2100.0s	2100.0	 demonstrated very poor skill in capital allocation, which is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2103.2s	2103.2	 government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2103.7s	2103.7	 Yeah, Friedberg your thoughts on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2107.0s	2107.0	 I've said it in the past.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2110.3s	2110.3	 This is at a Wall Street Journal Conference, by the way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2112.7s	2112.7	 you can think of a government or a nonprofit or a corporation as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2121.3s	2121.3	 an organism as a living organism and each living organism wants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2125.6s	2125.6	 to eat and grow. And there is no such thing as an organism that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2130.8s	2130.8	 says over time, I want to shrink and shrivel away and die. So the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2136.2s	2136.2	 organizing principle of the people in the government is to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2139.8s	2139.8	 do more for their constituents for their owners, which are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2143.1s	2143.1	 what they believe to be the taxpayers or their or their, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2146.0s	2146.0	 know, the folks that elected them to office. The politicians
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2150.0s	2150.0	 themselves, I would argue are more actors in the Ouija board of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2153.3s	2153.3	 behavior that's going on here. And you know, less kind of, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2157.2s	2157.2	 know, the the mental designer of a system that they're trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2160.0s	2160.0	 use to infiltrate change in the world individually, and conquer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2163.4s	2163.4	 and gain individual power, there may be some degree of motivation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2165.9s	2165.9	 there. But I think largely, it's more about the fact that that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2168.4s	2168.4	 organism that government wants to grow wants to spend more wants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2172.7s	2172.7	 to do more over time, not less. And this is true of any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2176.3s	2176.3	 business, every business wants to grow, if you're not growing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2178.6s	2178.6	 you're dying. And every nonprofit, there's no such thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2181.8s	2181.8	 as a nonprofit that says, let's not fundraise, and let's spend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2184.2s	2184.2	 all our money and then shut down. And so I just think like, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2187.6s	2187.6	 know, as much as we want to kind of sit here and rationalize a way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2190.2s	2190.2	 to better politicians that are going to better serve us, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2193.0s	2193.0	 are going to think smarter. The reality is every government,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2196.7s	2196.7	 every, you know, institution of government in the history of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2200.0s	2200.0	 humankind has tried to grow. And eventually, they cycle back, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2204.3s	2204.3	 know, the United States, like I said last year, you know, maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2207.4s	2207.4	 kind of going out with with a little bit of a whimper, less of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2210.7s	2210.7	 a bang. And that's going to, you know, be a function of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2213.6s	2213.6	 devaluation of currency or, you know, having less of a place in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2216.6s	2216.6	 the in the global stage, and so on. But I think Elon's right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2221.3s	2221.3	 like, you know, he feels and many people in business feel like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2225.2s	2225.2	 they're in competition with the government for capital. And,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2230.1s	2230.1	 yeah, yeah. And that that capital is the only difference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2233.4s	2233.4	 is that the government can force that capital can force that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2235.7s	2235.7	 revenue. And, and no business can. And so they've got an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2240.2s	2240.2	 unfair advantage in that in that, that stage of playing for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2244.1s	2244.1	 capital. And this is where you know, Bitcoin feels to a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2246.8s	2246.8	 people like a great equalizer. And I'm not a big I'm not a huge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2249.9s	2249.9	 like I'm not a Bitcoin maximalist or anything. But I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2252.3s	2252.3	 think that's where the appeal arises, which is, you know, as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2255.6s	2255.6	 Jefferson said, like every generation needs a revolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2259.6s	2259.6	 And I think that this is the revolution that folks are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2261.8s	2261.8	 looking for, which is how do we get this big monopolistic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2265.4s	2265.4	 player off the playing field to let us do what we want to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2268.9s	2268.9	 Well, I mean, it's so easy. I mean, all Biden has to do is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2272.0s	2272.0	 what he was elected to. He never had a mandate for this $10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2274.5s	2274.5	 trillion of spending. I mean, the guy ran a basement campaign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2277.3s	2277.3	 I mean, his he was elected to not be Trump. Okay, he was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2280.8s	2280.8	 elected to stop the chaos not Yeah, not not to engage this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2284.5s	2284.5	 $10 trillion adults progressive agenda. You know, Elon, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2289.6s	2289.6	 made a really good point about the capital allocation there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2291.6s	2291.6	 you know, people think, okay, he wants got all this money. So he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2294.8s	2294.8	 must be enjoying this like incredible lifestyle. Look, he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2297.8s	2297.8	 right that once you have that much money, you can't spend it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2301.5s	2301.5	 all on personal consumption, you invest it. And so the question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2304.7s	2304.7	 is, who's going to make that investment is who's gonna be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2306.8s	2306.8	 better at it, Elon, or the federal government, we know Elon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2310.3s	2310.3	 is better at it. He creates incredible innovations, he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2313.3s	2313.3	 going to put people on Mars, I mean, he can do incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2316.4s	2316.4	 things with that capital, a million, just squanders it, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2319.5s	2319.5	 know, there's another Elon, another really good, I think he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2322.4s	2322.4	 actually understands economics at a macro level really well. He
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2326.5s	2326.5	 had a really good, there's an equally good snippet of him on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2329.1s	2329.1	 the Rogan show. You know, plenty, plenty, plenty, where he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2334.3s	2334.3	 says, Look, there's a lot of people out there, who think the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2337.0s	2337.0	 economy is just like this hornet plenty that produces all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2339.8s	2339.8	 goods, and the goods is magically appear no matter what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2342.7s	2342.7	 we do. Okay. And so if some people have more goods than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2345.7s	2345.7	 others, it's just because they stole them from the hornet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2348.2s	2348.2	 plenty. What he asked, but he said is, No, this is not the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2351.0s	2351.0	 the economy works, people actually have to make the stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2353.8s	2353.8	 You know, if people don't make the stuff, there is no stuff,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2356.1s	2356.1	 okay, this stuff doesn't just magically appear. And the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2359.3s	2359.3	 the stuff gets made is you have people making smart capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2362.6s	2362.6	 allocation decisions, and engaging in hard work. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2365.6s	2365.6	 that's what actually produces the stuff. And it's not a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2368.2s	2368.2	 zero sum game. So if you think about like this agenda that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2371.8s	2371.8	 have in Washington, it really flips this on its head, it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2375.5s	2375.5	 doing everything it can to stop the production of the stuff,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2378.8s	2378.8	 whether it's the STEMI checks or the COVID lockdowns or, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2384.0s	2384.0	 know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2384.2s	2384.2	 bonus unemployment, extenuating the earnings of people so that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2390.0s	2390.0	 they can spend it on whatever they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2392.7s	2392.7	 Exactly. It's actually, it's actually putting constraints on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2396.6s	2396.6	 the production on the supply of the stuff. And then, meanwhile,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2400.9s	2400.9	 it's just printing all this money. So then we wonder, where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2403.5s	2403.5	 does the inflation come from? Well, obviously, it's coming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2405.3s	2405.3	 from printing more money for fewer goods. That's, that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2408.9s	2408.9	 basically the problem with the agenda we have in Washington
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2411.1s	2411.1	 right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2412.3s	2412.3	 The increase in the deficit is just getting stunning. If you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2416.6s	2416.6	 look back on the five or six last presidents, Reagan 142%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2421.6s	2421.6	 increase, he got us up to 1.42 trillion, he had to obviously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2425.9s	2425.9	 combat what happened under Jimmy Carter, George Bush, George HW
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2429.7s	2429.7	 Bush, 30% 36% increase. President Bill Clinton, a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2435.1s	2435.1	 1% decrease the first time we've had a stimulus, I'm sorry,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2438.2s	2438.2	 a surplus in a long time, and then Bush, the second 57%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2442.3s	2442.3	 increase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2443.0s	2443.0	 The economic results under Bill Clinton were amazing. I've been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2445.4s	2445.4	 amazing. I was just about to say he's a goat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2447.6s	2447.6	 Yeah, but I mean, at the time, what was very interesting is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2450.2s	2450.2	 politicians actually took this issue of balancing the budget
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2453.6s	2453.6	 very seriously, seriously, deadly seriously, and thinking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2457.0s	2457.0	 about how we would pay for things. And now we don't seem to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2460.6s	2460.6	 think about who is going to pay for these things. Yes, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2464.2s	2464.2	 going to screw our children.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2466.2s	2466.2	 Okay, so you have to remember that Bill Clinton was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2469.0s	2469.0	 president who said the era of big government is over. And when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2471.6s	2471.6	 he left office, he actually bragged about reducing the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2474.7s	2474.7	 federal government share of the economy from 22% to 18 and a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2478.4s	2478.4	 half percent, you would never hear a democratic president
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2481.8s	2481.8	 will never happen again, you'll never hear a democratic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2483.4s	2483.4	 president. Well, first of all, they wouldn't do it. But second,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2485.6s	2485.6	 they wouldn't brag about it. You know, you can't even say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2488.1s	2488.1	 something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2490.3s	2490.3	 Let me ask you, do you think a Republican president would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2492.6s	2492.6	 because I'm not convinced that any party matters at this point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2495.2s	2495.2	 it feels to me, like the incentive structure is such that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2499.9s	2499.9	 the individuals who are representing constituents who get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2502.2s	2502.2	 them elected, and they can pass more dollars back to those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2504.6s	2504.6	 constituents, drives a systemic model of growth for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2508.2s	2508.2	 government. And therefore, the government is completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2510.5s	2510.5	 competing as a monopoly on the field for capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2513.5s	2513.5	 Yeah, look, I think you thought Trump was going to be this guy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2517.2s	2517.2	 and Trump came in, and he ended up spending more and I recognize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2520.1s	2520.1	 they were extenuating circumstances and so on. But I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2522.1s	2522.1	 thought he was going to go in, I thought the premise was blow up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2524.6s	2524.6	 the government, you know, cut all this nonsense and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2527.0s	2527.0	 deficit kind of shot up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2528.8s	2528.8	 You're right that Republicans have a very spotty record on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2533.8s	2533.8	 government spending. And we did have trillion dollar deficits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2536.5s	2536.5	 pre COVID under Trump. And that was not that was not good. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2540.4s	2540.4	 what Biden is doing now in the face of inflation is worse. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2545.3s	2545.3	 look, I mean, historically, the best, the only times that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2550.5s	2550.5	 really have, it seems like fiscal responsibility is when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2554.7s	2554.7	 you actually have the best track records have been when you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2557.2s	2557.2	 Democratic presidents, Republican Congresses, and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2559.6s	2559.6	 Republicans suddenly find their principles on spending when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2562.2s	2562.2	 there's a Democrat in the White House. You're right that when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2565.5s	2565.5	 Trump was in office and had Congress and George W. Bush, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2569.7s	2569.7	 know, had Congress, Republicans spent a lot of money too. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2571.9s	2571.9	 it's absolutely a bipartisan problem. But what's happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2574.8s	2574.8	 now in Washington is under Biden is is unprecedented is a breaking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2579.6s	2579.6	 of the bank, they're talking about minting trillion dollar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2581.8s	2581.8	 coins. So yes, it was a problem under Republicans, but this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2584.8s	2584.8	 even worse. And here's another thing is the Fed is now saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2588.6s	2588.6	 that they're projecting two to three rate increases next year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2591.7s	2591.7	 So let's call that 75 basis points, multiply that by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2594.7s	2594.7	 close to 30 trillion of government debt that you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2596.7s	2596.7	 talking about, Jason, that's about 150 billion a year of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2600.2s	2600.2	 interest payments on the debt of debt service. Okay, 150 extra
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2604.4s	2604.4	 extra that doesn't exist today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2605.6s	2605.6	 It's not fixed rate, by the way, this is short term rates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2608.4s	2608.4	 It's all short term rates, because yes, so so you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2611.3s	2611.3	 looking 150 billion of incremental debt service costs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2614.8s	2614.8	 right? So multiply that over 10 years, that's 1.5 trillion over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2618.9s	2618.9	 10 years. That's your build back better right there. Where's this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2621.6s	2621.6	 money for build back better going to come from? We have 1.5

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2628.4s	2628.4	 And how do we get the cycle of people wanting to go back to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2632.9s	2632.9	 work and be productive? It feels to me like this could be wages,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2637.0s	2637.0	 which is what's happening, but people are still not going back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2639.0s	2639.0	 to work. Have you been watching that? That's the offering $70,000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2643.4s	2643.4	 to be a manager of a Taco Bell and people understand? Well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2646.6s	2646.6	 then offer 75,000 I still don't think they fell it. No, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2650.1s	2650.1	 I think I think I think that model is dead. I think low cost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2653.8s	2653.8	 labor is inevitably the cost if they're making $75,000 in order
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2659.4s	2659.4	 for people to function. I don't think labor but taco bell is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2663.9s	2663.9	 going to sell burritos if they cost $6. So if they're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2666.6s	2666.6	 have to raise labor costs, people aren't going to be buying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2669.0s	2669.0	 Taco Bell, they're going to go somewhere else. So the low cost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2671.8s	2671.8	 model of consumerism in the United States, which has been a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2674.4s	2674.4	 stronghold for our economy for 100 years at this point, may be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2678.3s	2678.3	 coming to an end or it will accelerate the implementation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2681.6s	2681.6	 of automation across that sector of the economy. And that's what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2684.0s	2684.0	 happening. That's more likely. That's more likely. By the way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2687.3s	2687.3	 one of the if you read the press release for the four days a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2690.0s	2690.0	 week, I pay for Taco Bell burrito, the gobbledygooks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2694.2s	2694.2	 in the four days a week thing. It said workers for far too long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2698.4s	2698.4	 have been forced to work very long hours and not get paid. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2703.4s	2703.4	 wait, they were not paid. And so the idea is just like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2707.4s	2707.4	 opt out. But then if you opt out, you'll make even less. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2711.8s	2711.8	 In a moment where you can actually make more. Yeah, these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2714.5s	2714.5	 idiots who are coming up with these ideas, the Chinese must be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2718.0s	2718.0	 looking at these buys out record the American economy. Oh my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2723.8s	2723.8	 terms of it turns out we'll need to do anything. We're destroying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2726.6s	2726.6	 it from the inside. Exactly. So just just in terms of what we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2728.9s	2728.9	 should do here, I actually think there's a lot of strength in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2731.1s	2731.1	 economy right now. It's not all negative. I mean, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2733.5s	2733.5	 unemployment rate is down to four and a half percent. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2736.2s	2736.2	 labor participation rate. Yeah, it's quite low. I mean, it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2740.1s	2740.1	 three and a half percent before COVID. So we're getting close to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2742.5s	2742.5	 where we were before COVID. The labor participation rate is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2745.0s	2745.0	 great. I think it's like 61% salary 63. It was 63% for COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2749.2s	2749.2	 So we need to get more people working. We could do that by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2752.0s	2752.0	 ending the STEMI checks. Okay. But the most important thing we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2755.1s	2755.1	 could do right now is imagine we do Biden the biggest favor by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2758.7s	2758.7	 just putting a bullet in this Build Back Better plan because I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2761.5s	2761.5	 actually think there'd be a massive relief rally and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2764.2s	2764.2	 economy would take off like a rocket next year. If you just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2767.0s	2767.0	 got government out of the way they have printed enough that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2770.1s	2770.1	 the best thing that could happen is they stop this pumping and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2772.7s	2772.7	 stimulus. And then the Fed doesn't have to raise rates as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2775.6s	2775.6	 aggressively next year. And we could let things have more of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2778.8s	2778.8	 soft landing, as opposed to the sudden austerity, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2782.4s	2782.4	 whipsawing the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2784.3s	2784.3	 So just slow the plane down and then break this bell into 20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2788.3s	2788.3	 component parts and just try to get a couple of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2791.0s	2791.0	 All the money he spent all the money. It's spent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2793.8s	2793.8	 I mean, this is a bender of all benders. And if people are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2796.2s	2796.2	 refusing to go back to work, we're gonna have to we talked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2798.5s	2798.5	 about this in the last episode, we're gonna have to think about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2800.4s	2800.4	 generalization. Jason, I think it's a generalization to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2803.3s	2803.3	 people refuse to go back to work. I think the jobs that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2805.5s	2805.5	 people had when when their options open up to them, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2809.0s	2809.0	 know, may not be jobs they want to go back to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2810.6s	2810.6	 Correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2811.1s	2811.1	 And I think that there's going to be a larger, significant growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2814.5s	2814.5	 in a services economy that didn't exist before. Think about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2817.4s	2817.4	 how many yoga instructors there are today that didn't exist 20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2820.2s	2820.2	 years ago. How many you know, people doing creators, YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2823.9s	2823.9	 creators, creators, the creator, the creator economy alone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2826.9s	2826.9	 right? Like Hollywood no longer has a monopoly on content. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2829.8s	2829.8	 people are spending more time consuming content than ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2832.0s	2832.0	 before. So you know, there's a services economy that I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2834.9s	2834.9	 think we really predicted or modeled and we all assume Oh my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2837.3s	2837.3	 god, we're not going to know what's going back to work. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2839.6s	2839.6	 like, guess what people are spending money, and they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2841.4s	2841.4	 going to spend money on new stuff. And these new industries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2843.4s	2843.4	 are going to emerge. We know creators and those creators are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2846.0s	2846.0	 going to create jobs around them. You know, one amazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2848.6s	2848.6	 creator will hire 100 people to, you know, staff his videos and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2852.2s	2852.2	 make his music and edit his stuff and you know, run his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2854.4s	2854.4	 business and so on. Like it's just, it's just the way that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2857.2s	2857.2	 economy shifts. There's been a moment here that is like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2860.0s	2860.0	 Cambrian explosion of new species of industry, where you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2864.8s	2864.8	 know, this meteorite of COVID came and hit planet Earth, there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2869.2s	2869.2	 was an eradication of the old species, you know, minimum wage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2872.1s	2872.1	 jobs for crappy labor work that people don't want to do. And all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2874.8s	2874.8	 of a sudden, the sun came out and new stuff is emerging and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2877.4s	2877.4	 new life forms are emerging new jobs are emerging. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2880.0s	2880.0	 we're just we're going through a really ugly transitory period.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2882.7s	2882.7	 But I think like like Sac said, it could be really great on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2886.2s	2886.2	 other side. And there's also Yeah, sorry, there's one more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2888.6s	2888.6	 argument to be made, which is our friend, Brad Gerstner,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2891.5s	2891.5	 sent me a note today saying, I know you guys are going to rant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2893.4s	2893.4	 on your all in pod today about inflation, I want to remind you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2896.0s	2896.0	 about the deflationary effect of technology, and it is really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2899.4s	2899.4	 being felt in the economy, I think we all see it how software
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2902.4s	2902.4	 alone can reduce the operating costs and the labor costs of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2905.1s	2905.1	 businesses, drive up margins, increase growth. And so you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2908.6s	2908.6	 know, there's a number of tailwinds here. But I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2911.4s	2911.4	 Sachs is right, there's a masking going on with respect to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2913.8s	2913.8	 the capital that's just being bandied about right now. And it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2917.2s	2917.2	 it's a risky, nasty kind of, you know, maelstrom of a of a sea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2921.9s	2921.9	 we're trying to cross right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2923.3s	2923.3	 I want to point out two positive things to build on saxes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2926.6s	2926.6	 positivity. Number one, I don't know if you guys are following
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2930.1s	2930.1	 Omicron in the UK. They have record cases right now, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2934.4s	2934.4	 deaths, and they're also done great with the vaccine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2937.2s	2937.2	 obviously, small country with a lot of resources. So they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2940.5s	2940.5	 hitting record cases for this last cycle. But deaths and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2944.1s	2944.1	 hospitalizations are down and they say upward 2550% is part is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2948.4s	2948.4	 now moved to Omicron and it seems like that this could be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2954.1s	2954.1	 the end game, maybe and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2957.0s	2957.0	 did you ever see the the end of was it outbreak where they like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2960.2s	2960.2	 dropped that bomb and it was like the massive bomb that takes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2962.5s	2962.5	 all the air out of the room is like shock shocks everything and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2965.1s	2965.1	 then they're like, okay, it's over. You know, there could be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2967.4s	2967.4	 this thing happening where Omicron is the you know, the the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2970.2s	2970.2	 air bomb that gets dropped, clears the room and then it's all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2973.6s	2973.6	 over, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2974.3s	2974.3	 well, and then here's the other thing that we don't know, I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2976.4s	2976.4	 seeing the salaries going up faster than inflation, people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2979.6s	2979.6	 are raising people's salaries, you know, in double digits to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2983.5s	2983.5	 try to get them to come to these jobs. So the people who are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2985.4s	2985.4	 choosing to go back to work and people are eventually choosing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2988.2s	2988.2	 that and switching jobs to Trimont's point, I think they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2991.4s	2991.4	 gonna be making more money. And they're gonna be more resilient
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2995.2s	2995.2	 and they are going to be a little more empowered. And that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=2997.5s	2997.5	 could end up being a great thing. And then finally, in terms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3000.8s	3000.8	 of technology, I have one robotic company that serves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3004.1s	3004.1	 coffee and they had a record week, bump it, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3011.4s	3011.4	 they broke $11,000. And people ordering from a robotic coffee
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3016.9s	3016.9	 machine. Previously, the record was like seven K a week. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3020.4s	3020.4	 people tell your stupid lady friend I have an $11,000 sweater.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3025.7s	3025.7	 Please stop it. Stop it. All right, listen, I don't know if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3029.8s	3029.8	 you guys saw this better calm layoffs viral video, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3034.8s	3034.8	 it can you break this down? J Cal ahead? I wasn't not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3037.6s	3037.6	 following this. Very simple. There's a company called better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3040.3s	3040.3	 calm. They get rid of origination fees or whatever and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3043.5s	3043.5	 commissions. They try to get you faster mortgages, insurance,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3045.9s	3045.9	 whatever. They were gonna stack. Softbank was gonna put in 1.5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3050.2s	3050.2	 billion in the pipe. Everything was going according to it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3052.8s	3052.8	 already in the company, right? So they were trying to get their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3054.5s	3054.5	 own company out. Yeah. So obviously, the market corrects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3059.6s	3059.6	 everybody always asks us as a group what happens when the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3061.9s	3061.9	 market corrects? Well, here, you're about to see it. This
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3064.1s	3064.1	 guy decides I got to cut 10% of the company instead of having
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3067.0s	3067.0	 his managers go to each group and have a logical small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3071.3s	3071.3	 discussion about how they're going to correct things and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3073.4s	3073.4	 maybe some sort of thoughtful process he decides he's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3076.3s	3076.3	 to get on zoom to the entire 900 people were fired. And in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3081.9s	3081.9	 very bizarre, 9900 people, 900 people, but over zoom, over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3086.7s	3086.7	 zoom, how big is this company 10,000 employees. And he says
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3090.9s	3090.9	 to them, that the last time I had to do this, I laid people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3094.4s	3094.4	 off, I was I cried, and I'm going to try to do better this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3097.2s	3097.2	 time. But if you are on this call, effective immediately,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3100.4s	3100.4	 you're fired. It's just another one of these crazy clips we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3103.2s	3103.2	 have to see it 30 seconds to mouth. Give me your thoughts on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3106.2s	3106.2	 this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3107.3s	3107.3	 Thank you for joining. I come to you with not great news. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3112.1s	3112.1	 market has changed, as you know, and we have to move with it in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3118.8s	3118.8	 order to survive so that hopefully we can continue to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3121.9s	3121.9	 thrive and deliver on a mission. This isn't news that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3124.2s	3124.2	 you're going to want to hear. But ultimately, it was my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3127.4s	3127.4	 decision. And I wanted you to hear from me. It's been a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3131.1s	3131.1	 really, really challenging decision to make. This is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3134.0s	3134.0	 second time in my career, I'm doing this and I do not do not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3137.8s	3137.8	 want to do this. The last time I did it, I cried this time I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3141.3s	3141.3	 hope to be stronger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3142.3s	3142.3	 Okay, and then here's the second clip where he basically tells
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3145.9s	3145.9	 everybody over zoom that you're not going to be able to log in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3150.0s	3150.0	 and you got two weeks, sevens, three weeks before a month
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3152.5s	3152.5	 severance and it's like three weeks before Christmas. Go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3154.6s	3154.6	 ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3154.8s	3154.8	 We are laying off about 15% of the company, the market,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3162.5s	3162.5	 efficiency, and performances and productivity. If you're on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3167.2s	3167.2	 call, you are part of the unlucky group. You do is being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3172.1s	3172.1	 laid off. Your employment here is terminated, effective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3175.8s	3175.8	 immediately. Are you kidding me? What does this mean for what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3179.4s	3179.4	 next? You're going to get an email from HR ask HR at better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3183.0s	3183.0	 calm to your personal email address.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3186.6s	3186.6	 Of your severance and your benefits for all us employees,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3190.6s	3190.6	 we're providing four weeks of severance, one month of full
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3194.2s	3194.2	 benefits and two months of Cobra for which we will pay the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3197.8s	3197.8	 premium. So three months total benefits if you like for Cobra.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3202.0s	3202.0	 All right. I mean, for we've all operated business before. I've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3207.3s	3207.3	 had to do layouts before it is the most fucking brutal thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3210.4s	3210.4	 Yeah, this is the exact wrong way to do it though. Terrible. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3213.6s	3213.6	 remember an a well right way to do it. But I think the question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3216.3s	3216.3	 with this guy is to examine you know, the growth incentive that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3220.4s	3220.4	 got him to this point. He took SoftBank money. SoftBank as you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3224.2s	3224.2	 guys as we all know, creates a very strong incentive and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3228.0s	3228.0	 capitalizes businesses to go after kind of ultra perhaps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3231.3s	3231.3	 unnatural growth. And there's almost always shocks that occur
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3235.6s	3235.6	 after they do that. And the circumstance I think could have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3239.0s	3239.0	 been avoided maybe built a business a little more steady,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3241.0s	3241.0	 but then his valuation would have been lower and he wouldn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3242.8s	3242.8	 have been able to access as much capital. And so you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3245.6s	3245.6	 unfortunately, the loss of jobs is the cost of capital with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3249.0s	3249.0	 these ultra high growth incentives that are kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3251.3s	3251.3	 being structurally built into the fundraising rounds in these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3253.7s	3253.7	 later stage deals lately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3256.1s	3256.1	 I don't know if you guys agree, but it's just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3257.2s	3257.2	 Saks and then Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3258.6s	3258.6	 Okay, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3259.8s	3259.8	 how would you do this? Saks, you're an operator?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3261.8s	3261.8	 Yeah, I mean, so I've had to lay people off before, but never in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3266.1s	3266.1	 this era of COVID remote work. So the question and look, it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3269.8s	3269.8	 miserable. And I think that it is the right thing to do for him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3274.0s	3274.0	 to take responsibility if, if there if this restructuring was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3278.0s	3278.0	 caused by a strategy that was, you know, overly prioritized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3282.0s	3282.0	 growth, I think he could say something like, look, this is my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3284.8s	3284.8	 fault, the company's fault, you know, not your fault. So I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3288.5s	3288.5	 exactly, I think he could have couched that I think he could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3291.3s	3291.3	 take responsibility. That being said, I don't think he owed the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3295.1s	3295.1	 groveling apology that he was forced to make. Because, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3298.5s	3298.5	 here's the thing, how do you lay 900 people off in this era of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3301.6s	3301.6	 remote work? I mean, they're all working from home. There's no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3304.2s	3304.2	 office for them to go into, where you can sit them down one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3307.2s	3307.2	 on one like a human like you used to be able to do and have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3309.7s	3309.7	 conversation. So they are laying people off by zoom now. And it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3313.4s	3313.4	 unfortunate, but I think it's just this new world that we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3316.1s	3316.1	 in. And I don't know that there's a much better way to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3319.6s	3319.6	 this. I think the words could have been better. Maybe it could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3321.9s	3321.9	 have been more organized. But how do you lay off people who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3324.1s	3324.1	 are working from home?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3324.9s	3324.9	 I have an idea. But you're not let me let you go first. Any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3327.0s	3327.0	 thoughts? You want to add? I'll tell you how I would have done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3329.7s	3329.7	 it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3330.0s	3330.0	 I remember when I had to do my first layoff at at a well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3336.2s	3336.2	 Who are wanting them there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3337.7s	3337.7	 And there was a lot of those rifts. And I remember the first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3340.1s	3340.1	 one, I was in my early to mid 20s as a manager. And we had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3343.8s	3343.8	 three or four people or whatever. And I remember
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3346.0s	3346.0	 distinctly that AOL had this policy at the time, because I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3349.1s	3349.1	 guess they had maybe like better, like, 10s of 1000s of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3353.6s	3353.6	 people, employees, lots of call center, as an example, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3356.6s	3356.6	 they've had to have rifts before, they would have security
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3359.7s	3359.7	 guards, and there would be a security guard outside the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3362.2s	3362.2	 meeting room where you would bring somebody in and talk to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3364.4s	3364.4	 them. And I just remember being seared in my mind, because never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3367.3s	3367.3	 having done it before, I was like sweating profusely really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3370.2s	3370.2	 nervous, I didn't know what to say, I felt really bad, I felt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3373.9s	3373.9	 very guilty. And then you learn how to do these things. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3378.2s	3378.2	 there is a very humane way to try to do these things. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3380.8s	3380.8	 never the best thing to do. But you try to give people a fair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3384.1s	3384.1	 exit package and all of these things. Let me put that aside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3387.4s	3387.4	 because I think what Friedberg said is so good and so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3390.6s	3390.6	 important. The root cause of why this is here, as far as I can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3396.4s	3396.4	 tell, is not a company that doesn't have consumer demand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3402.6s	3402.6	 It's a company that may have been mismanaged for growth to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3405.6s	3405.6	 meet the consumer demand because of too much money. And this is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3410.0s	3410.0	 thing that is an avoidable mistake. And this is where you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3414.3s	3414.3	 have to figure out how much you want to basically swim with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3418.1s	3418.1	 tide and be like everybody else, which is to be able to go to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3421.6s	3421.6	 dinner party, say I raised x amount of dollars at y
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3424.2s	3424.2	 valuation and just keep ticking it up and taking it up. Or to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3428.2s	3428.2	 actually have the discipline to hit the brakes and say I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3430.9s	3430.9	 need it. I don't know what to do with it. I'm not ready to take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3433.8s	3433.8	 it. I need to figure out my business model. Those are two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3436.8s	3436.8	 different kinds of decisions. There's going to be layoffs in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3439.8s	3439.8	 both. But if he actually came at it from the perspective of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3444.9s	3444.9	 listen, guys, we've been growing methodically, and there's just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3447.3s	3447.3	 been a structural change, or for example, rates are ticking up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3450.8s	3450.8	 there's a lot less demand, and we have to right size the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3453.0s	3453.0	 company. That's a very different statement than maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3455.5s	3455.5	 we over grew, because we were drunk on free money. And now we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3460.2s	3460.2	 have to realize that we actually have too much capacity for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3463.5s	3463.5	 demand that actually exists. And those are avoidable mistakes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3467.2s	3467.2	 frankly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3467.6s	3467.6	 Yeah, I've had to do laughs. I have to say it's not fun. This
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3471.1s	3471.1	 was executed terribly. To your point, sacks. I think a much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3474.7s	3474.7	 easier way to do this would have been to go to the leaders in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3477.3s	3477.3	 each group and say, Hey, listen, we're going to have to do these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3479.5s	3479.5	 layoffs. It's going to affect different groups. So you take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3482.7s	3482.7	 your group into a subset of zoom, you explain to those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3485.6s	3485.6	 people, and you do it. Hey, listen, we are reorganizing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3489.4s	3489.4	 because of these reasons. Chamath had some good language
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3491.5s	3491.5	 there, other people did. But this idea of mass firing 900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3494.3s	3494.3	 people with right person, that's the critical area here. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3498.4s	3498.4	 either that's a little megalomaniacal. That's almost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3502.3s	3502.3	 like he wanted to talk about himself in this as taking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3506.1s	3506.1	 responsibility to unpack it. Obviously, when something like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3510.3s	3510.3	 this happens, then the floodgates open Forbes got a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3519.5s	3519.5	 in the email that's been leaked since this came out. You are cap

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3527.3s	3527.3	 dolphins get caught in nets eating by sharks. So stop it. cap

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3535.6s	3535.6	 this is the pile. Now for 24 hour. Yeah, no for 24 hours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3540.0s	3540.0	 He's the incarnation of evil in the eyes of the media and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3542.7s	3542.7	 they're going to move on to a new person in a couple of days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3545.1s	3545.1	 So I mean, look, I think you ever wrote in that. Do we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3550.3s	3550.3	 an email coming out?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3553.1s	3553.1	 Guys, I quit the group chat for a day. I all caps you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3560.5s	3560.5	 rage quit. Can I connect with something to chamath said about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3564.9s	3564.9	 about okay, so that you have this this this larger question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3568.3s	3568.3	 about our did the company grow too fast and our founders asking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3572.1s	3572.1	 the right questions about going too fast. Let me connect that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3574.7s	3574.7	 with the first conversation we had about the macroeconomic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3577.3s	3577.3	 situation. I think you know, every startup board right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3581.8s	3581.8	 probably needs to be having a conversation about the macro
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3584.3s	3584.3	 picture because there's one of two possibilities happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3587.3s	3587.3	 right now we've already seen in the past five weeks, we've seen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3590.8s	3590.8	 30 to 40% correction in the public markets for growth stocks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3596.1s	3596.1	 and SaaS companies that is absolutely going to trickle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3598.4s	3598.4	 down to venture valuations. I think it already has if you look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3602.4s	3602.4	 at the crossover guys like tiger and CO2 and D one, I guarantee
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3606.5s	3606.5	 you, they're all updating their models or valuation models based
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3609.7s	3609.7	 on the public comps. So, you know, we are now in a slightly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3613.3s	3613.3	 different environment. I don't know that 100 times ARR is is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3616.3s	3616.3	 is the metric anymore as it was, you know, say two months ago, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3620.0s	3620.0	 don't know where the new metric is going to land, we're gonna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3622.6s	3622.6	 have to see some deals get done post correction. But, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3627.3s	3627.3	 we could be in a very different environment here. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3629.5s	3629.5	 I think there's two possibilities either the the rate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3632.7s	3632.7	 increases are coming next year are now priced in, and we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3635.3s	3635.3	 going to go back into, you know, a mode of going back up and to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3638.9s	3638.9	 the right. And especially I think if this BBB built gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3642.7s	3642.7	 killed, we'll go back and up to the right. Or this could be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3645.5s	3645.5	 getting be the beginning of a protracted slide. As you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3649.8s	3649.8	 more and more market participants realize that we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3652.5s	3652.5	 in a very different kind of environment. And we may not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3656.0s	3656.0	 have seen the bottom yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3656.9s	3656.9	 We're running a company, Sachs, and you had just raised that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3659.4s	3659.4	 $100 million crazy round at 100 times. What do you do? If you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3665.2s	3665.2	 company, what would you do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3666.4s	3666.4	 I just had this conversation with one of our SaaS founders,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3668.7s	3668.7	 they just closed a monster round at a great valuation. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3671.7s	3671.7	 literally a few weeks ago, and they have some interests for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3675.2s	3675.2	 more people wanting to get into the round. And I just pointed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3677.5s	3677.5	 out, listen, you know, we may be going into a very different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3680.7s	3680.7	 environment. And I think the company is worth the valuation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3684.3s	3684.3	 we got. But you know, the if you just look at the public comps,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3688.5s	3688.5	 valuations are down 3040%. So if we were to take more money into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3692.9s	3692.9	 the round at the same valuation, that's kind of a good deal for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3696.2s	3696.2	 the company. And it gives us more runway gives us more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3698.6s	3698.6	 insurance. So the bag, no doubt, secure. Yeah, so those are the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3701.7s	3701.7	 types of conversations I think it's prudent to be having right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3704.6s	3704.6	 now. And frankly, there's a lot of investors and certainly a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3707.4s	3707.4	 lot of founders who never lived through the dot com crash and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3711.5s	3711.5	 down markets, and they don't know how bad it can get. They've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3714.4s	3714.4	 only seen good times, right? What 18 months of nuclear winter?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3718.2s	3718.2	 No, no checks being written? Yeah, I mean, whatever you have in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3722.9s	3722.9	 the cupboard is what you're eating for the next 2000 to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3725.2s	3725.2	 2003. You had three years of nuclear winter pretty much. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3729.9s	3729.9	 you know, in 2008 2009, it was about 18 months of nuclear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3732.8s	3732.8	 winter. I mean, it's just, it wasn't even it wasn't even that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3736.1s	3736.1	 cold. But you want to hear a great 2008 2009 fundraising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3739.9s	3739.9	 story? Sure. I'm at Facebook, market just implodes. And we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3747.3s	3747.3	 need we decide that we need to raise some insurance just a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3749.9s	3749.9	 little in you know, little insurance policy, little money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3752.1s	3752.1	 little downside protection. And I remember that we were having all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3757.7s	3757.7	 these conversations with TCV. And you know, they're they're a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3762.4s	3762.4	 really good firm, very smart. And basically, you know, we we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3766.8s	3766.8	 told them what the price was, I think it was like $7 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3771.4s	3771.4	 pre right, like $7 billion, we want to raise 500 million, just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3776.1s	3776.1	 please just do it. We just want to get a little margin of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3778.9s	3778.9	 safety. And they came back with their model and they updated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3783.0s	3783.0	 their model, David to your point, and they came back at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3787.7s	3787.7	 like 6.8 or 6.7, something like that 6.5. And we were like, my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3794.7s	3794.7	 god, what the fuck is this? Like, this is not seven, we just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3797.7s	3797.7	 like we just want to raise some money at seven and seven was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3800.2s	3800.2	 down round because we had already taken money from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3802.0s	3802.0	 Microsoft at 10 billion, no, at 15. So we had thought we had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3805.5s	3805.5	 hit the jackpot when a year ago, a year earlier, we raised $249
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3810.8s	3810.8	 million from Microsoft. Now, by the way, why 249 because at 250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3815.2s	3815.2	 million, bomber would have to go to the board. So he goes one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3818.4s	3818.4	 1 million under the number of where bomber can sign the check
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3821.0s	3821.0	 himself. So we get bomber in for 249 at 15 billion. A year later,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3826.5s	3826.5	 the great financial crisis happens, we are raising money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3829.4s	3829.4	 we tell TCB, please just give us 500 million at seven or eight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3832.7s	3832.7	 some number, they come in 700 million under because their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3835.9s	3835.9	 models is whatever. And I will never forget this. It was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3839.3s	3839.3	 Saturday afternoon, I was on the phone. And I think it was with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3841.9s	3841.9	 like Ted Elliott, our general counsel at the time. And we got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3844.8s	3844.8	 an term sheet from a certain person, Yuri Milner at DSP. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3849.7s	3849.7	 you're in he throws the high heater at like eight and a half
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3853.9s	3853.9	 or nine. No board seat all common. I mean, a completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3858.6s	3858.6	 disruptive mood, move and move. And all I just remember asking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3864.5s	3864.5	 Ted Elliott was does he vet? Meaning like, will the wire clear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3868.9s	3868.9	 will justice let the money come into the United States? Not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3872.3s	3872.3	 knowing right, because we had heard, you know, anyways, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3875.0s	3875.0	 money cleared, we took the check and the rest is history. I have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3878.3s	3878.3	 a good story about when you are when you are facing an enormous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3884.3s	3884.3	 downturn, you have a fiduciary responsibility, David, to your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3888.6s	3888.6	 point to make sure you're well capitalized. But then on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3893.1s	3893.1	 other side, you have a really important fiduciary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3895.5s	3895.5	 responsibility to you and all the employees and everybody else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3898.5s	3898.5	 to run this thing properly. And you cannot get confused that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3905.0s	3905.0	 value and valuation are not the same thing. Absolutely not. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3910.4s	3910.4	 so the minute you conflate the two, and you're like, I'm an X
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3913.6s	3913.6	 billion dollar company and start behaving that way, you're dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3916.6s	3916.6	 By the way, there's a big difference. I think it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3918.1s	3918.1	 important to note, I know it's been said many times before, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3920.4s	3920.4	 I'll, I'll say it again. There's a difference between what your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3925.5s	3925.5	 responsibility is as a board and as a fiduciary to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3928.3s	3928.3	 shareholders of that individual company. And what the incentives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3931.8s	3931.8	 and motivations are for the big investor that just put all this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3935.7s	3935.7	 money into your company for their portfolio as a whole. For
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3939.4s	3939.4	 their portfolio as a whole, they would rather tell everyone, go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3943.3s	3943.3	 hard, go fast, spend as much money as you can. And they hope
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3947.0s	3947.0	 that one out of 10 companies becomes 100x from there. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3950.4s	3950.4	 it's okay if nine out of 10 die. So they don't care if you die.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3955.2s	3955.2	 They care if one out of 10 companies goes 100x. Yep, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3959.4s	3959.4	 have a different incentive and a different motivation. Because if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3962.2s	3962.2	 the company dies, your shareholders, you as an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3965.2s	3965.2	 entrepreneur, your team lose out. And that tension needs to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3969.5s	3969.5	 understood really clearly by entrepreneurs and executives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3972.5s	3972.5	 that are taking money under these conditions. Tiger Global,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3978.9s	3978.9	 investing there. But the incentive for them is quite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3981.4s	3981.4	 different than it is for you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3992.0s	3992.0	 indifferent. As long as they have one go 100x. It's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=3994.8s	3994.8	 No matter what happens to you. When I met Uri Milner, he came

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4006.7s	4006.7	 you take a board seat? That's never happened. And he looked at

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4280.9s	4280.9	 I mean, it's just very weird. I mean, I think on a race issue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4283.6s	4283.6	 this is like the worst possible thing to happen. Because we do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4287.2s	4287.2	 have instances of Asian hate of you know, people being beaten up

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4294.0s	4294.0	 whatever it is. And then this person is so mentally deranged
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4298.5s	4298.5	 that they set up a bias race attack. Apparently, am I correct
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4303.4s	4303.4	 that he did this in order to get sympathy so that his acting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4306.7s	4306.7	 career would do better? Or do we not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4309.3s	4309.3	 Negotiating his contract and he's worried about getting cut
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4312.0s	4312.0	 from the show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4313.6s	4313.6	 What he was on the show Empire and he was worried about getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4315.9s	4315.9	 cut from cut from the show. But look, I to me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4318.7s	4318.7	 hold on, explain that to me. He's worried about getting cut
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4320.6s	4320.6	 from the show. So the logic jump is if I had a race attack, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4323.4s	4323.4	 can't fire me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4324.5s	4324.5	 No, I play the sympathy card.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4325.7s	4325.7	 Sympathy card. I got it. Yeah, I'm just want to make sure I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4327.8s	4327.8	 understanding it. I'm not crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4329.4s	4329.4	 He made himself into a cause celeb of the woke left. This is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4332.7s	4332.7	 an early 2019 when everyone was worried about, you know, Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4337.7s	4337.7	 So he claimed that he was beaten by two MAGA, you know, haters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4343.3s	4343.3	 who tied a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him. I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4346.4s	4346.4	 not sure what the bleach was about. I think maybe that was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4349.5s	4349.5	 even wider something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4350.6s	4350.6	 He said to white dudes. Okay. And then and then at one point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4356.8s	4356.8	 he in the in the interview when they the interrogators or the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4360.8s	4360.8	 investigators were pressing, are you sure they were white? He
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4363.1s	4363.1	 said, Well, you know, I don't want to be racist. Like, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4368.7s	4368.7	 then it turned out the two dudes were black. Like, I mean, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4372.6s	4372.6	 from the I heard them. He hired them. He hired them and he paid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4376.1s	4376.1	 them by check. So this is not like a master criminal. There's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4379.7s	4379.7	 no Lex Luthor. No, no. But look, I think this story what it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4384.6s	4384.6	 really about is not just a story about one sociopath doing this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4387.6s	4387.6	 crazy thing. It's really more a media story. This is about how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4391.2s	4391.2	 the media covered it. They loved it. And I think this wall to wall
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4395.5s	4395.5	 coverage. And I think this reflects all the worst qualities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4398.0s	4398.0	 of the media. Number one, rush to judgment. They immediately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4401.7s	4401.7	 bought into the story and they were attacking the Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4405.0s	4405.0	 administration for creating the hate and the maga people. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4408.3s	4408.3	 there was a feeding frenzy. Number two, there was no and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4411.0s	4411.0	 this goes with the rush to judgment. They didn't do any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4413.6s	4413.6	 fact checking whatsoever, right? Because the story was too good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4416.9s	4416.9	 It fit all their priors, just like the Rolling Stone, Iver
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4419.7s	4419.7	 Macdon hoax about, you know, the maga people, you know, in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4422.9s	4422.9	 Oklahoma hospitals, whatever that story was too good. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4425.9s	4425.9	 Rolling Stone and Rachel Maddow bought no fact check on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4428.7s	4428.7	 hoax hook line sinker because they didn't do the fact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4430.9s	4430.9	 checking. And then number three, no corrections. None of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4434.4s	4434.4	 these sources ever apologize did the maya culpa issued a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4437.5s	4437.5	 correction. There's just an eerie silence coming out of all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4441.1s	4441.1	 the sources who pumped the story like crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4443.4s	4443.4	 You have to, Nick, please put it in the show notes. The there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4448.0s	4448.0	 got to be a YouTube clip of the Chappelle joke around juicy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4450.9s	4450.9	 Smollett. And the basic joke is like every colored person stayed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4455.2s	4455.2	 silent, all the blacks, all the browns. And the joke, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4458.7s	4458.7	 punchline of the joke is because we were all like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4464.2s	4464.2	 you know, like, why aren't you defending juicy Spolay? And the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4467.2s	4467.2	 whole point is, he looks kind of guilty does. Well, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4470.7s	4470.7	 hold on a second. If you let's just play 15 seconds of this, a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4475.3s	4475.3	 deep link to his first interview. I think this is his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4478.3s	4478.3	 first full interview. Just play 10 seconds of that because this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4481.0s	4481.0	 is of juicy Smollett. Yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4483.7s	4483.7	 I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4487.1s	4487.1	 And I said, there's a rope around my neck. Did you get any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4490.1s	4490.1	 kind of description of the attack? I gave a body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4493.5s	4493.5	 description and I you know, because I saw this, but and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4497.3s	4497.3	 know, right here or whatever, but I didn't see I can't tell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4499.8s	4499.8	 you what color their eyes were. And I did not see anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4504.3s	4504.3	 except the second person I saw running away. And the first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4508.1s	4508.1	 person Yeah, I saw saw his stature. I gave the description
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4513.7s	4513.7	 as best as I could. You have to understand also that it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4516.7s	4516.7	 Chicago in winter. People can wear ski masks and nobody's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4523.5s	4523.5	 going to question that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4524.2s	4524.2	 It's just so deranged. I mean, the poker towels are flying off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4527.3s	4527.3	 of him. He's like thinking, does this make him a bad actor? I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4531.5s	4531.5	 just want to know David as a producer. Are you hiring him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4534.9s	4534.9	 now or not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4536.4s	4536.4	 Maybe maybe I will hire him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4539.5s	4539.5	 Finally got his Emmy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4542.0s	4542.0	 Oh my god, sorry, too soon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4543.3s	4543.3	 But the crazy thing here is that a lot of people all the liberal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4546.6s	4546.6	 elites basically fell for this hook line and sinker President
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4549.0s	4549.0	 Biden, Vice President Harris Pelosi is they all jumped the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4554.0s	4554.0	 gun on this and were basically denouncing what they bought into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4557.2s	4557.2	 the story. They were denouncing this racist attack and blaming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4560.9s	4560.9	 Trump and the administration for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4563.1s	4563.1	 the new policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4564.7s	4564.7	 I wait until the court case is over to comment on these crazy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4569.7s	4569.7	 things. I don't want to comment on a Twitter. I don't like it or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4572.7s	4572.7	 retweet it. We have a justice system. If this stuff is hitting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4575.8s	4575.8	 the justice system, just let the process happen because right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4579.9s	4579.9	 The velocity of social media is such that we talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4583.5s	4583.5	 algorithms all the time. That if something like this happens,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4586.3s	4586.3	 it's going to become the number one. So we're in a billion people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4588.8s	4588.8	 are going to see it. And then there's fallout. And the fallout
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4591.5s	4591.5	 here is it just divides the guy. Everybody shut up and wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4594.8s	4594.8	 The same thing happened on the written house case, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4596.7s	4596.7	 Absolutely. Just wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4597.5s	4597.5	 Rushed to judgment. They use this kid to being a white
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4601.1s	4601.1	 supremacist attacker who basically like a school shooter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4603.9s	4603.9	 It turned out to be totally false. But you know, the court
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4606.6s	4606.6	 systems have been doing an amazing job. When you think about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4608.6s	4608.6	 the cases, I think the courts have been on quite a run in, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4611.9s	4611.9	 think, contra distinction to the media keeps getting it wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4614.4s	4614.4	 Right? So you think about it. So Derek Chauvin convicted,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4617.6s	4617.6	 Jussie Smollett convicted, the the three killers of a mod
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4621.7s	4621.7	 Arbery convicted. Okay, but Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4626.7s	4626.7	 Kenneth Walker, not guilty. This was Breonna Taylor's boyfriend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4631.1s	4631.1	 who killed a cop when they killed her. Remember, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4635.1s	4635.1	 bust into the apartment. He basically pledged his case, he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4640.5s	4640.5	 pled self defense, because he didn't know who was shooting at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4643.2s	4643.2	 them. And he got no nock warrant. Yeah, he got off just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4647.1s	4647.1	 like how written house did. So, you know, people I think are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4650.2s	4650.2	 jumping the gun on a lot of these cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4651.7s	4651.7	 There's actually an enormous amount of justice. America is an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4655.3s	4655.3	 incredible country. We don't get enough credit for that. Mostly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4658.4s	4658.4	 finds a way to get to the right place. Obviously, there are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4661.4s	4661.4	 moments where we completely get it wrong. But David, to your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4665.9s	4665.9	 point, those are some really powerful examples in modern
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4668.6s	4668.6	 history, with a lot of scrutiny, where our peers, American jurors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4674.7s	4674.7	 found the way to get to the right answer. Yeah. Feels great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4678.1s	4678.1	 Yeah, bravo to America. Bravo to those folks. Good job. Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4681.8s	4681.8	 job. By the way, the Breonna Taylor example is a really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4684.3s	4684.3	 wonderful example. And the mod Arbery thing was really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4686.4s	4686.4	 important to me as well. Thank you for bringing it up. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4688.3s	4688.3	 appreciate it. Yeah. Well, you know, because because I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4690.9s	4690.9	 you know, when the written house verdict came down, a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4693.3s	4693.3	 people were saying, well, look, if Kyle Rittenhouse had been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4696.1s	4696.1	 black, he wouldn't have gotten the self defense is just as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4698.9s	4698.9	 well. Kenneth Walker, actually, that case was a self defense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4702.3s	4702.3	 case. And he killed a single article in the mainstream media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4705.6s	4705.6	 to basically actually defend Kenneth Walker. Yeah. And he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4709.2s	4709.2	 actually shot a cop, right? And but and he still got off because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4713.9s	4713.9	 when they bust into that apartment, the jury thought it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4716.1s	4716.1	 was reasonable, very, very self defense, very tragic that that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4719.9s	4719.9	 that the officer died, and I'm sorry, but I really hope that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJsxamu8f4&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=77&t=4722.9s	4722.9	 Kenneth Walker has a really amazing productive life from
