https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=269.4s	269.4	 So I was exposed. Yes, you're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=270.6s	270.6	 It's about 10 days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=271.8s	271.8	 But you're you're convinced that was the only way you could have gotten it. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=275.6s	275.6	 Yeah, because somebody else at the dinner got has symptoms now, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=279.4s	279.4	 Ah, so it was a super spreader at Matsuhisa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=282.2s	282.2	 Yeah. Yeah, basically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=283.9s	283.9	 But it shows you how virulent this new Delta variant is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=288.6s	288.6	 I mean, you've got there are four people out that night,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=293.0s	293.0	 plus the person who who had it and two out of the four basically got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=299.1s	299.1	 And we were all vaccinated, including the person who had it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=303.2s	303.2	 And of course, he didn't know he had it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=304.8s	304.8	 He didn't have any symptoms till the next day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=307.3s	307.3	 So and, you know, I got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=309.6s	309.6	 I got it five days after exposure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=312.1s	312.1	 It's that five days is like clockwork.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=314.1s	314.1	 You know, did you did you have like a pulse box?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=316.6s	316.6	 Did you measure any of these other things?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=318.0s	318.0	 Did any of that stuff change at all?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=319.9s	319.9	 Yeah. I mean, I have the pulse ox meter and it's been around 95 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=324.4s	324.4	 So it is down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=325.4s	325.4	 You should be like 98, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=326.9s	326.9	 Yeah, it is down slightly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=328.6s	328.6	 It is down slightly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=329.7s	329.7	 And if you go to 92 or 93, they say go to the emergency room, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=333.6s	333.6	 And and did you self isolate from your family?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=337.4s	337.4	 Yeah, I did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=338.2s	338.2	 But we were lulled a little bit into a place of overconfidence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=343.0s	343.0	 Yeah. Well, I remember I got I got covid test on Wednesday and then Friday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=346.0s	346.0	 And they're both negative. I thought we're through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=347.7s	347.7	 So I was at home and and then and then so my 11 year old got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=355.0s	355.0	 Even though I was isolating, this thing is I mean, this thing is so contagious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=358.7s	358.7	 So, you know, what I've read is that Delta variant is 60 percent more transmissible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=363.1s	363.1	 than the UK variant, which was the alpha variant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=365.6s	365.6	 The alpha variant was 60 percent more transmissible than original covid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=369.0s	369.0	 So you're looking at the transmissibility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=371.2s	371.2	 You multiply those together of two and a half times the original.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=374.0s	374.0	 And the original covid had an R naught of two to three.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=377.8s	377.8	 So you multiply two to three by two and a half times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=380.3s	380.3	 And you're looking at five to eight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=382.8s	382.8	 And, you know, at the end to the audience, what that means in terms of reality,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=386.3s	386.3	 it means the R naught is how many people does the average infected person transmit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=392.8s	392.8	 before they know they have it and can fully self isolate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=396.4s	396.4	 And so you're going from the original covid was two to three.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=400.4s	400.4	 Delta variant might be like eight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=402.5s	402.5	 We're getting up into like smallpox territory with this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=405.8s	405.8	 And it's all the more transmissible because, you know, vaccinated people can get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=411.2s	411.2	 You know, the the Israel data that we talked about on the show last week was 64
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=416.0s	416.0	 percent effectiveness that Israel reported that the effectiveness of Pfizer had gone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=420.8s	420.8	 from like 95 percent to 64 percent in terms of preventing infection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=425.6s	425.6	 So you have maybe a third of vaccinated people can get it and then they can spread it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=430.8s	430.8	 without even knowing they have it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=433.1s	433.1	 So I think we're at the point now where if you're not vaccinated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=437.1s	437.1	 you're going to get you're going to get the Delta variant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=439.1s	439.1	 We're seeing now cases explode, you know, all over the country, even in L.A.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=444.4s	444.4	 County. They've now had a the five day average of cases has jumped five
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=449.2s	449.2	 hundred percent in one month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=450.8s	450.8	 So pretty much. And Jason, you've tweeted this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=453.3s	453.3	 If you are not vaccinated, you are choosing to get the Delta variant at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=456.9s	456.9	 I mean, this thing is extremely transmissible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=459.3s	459.3	 That's what there was a great tweet by Scott Adams,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=462.2s	462.2	 the guy who the cartoonist who I wouldn't who listens to the pod, by the way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=466.4s	466.4	 who does listen to the pod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=467.9s	467.9	 He had a he had a really great quote.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=469.7s	469.7	 He's like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=472.4s	472.4	 Today is either Wednesday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=475.4s	475.4	 Yeah. For those that are vaccinated or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=480.5s	480.5	 yet another day where the unvaccinated amongst you are likely to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=484.8s	484.8	 COVID, something like that, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=486.0s	486.0	 Was that the tweet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=486.5s	486.5	 Yeah, it was basically today's Wednesday for people who are vaccinated, or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=490.6s	490.6	 it is the day you're going to get, you know, the the virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=494.0s	494.0	 Yeah, we got to stop stop messing around with this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=496.2s	496.2	 Now, here's some here's some good news, actually, is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=500.1s	500.1	 so on the the Wednesday when we found out that my friend had tested positive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=504.4s	504.4	 But again, I was still negative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=505.8s	505.8	 I had no symptoms. I had nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=508.2s	508.2	 I told my wife she had gotten one shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=510.4s	510.4	 She hadn't gotten the second shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=511.6s	511.6	 And we were on the fence about whether my 13 year old should get the vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=514.4s	514.4	 They both raced out that day, got vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=517.6s	517.6	 Of course, we did not get the virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=519.4s	519.4	 So they had basically call it three or four days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=522.9s	522.9	 of the of the vaccine to trigger an immune response in their system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=526.2s	526.2	 And that protected them. They did not get sick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=528.6s	528.6	 And David, did you take anything else like prednisone?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=531.3s	531.3	 You took nothing, no steroid, nothing, nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=533.8s	533.8	 The only stuff I did. So my friend did take he did get prescribed prednisone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=538.0s	538.0	 My doctor thought that was unnecessary or a bad idea for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=541.0s	541.0	 All I took, OK, was Tylenol to control the fever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=544.5s	544.5	 And I took Flonase to reduce the sinus congestion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=547.8s	547.8	 Look, I mean, I don't want to overstate this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=549.5s	549.5	 It was a very mild cold for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=552.2s	552.2	 And that is why I think everybody should run out and get vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=555.6s	555.6	 What did you pair it with?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=556.4s	556.4	 Like a Pappy Van Winkle or did you go with a screaming eagle?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=559.9s	559.9	 What did you pair your girlfriend?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=561.5s	561.5	 Freeburg also the worst part is Matsuhisa has such a shit wine list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=565.2s	565.2	 You probably drank this like random swill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=567.2s	567.2	 That's what you were drinking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=568.2s	568.2	 Some like Nagiri Saki in all likelihood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=571.1s	571.1	 Freeburg, last week, I was asking you or maybe it was two weeks ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=575.7s	575.7	 I was considering getting the Moderna because I was like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=578.0s	578.0	 I think getting two of these things will boost you into the high 90s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=581.9s	581.9	 You said I was crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=583.9s	583.9	 Has your position changed on that? Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=586.4s	586.4	 OK, explain, because this is the one time I'm ever going to be right about science.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=591.4s	591.4	 A week before you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=592.8s	592.8	 So I think I think the data up to that point didn't necessarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=596.7s	596.7	 kind of validate that additional level of action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=599.9s	599.9	 But now it does. And I think new data is coming out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=602.8s	602.8	 So I saw an executive from a pharmaceutical company a few days ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=608.3s	608.3	 OK, who broke down some statistics that they looked at in Israel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=614.9s	614.9	 And what they were identifying was that of the newly infected cases in Israel,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=621.2s	621.2	 of people that are vaccinated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=624.4s	624.4	 nearly two thirds of those people were vaccinated in January.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=628.4s	628.4	 About 30 percent were vaccinated in February
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=630.8s	630.8	 and less than 10 percent were vaccinated in March.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=632.8s	632.8	 And I'm just approximating and I'm just kind of transcribing, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=638.4s	638.4	 from kind of what I remember him saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=640.5s	640.5	 And so he said, you know, the more recent vaccinations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=643.6s	643.6	 we're not seeing breakthrough cases, breakthrough infections.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=646.5s	646.5	 So the more recently you're vaccinated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=649.7s	649.7	 the less likely you are to have this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=651.8s	651.8	 And then I met with a pretty well-known virologist a few days ago as well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=658.8s	658.8	 who highlighted for me that we are seeing antibody titers decline over time in people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=664.6s	664.6	 But there's other studies that are showing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=666.9s	666.9	 which means that the antibodies against covid in your blood after you get the vaccine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=670.2s	670.2	 slowly go down over time. So we're seeing that. We knew that, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=673.2s	673.2	 We knew that to some extent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=674.8s	674.8	 But there was another study that showed that memory B cells,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=678.2s	678.2	 B cells are the immune cells that make antibodies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=681.2s	681.2	 and they remember the antibodies to make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=683.3s	683.3	 And they were worried, are we losing those B cells in the human body?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=686.6s	686.6	 And another study found actually they're in your lymph nodes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=688.7s	688.7	 So they went in, they pulled them out and they identified, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=691.2s	691.2	 these B cells are persistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=693.2s	693.2	 We are having a persistent immune memory to covid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=696.0s	696.0	 when we get exposed to the vaccine or the virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=698.8s	698.8	 And and so, you know, those two data points,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=703.2s	703.2	 both of them kind of said, I think we're going to need to do a booster very soon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=706.7s	706.7	 for everyone and we're going to need to get a third shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=709.4s	709.4	 The tail free bird seems like it's like six months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=712.7s	712.7	 Yeah, it sounds like he was saying that you're going to see an efficacy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=715.3s	715.3	 drop to that kind of two thirds level after about six months of your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=718.5s	718.5	 after getting your vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=720.6s	720.6	 And, you know, he said, look, this Delta variant is virulent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=724.1s	724.1	 but, you know, the more pressing kind of point isn't that it's this variant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=728.8s	728.8	 that's breaking through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=730.3s	730.3	 It's that the efficiency of these vaccines at this point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=733.9s	733.9	 looks like it's such that we're going to need to do boosters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=736.3s	736.3	 Now, Pfizer went to the White House this week with some of this data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=740.4s	740.4	 and they presented it to the White House and the White House said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=743.7s	743.7	 if you guys follow the news, I'm hearing this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=746.2s	746.2	 I'm repeating what I read in news reports at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=750.3s	750.3	 But what they said was, you know, we're not ready to kind of commit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=754.4s	754.4	 to doing booster shots for a couple of reasons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=757.4s	757.4	 One is there are a lot of people out there that haven't had their first shots
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=761.4s	761.4	 and we're seeing the people that are having these breakthrough infections
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=766.5s	766.5	 almost universally, not always, but very, very large majority
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=770.7s	770.7	 having very mild symptoms and not getting hospitalized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=774.1s	774.1	 And the death rate is still very, very low.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=776.3s	776.3	 In other words, the vaccine did its job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=778.7s	778.7	 The vaccine didn't didn't prevent, you know, an infection,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=781.9s	781.9	 meaning that the virus starts replicating in a way that's uncontrolled in your body,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=786.2s	786.2	 but that your immune system had enough of a defense to keep it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=788.9s	788.9	 from causing severe disease in your body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=790.8s	790.8	 Ninety nine percent of the people going to the hospital are unvaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=795.6s	795.6	 Right. Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=796.6s	796.6	 And so we're seeing that great success still with the vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=800.7s	800.7	 But they are seeing and there are now studies that, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=803.6s	803.6	 I think reference to your earlier point that, you know, if you put a different RNA strain,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=809.2s	809.2	 RNA sequence into your body, which Moderna and Pfizer have slightly different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=812.7s	812.7	 sequences, you end up creating different antibodies and having more diversity of antibodies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=818.2s	818.2	 can kind of provide greater immunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=820.3s	820.3	 So it's almost certain we're going to get boosters and that we're going to end up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=824.0s	824.0	 seeing them hit the market next month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=825.8s	825.8	 But is the is the booster different than the original?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=830.3s	830.3	 So, for example, if I get a Pfizer booster,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=833.0s	833.0	 am I only basically getting still an expression of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=836.8s	836.8	 RNA strand that I'm supposed to basically like, is it the same formulation, the same dosage?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=842.4s	842.4	 So both of those options are still up in the air.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=845.8s	845.8	 And so we may still get the same vaccines that we were getting before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=849.3s	849.3	 You could go get a Moderna shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=850.5s	850.5	 You could go get another Pfizer shot of the exact same RNA sequence that you got before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=855.6s	855.6	 Or they may introduce some new ones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=857.4s	857.4	 And so all the pharma companies are proposing both.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=860.7s	860.7	 Approaches and they're pursuing both paths right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=863.5s	863.5	 And we'll see where we end up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=864.7s	864.7	 And what about swapping between an RNA approach and a traditional vaccine approach?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=868.8s	868.8	 So getting J&J plus Moderna or Pfizer versus like there's a lot of A B testing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=873.7s	873.7	 we need to do to figure out what is the most efficacious and useful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=876.9s	876.9	 This is exactly like this is reminds me exactly of HIV, where it took 10 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=881.6s	881.6	 for them to figure out what cocktail actually worked the best.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=884.3s	884.3	 And now look, HIV is I mean, it's it's it's survival.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=887.8s	887.8	 Nothing. It's really not that not that bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=890.1s	890.1	 The way that we probably for those of us in our 40s have it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=893.2s	893.2	 emblazoned in our mind is how bad it is versus how bad it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=896.0s	896.0	 It was a death sentence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=897.5s	897.5	 It seemed like a death sentence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=898.8s	898.8	 And today it's kind of more it's more manageable than frankly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=901.6s	901.6	 It's a chronic disease now that's at best.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=903.4s	903.4	 Yeah, it's like having diabetes or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=905.6s	905.6	 I have another crazy statement here, which is that if you take the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=909.6s	909.6	 the case fatality rate of Covid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=912.9s	912.9	 and now you think about the fact that there's going to be call it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=916.9s	916.9	 60 percent of America that's vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=919.8s	919.8	 And then every six months will be getting boosters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=922.4s	922.4	 And then you have the Petri dish on the other side of the 40 percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=926.7s	926.7	 where you'll just be ripping through variant after variant after variant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=930.7s	930.7	 Eventually, it stands to reason that if 40 percent of Americans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=934.8s	934.8	 remain unvaccinated two or three years from now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=938.4s	938.4	 the odds that there will be a strain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=941.8s	941.8	 that is the killer strain that does meaningful damage to those people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=947.1s	947.1	 I think is basically 100 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=949.9s	949.9	 And if you think about a case fatality rate that's meaningfully high,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=953.3s	953.3	 what you're effectively going to do is start to call these people from the earth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=957.2s	957.2	 And that is a crazy idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=959.5s	959.5	 But that's what folks who choose to not get vaccinated are setting themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=962.8s	962.8	 I mean, it's the quintessential, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=966.3s	966.3	 is that just not probabilities?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=967.6s	967.6	 Like, am I getting something wrong here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=968.8s	968.8	 Probabilistically, isn't that this what I'm concerned about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=971.5s	971.5	 And it's not just Americans not getting vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=974.3s	974.3	 It's the rest of the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=975.3s	975.3	 I mean, even if we got to extraordinarily, extraordinarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=978.2s	978.2	 high vaccination rates in the US, there's going to be large,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=981.2s	981.2	 you know, numbers of people outside the US who never get vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=984.2s	984.2	 It will continue to be a petri dish to give you to, you know, comparison.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=989.1s	989.1	 The common cold has 1800 variants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=991.6s	991.6	 That's why we can't get vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=993.2s	993.2	 So, you know, we're on the Delta variant right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=996.0s	996.0	 I think they actually have numbered variants up to lambda.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=998.8s	998.8	 We're going to run out of the letters of the alphabet really soon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1001.6s	1001.6	 You know, how long will it be until there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1003.9s	1003.9	 There are these killer variants that that act.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1005.8s	1005.8	 I mean, look, I mean, that could punch through that can punch through the vaccines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1010.5s	1010.5	 It's pretty scary, actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1011.8s	1011.8	 And I would say that this is like quite a come down off where we were just two weeks ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1017.8s	1017.8	 you know, where we thought the Pfizer vaccine was still 95 percent effective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1022.0s	1022.0	 Now it's 64 percent effective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1023.8s	1023.8	 I mean, look, I do want to like underscore that the vaccine worked in the sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1028.2s	1028.2	 that what I got was super mild.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1030.0s	1030.0	 I mean, it was really just like getting a cold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1032.5s	1032.5	 I mean, I didn't need to take anything more serious than Tylenol.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1035.8s	1035.8	 But but it does show that the virus is mutating really fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1040.2s	1040.2	 It's highly transmissible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1042.0s	1042.0	 And I'm not sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1044.0s	1044.0	 So you still have it. You still have it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1046.4s	1046.4	 I still have it. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1047.8s	1047.8	 Yeah. So when will you get tested to figure out when you don't have it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1050.8s	1050.8	 And I'll probably go in tomorrow because it feels it feels to me like I'm about 98 percent better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1056.4s	1056.4	 Freeburg, is there is there any data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1059.4s	1059.4	 about the pattern of people who are vaccinated getting this thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1063.0s	1063.0	 Like, is there remember how like, you know, there was early data that showed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1067.0s	1067.0	 you know, women had a different immune response than men and like people who were.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1071.2s	1071.2	 What was it? Oh, positive or, you know, a certain blood type effectively had inborn immunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1076.7s	1076.7	 I haven't heard or read anything like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1079.4s	1079.4	 And so this is still an emerging issue, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1083.0s	1083.0	 You know, by the way, I was vaccinated a few months ago, guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1086.4s	1086.4	 Like, I mean, I'm like, you're three of us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1089.8s	1089.8	 When was your second shot?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1092.1s	1092.1	 Basically, like a few months ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1094.1s	1094.1	 Yeah, it's minus in March.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1096.2s	1096.2	 Yeah. One thing I think it's worth highlighting just to reinforce the vaccine importance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1101.4s	1101.4	 You know, the virologist, the infectious disease guy I met with was telling me that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1105.8s	1105.8	 you know, one way to think about this is the more opportunity the virus has to replicate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1111.8s	1111.8	 the more opportunity it has to evolve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1114.4s	1114.4	 And so when you're vaccinated and you have a mild case
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1118.2s	1118.2	 and your body recovers in a few days, just to give you guys a sense, the difference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1123.4s	1123.4	 when someone that's not vaccinated has COVID and they've measured the viral load in the nose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1127.9s	1127.9	 from day one when they start having their infectious kind of presentation to day four,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1132.3s	1132.3	 which is when they peak, the viral load is 10 to the eight higher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1136.6s	1136.6	 OK, that's like 100 million times higher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1139.8s	1139.8	 And so that's 100 million times more viruses that are being produced on day four than were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1143.9s	1143.9	 being produced on day one when you were already showing symptoms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1147.0s	1147.0	 So every time a virus is being produced and is replicating within your body,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1151.3s	1151.3	 it's getting a chance to mutate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1153.0s	1153.0	 The important point he emphasized was what matters most is we get the most number of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1157.0s	1157.0	 people on planet Earth vaccinated as fast as possible, because the faster you can get more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1161.7s	1161.7	 people vaccinated, the fewer opportunities you give the virus to replicate and find itself a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1166.2s	1166.2	 mutational path that can ultimately break through all these vaccines and cause real severe loss of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1171.9s	1171.9	 life. And so the presentation that Sachs described is encouraging in the sense that it likely means
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1179.5s	1179.5	 that the virus did not create that. There wasn't that much of a viral load or a huge viral load
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1183.8s	1183.8	 relative to what there would have been if he wasn't vaccinated. And so even though he did have an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1188.7s	1188.7	 infection, the virus didn't get as much of a chance to spread to other people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1193.4s	1193.4	 It didn't get as much of a chance to mutate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1194.7s	1194.7	 But it did because my friend, who I got it from after having dinner one night,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1199.4s	1199.4	 he was double vaxxed with Pfizer. And it might, you know, my 11 year old daughter got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1205.4s	1205.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1206.2s	1206.2	 It's for her. Again, it's just like a cold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1208.4s	1208.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1209.1s	1209.1	 But so this thing is highly transmissible. And what does it change? It changes the equation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1215.0s	1215.0	 I think, on some policy questions. So yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1217.8s	1217.8	 that's what I was going to ask you. What does it mean for the fall? What now? What?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1221.8s	1221.8	 So two weeks ago, I thought that because I was vaccinated, I didn't need to care whether other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1227.8s	1227.8	 people were vaccinated because the, you know, up until that point, the data was you were 95% plus,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1233.7s	1233.7	 you know, effectiveness. So why care if other people get vaccinated?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1237.3s	1237.3	 Now we can say for sure that, that unvaccinated people can, or vaccinated people even can get,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1243.8s	1243.8	 other people can get you sick, even if you are vaccinated. So I think it absolutely changes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1249.1s	1249.1	 the equation on, so for example, colleges were requiring students to get vaccinated to return
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1255.3s	1255.3	 in the fall. Like before, I didn't think that necessarily made a lot of sense because if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1259.5s	1259.5	 wanted to protect yourself, you just get vaccinated. But now it makes sense, right? Because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1263.9s	1263.9	 the college needs to get to herd immunity to protect everybody against, you know, potentially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1270.0s	1270.0	 Delta variant, right? So I do think it changes the equation quite a bit. And I think we need to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1275.5s	1275.5	 a big push here to get everyone vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1277.1s	1277.1	 Are you then in fact, Saks for vax passports, which as you know, libertarian, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1286.5s	1286.5	 is I think part of your political, I think everybody on this call has kind of got a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1290.3s	1290.3	 libertarian, like you got to make your own choices here. But does it change your thinking about that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1294.7s	1294.7	 i.e. employers, colleges, city, state workers, teachers are either get vaxed or don't come back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1303.3s	1303.3	 to the office and you're fired?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1305.4s	1305.4	 Well, I'll tell you, I don't like the idea of government having the power to stick a needle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1312.5s	1312.5	 in your arm. But I do think that employers, workplaces, schools, I think it's very reasonable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1318.2s	1318.2	 for them to say, if you want to come back to the workplace, you have to get vaccinated because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1323.3s	1323.3	 your unvaccinated status creates a risk. It creates an externality for everybody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1327.4s	1327.4	 Should they be able to fire you if you're a teacher? Should they be able to fire you if you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1330.9s	1330.9	 a bus driver, if you're a pilot?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1332.9s	1332.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1333.2s	1333.2	 Okay, so here's the craziness. This is a self inflicted wound, we are down to only 700,000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1340.8s	1340.8	 vaccines being given a day we peaked, we had the ability to do 5 million shots a day at the peak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1347.4s	1347.4	 Back in April, we hit over 5 million shots in one day in the United States. And that's a country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1352.5s	1352.5	 where you know, whatever 270 million adults, you know, were able to get it. In other words,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1357.3s	1357.3	 2% of the adult population in a single day could have gotten it now we're down to 700, we have over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1362.5s	1362.5	 a billion vaccines sitting on shelves 80% of Democrats have received one shot compared to 49%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1368.2s	1368.2	 of Republicans. 27% of Republicans say that they won't get vaccinated under any circumstances
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1375.0s	1375.0	 compared to 3% of Democrats answering that question the same way and an additional 9%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1379.7s	1379.7	 will only do so if required. Again, 3% of Democrats said they would only do so required.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1383.7s	1383.7	 So that's 36% are opting out for I get it. But this because we allowed it to become a position,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1391.1s	1391.1	 meaning it's not it's not like in anybody has a position on breathing. Breathing is not a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1395.8s	1395.8	 political position. Right? It's not like I choose to not breathe or drinking water, or trying to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1401.4s	1401.4	 you know, like these like eating three meals a day, if you can. We have allowed the most basic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1407.8s	1407.8	 of issues in this case, you know, collective public health to be politicized in a way and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1412.7s	1412.7	 that is entirely the government's fault. It's the government's fault and it's the media's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1417.3s	1417.3	 fault. And the media because the media has exacerbated it so that they can have power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1422.2s	1422.2	 People on the conservative side of the spectrum have learned to distrust the media and big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1426.5s	1426.5	 corporations because and government because they've been lied to so often most recently with the whole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1431.4s	1431.4	 Yeah, right. Most recently with like the lab leak theory. And so you know, there's this suspicion on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1436.8s	1436.8	 the right, like what aren't they telling us? You know? Now look, I think we got to get over this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1441.4s	1441.4	 I think, you know, we need to get everyone vaccinated for all the reasons that Freebrook said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1446.3s	1446.3	 or look, everyone's going to get Delta variant. I mean, maybe this is a good news is that we can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1450.6s	1450.6	 rapidly get to herd immunity by everyone getting Delta variant. Well, that's the inevitable outcome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1454.3s	1454.3	 for any infectious disease, right? Highly infectious disease is either you can vaccinate or everyone's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1459.3s	1459.3	 going to get it. And it's gonna, you know, I mean, kind of Delta variant maybe than whatever the,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1464.5s	1464.5	 you know, more dangerous deadly one is. Yeah, let me just highlight what I'm most concerned about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1468.8s	1468.8	 I am most concerned about what's what's happening with sacks. It's just anecdotally speaking, I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1472.9s	1472.9	 not going to speak to the, I'll speak to one statistic, but like anecdotally speaking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1476.5s	1476.5	 I'm hearing this happening more frequently. I don't know about you guys, other friends,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1481.0s	1481.0	 other people, you know, but a lot of other people I'm hearing about their double backs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1484.5s	1484.5	 that are now getting COVID. So as that starts to happen, the implications for the economy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1492.0s	1492.0	 I think are pretty significant. Because I think people, whether there's a policy change or not,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1497.8s	1497.8	 people are going to get scared again. And people, if we're not kind of enforcing economic lockdown,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1502.9s	1502.9	 people will go into social lockdown. And we're going to revisit, you know, more of the behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1508.1s	1508.1	 we saw over the past year, where people are going to be nervous to travel, people are going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1512.7s	1512.7	 nervous to fly, people are going to be nervous about a restaurants. And you know, the downstream
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1516.7s	1516.7	 consequences of everyone kind of locking up again, even if the government doesn't enforce lockups,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1522.4s	1522.4	 could be pretty catastrophic, especially feeling that way yourself, freeburg. In other words,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1526.6s	1526.6	 am I gonna lock myself up? Are you going to go to dinner? Are you going to go to travel to Italy or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1531.5s	1531.5	 to, you know, Japan? Or, you know, would you go to Disneyland with your kids? How is it affecting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1536.7s	1536.7	 your personal behavior being a man of science? So my personal circumstances are a little different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1542.9s	1542.9	 right now. Not to get into it. Just with my, you know, my wife's pregnant, and we're moving houses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1550.5s	1550.5	 And so we've got a bunch of reasons why we're not traveling and exposing ourselves unnecessarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1555.2s	1555.2	 right now. But I would say that at this point, you know, if all other things being equal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1562.6s	1562.6	 would I go to Disneyland with my kids? I would probably wait right now, six to 12 weeks to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1567.8s	1567.8	 what happens here. Right. So I think like if I'm feeling that way now, I think a lot of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1573.7s	1573.7	 are going to be feeling that way in the next four weeks as they hear about more friends getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1577.0s	1577.0	 COVID. Now, you know, the good news is the hospitals and so I am most concerned we were in a very,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1582.3s	1582.3	 very, very, very delicate economic recovery right now. And, you know, we have put out so much money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1587.9s	1587.9	 to stimulate this economy. Everyone is so walking on like the razor's edge to keep things, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1593.8s	1593.8	 growing. We were afraid of inflation. Lumber prices today, by the way, are lower than they were when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1598.1s	1598.1	 this whole kind of inflationary thing started and everyone was freaking out about it. So, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1602.6s	1602.6	 lumber prices are lower than they were at the start of the year, which is, you know, like a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1606.2s	1606.2	 of this kind of inflation risk has kind of come out of the equation already. So the markets have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1609.6s	1609.6	 taken that pricing out. And now we're going to be in a circumstance where people might cancel their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1614.0s	1614.0	 travel. People might cancel their restaurants. People might stop going to the office again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1618.2s	1618.2	 stop, you know, getting in the car, et cetera, et cetera. So I am most concerned about like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1623.2s	1623.2	 the psychological effects of what we're seeing with these breakthrough infections, the frequency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1628.6s	1628.6	 of them. Now, if you look at the Israel data, so Israel had zero deaths for two weeks. They're now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1633.6s	1633.6	 averaging about one death a day. And despite this, you know, huge increment, they're getting about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1638.4s	1638.4	 I think, 500 breakthrough infections a day right now. So that is good statistical news, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1643.6s	1643.6	 Statistically, these breakthrough infections are not fatal. They're not causing hospitalizations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1648.3s	1648.3	 They're, you know, if you kind of did the math going back a year and said these are the actual
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1652.4s	1652.4	 statistics of COVID, people would be like, okay, no big deal. Let's move on. It's a tough kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1657.3s	1657.3	 virus. But because of the circumstances where we are kind of under these feelings that this is a fatal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1664.3s	1664.3	 disease and could cause fatalities. Those statistics don't matter. The fear is what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1669.4s	1669.4	 matters and people are going to start to behave quite differently, I think, in the next few weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1672.5s	1672.5	 I have a slightly different point of view here. But I think, Freeberg, you're,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1677.6s	1677.6	 I think you're right in some respects. But I don't think it's going to come from people. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1682.6s	1682.6	 don't think people, I think people are exhausted and they want to go back to life as normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1688.2s	1688.2	 And I think this summer was a window into some amount of normalcy for a lot of us. And I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1694.1s	1694.1	 think we really do want to go back. And so I think what's what's really going to happen is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1700.1s	1700.1	 there's going to be essentially some form of class warfare. And instead of rich versus poor and left
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1706.5s	1706.5	 versus right, it's sort of between people who believe in science and then the, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1711.9s	1711.9	 ideologically dogmatic who refuse to get it. And that's going to play itself out economically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1717.8s	1717.8	 I agree with you, there's going to be meaningful forms of economic discrimination against people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1722.0s	1722.0	 who are unnecessarily compounding risk for the rest of us who want to deal with it, ideally,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1728.5s	1728.5	 touch wood, as a common cold, like David said, and move the fuck on. And if we are prevented
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1735.2s	1735.2	 from doing so, because economic policy and health care policy has to constantly get re rated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1741.3s	1741.3	 for a cohort of people who could protect themselves and everybody else but chooses not to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1746.2s	1746.2	 there is going to be a real pushback on that. The second thing that I think is going to happen is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1752.5s	1752.5	 politicians proved that if you give them a window to seize power, they will do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1757.9s	1757.9	 And I think what's really going to happen in the fall is if there's even a small modicum of risk,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1764.5s	1764.5	 which there will be as we just talked about, yeah, it exists now. Yeah, I think it's the politicians
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1769.3s	1769.3	 that are going to want to jump all over this and say, Okay, guys, you know, lockdowns here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1773.4s	1773.4	 you can't do this, you can't do that. So literally Gavin Newsom just did the big grand reopening,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1777.4s	1777.4	 California's back, you could see him locking it back up in September.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1780.9s	1780.9	 Or this is the best way to it's the best way to snuff out any chance of the recall going against
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1785.2s	1785.2	 them is that even if you were angry, you're not going to be allowed to basically it'll be a massive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1789.2s	1789.2	 form of voter suppression. Well, I think that that would backfire on him. That would backfire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1793.8s	1793.8	 pretty bad. You saw the flip flopping that he already did actually on schools where the government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1799.4s	1799.4	 of California basically said, Hey, you know, we're going to mandate a mask policy in the fall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1804.3s	1804.3	 And then Newsom came out because people freaked out and said, actually, no, each local municipality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1809.9s	1809.9	 can figure it out based on you know, what it what it means for them. The point is, guys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1815.7s	1815.7	 Freebrook is right. These things aren't going away. We have a cohort of people who will continue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1821.4s	1821.4	 to allow this thing to become worse than it has to be. And I think that there will be economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1827.4s	1827.4	 repercussions and discrimination against those people for that. And I think economically,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1833.6s	1833.6	 we are going to take a step back because politicians will try to slow the economy down again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1839.4s	1839.4	 And there is definitely from the right, not to get political here, but they've been pretty silent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1844.6s	1844.6	 about encouraging people to get vaccinated. And, you know, at CPAC and other places, people were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1850.9s	1850.9	 cheering the anti vax movement Mitt Romney came out, we don't control conservative media figures,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1856.6s	1856.6	 so far as I know, at least I don't. That being said, I think it's an enormous error for anyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1860.6s	1860.6	 to suggest that we shouldn't be taking vaccines. Look, the politics is politicization of vaccination
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1866.5s	1866.5	 is an outrage and frankly, moronic Mitch McConnell came out and says a polio victim myself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1871.3s	1871.3	 when I was young, I've studied that disease, I took 70 years 70 years to come up with two vaccines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1875.5s	1875.5	 that finally ended the polio threat. As a result of Operation Warp Speed, we have not one not two,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1881.5s	1881.5	 but three highly effective vaccines are perplexed by the difficulty we're having finishing the job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1886.2s	1886.2	 This is where you can expect the politically correct companies to act first, because they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1891.9s	1891.9	 the woke mob will force some action on this issue, whether you like it or not. But this is this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1898.3s	1898.3	 where the next petition will come from Apple, where the two or 3000 employees who are vaccinated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1903.4s	1903.4	 etc, who have people with, you know, people in their households with with immunologically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1909.8s	1909.8	 suppressed, and they're going to say, Hey, guys, this is crazy. Well, that that petition might be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1914.2s	1914.2	 the first application that would make sense, because those employees are directly impacted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1918.1s	1918.1	 by other employees who come to the workplace unvaccinated, unlike, you know, the issues around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1922.6s	1922.6	 Israel or Antonio's book, whatever that they shouldn't have taken a position on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1926.2s	1926.2	 Wait a second, you're saying Antonio's book wouldn't make them feel safe and getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1929.3s	1929.3	 COVID would make them unsafe? Yeah, actually, actually, yes. COVID, COVID is COVID in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1936.8s	1936.8	 workplace is a real safety issue. Not, you know, not whether somebody wrote a book five years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1941.8s	1941.8	 So so I think they do. I think employees do have a right to say to their employers, listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1946.5s	1946.5	 are we going to be a vaccinated workplace or not, because it does impact their risk. But,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1950.9s	1950.9	 but Jason, your question about should people change their behavior in light of this news,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1956.4s	1956.4	 okay, in light of the fact that we now are learning about some reduced effectiveness of the vaccines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1961.8s	1961.8	 Here's what I would tell people sitting where I am. This is not a big deal. I mean, for me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1967.2s	1967.2	 okay, it was not a big deal. It was like a mile cold, I am not going to change my I'm going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1972.2s	1972.2	 go back to normal, like my pre COVID behavior. And I would tell you, like, if you're double vax,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1978.3s	1978.3	 I don't think you need to be that afraid of this. Because, you know, my doctor said they are seeing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1982.6s	1982.6	 a bunch of these breakthrough cases, but they're all very mild. It really is like getting a cold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1986.5s	1986.5	 I'm not changing my behaviors. I made my I made my dissent. My risk assessment is if I get it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1991.9s	1991.9	 then I'm doubly protected. And I'm not going to wind up in the hospital, I'm going to focus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=1996.3s	1996.3	 all my energy on riding my bike and taking my kids out and having a good time. I'm not going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2000.3s	2000.3	 back in lockdown. So I think that's right for you. But here's where it gets a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2003.9s	2003.9	 complicated is my parents who are in their 70s, and one of them has an immune condition,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2007.7s	2007.7	 ask what they should do. And I said, Listen, if I were you guys, I would not be going to public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2012.2s	2012.2	 places, I'd be masking up, they're asking me if they should go on a trip. And I said, No,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2017.4s	2017.4	 I would actually if I were you, I would lock down until this blows over because they're at elevated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2022.8s	2022.8	 risk. And so yeah, for me, getting COVID was like a mild case, but for them, maybe it could be more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2028.6s	2028.6	 serious. So all it takes is 10% of the population acting like what you just described, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2033.7s	2033.7	 recommended to your parents sex for there to be economic ripples associated with this, this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2039.1s	2039.1	 breakthrough kind of condition for a while. And that's where I have the most concern is, again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2043.8s	2043.8	 like, you know, we're kind of you're not concerned about the debts, Friedberg, you're concerned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2047.4s	2047.4	 about the economic impact of the psychological scars that are now in place. I will explain,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2053.0s	2053.0	 I sent you guys a link to the Reuters article where they covered the press conference with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2056.6s	2056.6	 Prime Minister of Israel the other day. And basically, they are taking what they're calling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2061.3s	2061.3	 a soft suppression strategy, where they're encouraging Israelis to learn to live with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2066.8s	2066.8	 virus, involving the fewest possible restrictions and avoiding a fourth national lockdown that could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2071.9s	2071.9	 do further harm to the economy. And he said implementing the strategy will entail taking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2077.5s	2077.5	 certain risks, but in the overall consideration, including economic factors, this is the necessary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2083.6s	2083.6	 balance. And so it's a it's a it's a very kind of pointed position that they're coming to. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2089.7s	2089.7	 think the US government, the federal government is going to have to come to the same one. But we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2093.6s	2093.6	 different states and different local governments that are going to act differently. And because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2097.7s	2097.7	 we've you know, we have authority vested in those different jurisdictions, you could see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2103.4s	2103.4	 different public policy officials take different positions and what we're talking about. If San
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2107.5s	2107.5	 Francisco said restaurants have to go back to 25% capacity, it would decimate these already
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2113.2s	2113.2	 struggling small businesses and there's no more stimulus dollars available. And so you kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2117.5s	2117.5	 think about this or 10% of people cancel their vacation plans. What's that going to do to airlines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2122.3s	2122.3	 and hotels? So again, my concern is, are we about to hit a wave of economic ripples that aren't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2128.6s	2128.6	 necessarily tied to what is the right thing to do from a policy perspective or a science or health
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2133.8s	2133.8	 perspective, but really the psychological effects of the scared and concerned saying, you know what,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2139.5s	2139.5	 there's more money available. You know, we got bailed out before we'll get bailed out again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2143.7s	2143.7	 Let's implement a shutdown. Let's implement a lockdown. Let's not go to work. It's whatever the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2148.2s	2148.2	 the decision tree you may have as a business owner or policymaker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2151.4s	2151.4	 Well, there's an important point here, which is listen, COVID is going to be with us for a long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2155.2s	2155.2	 time, we're going to need to make really smart cost benefit analysis decisions in how to deal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2160.9s	2160.9	 with it. We can't go back to lockdowns because they didn't work and they're extremely expensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2165.1s	2165.1	 We spent $10 trillion battling COVID last year. We cannot do that again. We don't have the bullets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2171.8s	2171.8	 that are going to keep firing at this thing like that. We got to start making intelligent decisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2176.2s	2176.2	 Zeroism is not going to work. This idea that the premise of zeroism is that we can stamp out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2182.2s	2182.2	 every last vestige of COVID. Maybe that was even a possibility when vaccines were 99% effective,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2188.5s	2188.5	 but now that they're not, there's no chance of stamping out COVID. So we've got to learn,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2194.2s	2194.2	 like the Israel example, we've got to learn to live with this thing and make smart cost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2199.1s	2199.1	 benefit decisions. But I also think, you know, this is kind of a disaster for humanity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2204.2s	2204.2	 We now have this new category of illness that's rapidly mutating. We don't know what the end of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2209.4s	2209.4	 it's going to be. Like I said, there's 1800 variants of the common cold that's causing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2214.1s	2214.1	 these symptoms. By the way, has anyone noticed how many different symptoms this virus causes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2219.0s	2219.0	 in people? There's over 200 long-run symptoms. Well, they worked on it for a long time, David,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2223.4s	2223.4	 in fairness. Yes, exactly. Everyone knows it's a lab engineered virus that's now a plague on humanity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2229.8s	2229.8	 This is really a disaster. This is going to, I think, permanently impact human life expectancy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2236.0s	2236.0	 I mean, this is a serious problem. We could have avoided this entire thing here in the United
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2241.2s	2241.2	 States, at least. If people just took the win, how frustrating is this that we would probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2248.6s	2248.6	 have cases down to a thousand a day and deaths down to 10 a day like Israel, if we had just gotten
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2255.9s	2255.9	 everybody to take one of the billions of excess vaccines sitting on shelves and in CVSs and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2263.5s	2263.5	 Walgreens across this country. How stupid are we? We don't have the collectivism to make those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2269.5s	2269.5	 actions. If you think about what's happening in Israel, two different examples. In China,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2275.1s	2275.1	 collectivism manifests as basically a top-down form of governance. In Israel, collectivism comes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2284.5s	2284.5	 from a need for state-level security. I've traveled to Israel a lot. I've worked there. It's crazy when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2292.2s	2292.2	 you see how people cooperate together the minute you hear the missile alarms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2299.2s	2299.2	 There is a way for people to do cost-benefit analyses in Israel because it's a matter of life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2303.7s	2303.7	 or death. They've been trained to do that. Either it's imposed on you like in China,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2308.7s	2308.7	 or people bottoms up can understand these tradeoffs like in Israel. We are in a very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2313.3s	2313.3	 different place where literally what we have are three things that are in conflict with each other,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2320.2s	2320.2	 Jason. We have politics and the desire for power. We have the deconstruction of power
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2326.9s	2326.9	 by social media. Then we have the traditional media trying to stay relevant. That's a toxic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2333.1s	2333.1	 thing that's spinning around and spinning around and spinning around, trying to allocate this very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2339.6s	2339.6	 ephemeral thing called power and influence. We don't know how it works anymore. We cannot get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2345.0s	2345.0	 our shit together. Half the people care about vegan fucking milk. The other half the people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2349.8s	2349.8	 care. We are in an alternate universe. As bad as we are, Europe and even Japan have done even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2356.6s	2356.6	 worse because our government was fairly efficient about the distribution of the vaccines. In Europe,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2363.6s	2363.6	 they've just completely botched it. Same thing in Japan. We are not the worst on vaccination rates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2369.4s	2369.4	 Yes, it should be better, but this is a global problem. Well, we are the worst on capturing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2373.4s	2373.4	 the opportunity, David. We have the opportunity to have everybody vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2377.2s	2377.2	 No, let's be honest. America is the most exceptional country in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2381.3s	2381.3	 It has been for hundreds of years. It should be for several hundred more. There is no excuse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2386.6s	2386.6	 for this country to have fucked this up this badly. I've spent enough time, as you guys have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2392.8s	2392.8	 in Europe and in Japan, it's understandable why those countries are in the positions they're in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2397.8s	2397.8	 It is not understandable why America is in the position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2400.6s	2400.6	 So dumb. It's like having a 20 point lead and you just with like eight minutes to go and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2405.4s	2405.4	 just screw up and you lose the game. So stupid. All right. Do we want to move on to the billionaire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2411.4s	2411.4	 space race? Yeah, I think that's positive news. This company. What's it called? Virgin Galactic.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2423.0s	2423.0	 seems to be doing pretty well. Anybody have thoughts on Richard Branson getting to space?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2428.1s	2428.1	 I don't know. Let's just randomly go to somebody. Chama.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2431.8s	2431.8	 No, congratulations. In all seriousness, congratulations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2435.0s	2435.0	 I cried. Nat and I.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2440.8s	2440.8	 Nat and I watched it together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2444.1s	2444.1	 You cried?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2444.8s	2444.8	 And it was emotional. It's emotional because you know, I mean, being a little bit more on the inside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2451.6s	2451.6	 how hard they worked. I mean, we've all been there where we're all toiling in obscurity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2457.8s	2457.8	 where there are moments where everybody thinks that what you're doing either is crazy or isn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2461.8s	2461.8	 going to work or is going to fail. And there's a moment where you just have to push through it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2467.0s	2467.0	 right? And find people that believe in you. I think I came in very late to that, but I had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2474.0s	2474.0	 the opportunity to find these incredible people, believe in them, help them, give them capital,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2479.4s	2479.4	 which was essentially oxygen, right? That's oxygen for a company. And then to see them achieve it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2484.6s	2484.6	 it felt so special to be a part of it. So yeah, I mean, I was really emotional.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2490.2s	2490.2	 And it was it was beautiful. So I don't know, I think this is the beginning of the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2495.8s	2495.8	 I tweeted this out. But basically, if you think about, and there's other stuff that we can't talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2500.8s	2500.8	 about with some other companies that we are all involved in, David and I particularly, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2504.8s	2504.8	 here's the point, guys, between sending people and making us an interplanetary species,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2512.3s	2512.3	 by creating pervasive internet access, and by enabling us to safely and reliably transport
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2518.7s	2518.7	 people either point to point suborbitaly, or basically into space, we are completely reimagining
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2526.2s	2526.2	 how the human race can work. And I think that's incredible. And to be a part of that is really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2532.3s	2532.3	 special. There was a lot of people who got very negative on Twitter, I noticed there was a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2538.0s	2538.0	 people that said, Oh, you know, no, like, you know, maybe now we can deal with, I don't know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2542.6s	2542.6	 child hunger, or, you know, hey, why are all these billionaires doing this out of the other end?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2547.5s	2547.5	 I took a step back and I thought, my gosh, a people are there's a small virulent cohort of people that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2554.2s	2554.2	 are incredibly negative. And B doesn't even know what they're talking about. Because you're talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2560.5s	2560.5	 about issues of state responsibility and confusing it for what private citizens are doing to advance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2566.9s	2566.9	 a set of technologies that I think have broad appeal. So those are my thoughts. I mean, I was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2571.4s	2571.4	 I watched every minute of it. And I thought it was incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2574.1s	2574.1	 Just to add to that. Yeah, I want to I want to take the part that all the naysayers and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2578.4s	2578.4	 the negativity I mean, Chamath is right, all the very online people immediately came out, attacking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2585.6s	2585.6	 this extraordinary accomplishment and active bravery by Branson. I mean, this is a billionaire,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2591.0s	2591.0	 he doesn't need to be risking his life, launching himself into space. I mean, this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2595.8s	2595.8	 a courageous act, you know, he's putting his his, his life where his mouth is. And you had all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2601.7s	2601.7	 very online people, but you had one CNN commentator basically said this was bad for the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2607.3s	2607.3	 You had another one saying that calling him a tax cheat. Then there was another whiner who said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2614.4s	2614.4	 what about all the starving children in the world? I mean, it just went on and on like this. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2619.6s	2619.6	 Mike Solana had a pretty funny tweet summing up the sort of the left's argument. Thusly said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2628.1s	2628.1	 number one, this is their argument, according to Solana, one money is evil to therefore people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2633.2s	2633.2	 with money are evil. Three, therefore things people with money care about evil. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2638.1s	2638.1	 that is basically the level of sophistication. Everybody's talking about that's being made.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2643.4s	2643.4	 That's the argument that the left is making. Everybody's a bond villain. Right. But here's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2647.4s	2647.4	 the problem is that first of all, we do get tremendous benefits out of these innovators
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2653.3s	2653.3	 who are pushing the boundaries of science and technology and engineering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2658.4s	2658.4	 You know, Branson actually went on Stephen Colbert show and defended it. He said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2662.2s	2662.2	 he said, listen, I think they're not fully this is Branson. He said, I think they're not fully
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2665.9s	2665.9	 educated to what space does for earth is connecting the billions of people who are not connected
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2672.0s	2672.0	 down here. He said, every single spaceship that we've sent, putting satellites up there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2675.8s	2675.8	 monitoring different things around the world, like the degradation of rainforest,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2679.3s	2679.3	 monitoring food distribution, even monitoring things like climate change. These things are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2683.3s	2683.3	 essential for us back on earth. So we need more spaceships going up to space, not less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2688.3s	2688.3	 So, you know, they're really just kind of ignorant about the benefits of technology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2693.9s	2693.9	 And what do they want to do with the money? Anyway, you know, we've got all the yes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2697.2s	2697.2	 we do have all these problems on earth. But so many of our problems are not a problem of under
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2701.6s	2701.6	 funding. We have tons of money going to the problem of homelessness in California. It just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2705.8s	2705.8	 keeps getting worse because we have the wrong approach. We have on education, we have very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2710.6s	2710.6	 very wrong ideas. We have the wrong organization. We have the wrong execution. Fix the operating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2716.7s	2716.7	 details. It's not a money issue. Exactly. Take education in California. We have very high levels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2722.2s	2722.2	 of per pupil spending and our test scores keep going down. Why? Because we have unions controlling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2727.3s	2727.3	 the schools. There's no competition. Don't worry, David, we're getting rid of testing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2730.7s	2730.7	 We've eliminated testing. We solve that problem. We spent more as a percentage of GDP on health

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2739.7s	2739.7	 which is basically the top of the pyramid of health care is now sub 80 years old. What is going on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2746.6s	2746.6	 If all of these negative naysayers could actually just get into the arena and try to do something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2752.8s	2752.8	 right instead of whining, just stop whining instead of whining whiner class, they have no ideas,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2758.8s	2758.8	 they have no ideas, they have no solutions. They just have gripes and no ability to execute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2764.1s	2764.1	 apparently. Yeah. Why don't they come up with new programs, actually test new programs at a hyper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2769.4s	2769.4	 local level to see what works. Okay. Can I tell you why? Can I tell you why? These sort of like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2778.2s	2778.2	 leftist whiners are not motivated to actually do the hard work. Meaning even if they have an idea

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2791.4s	2791.4	 may need to spend four or five years in the bowels in obscurity just learning, paying their dues,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2805.7s	2805.7	 of the line. And they're not willing to put in the work because the minute they realize how much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2810.9s	2810.9	 actual work is demanded of progress, they run away because they're scared. And the reason they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2816.5s	2816.5	 scared is because somewhere along the way somebody tricked them that it was not actually about trying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2823.2s	2823.2	 it was actually about succeeding. And that is the biggest failure that we could do to people is all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2828.1s	2828.1	 of a sudden tricking them to believe you have to have it work. So they'd rather be hall monitors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2833.4s	2833.4	 they'd just try critics and feel rather than credit. Failure is just as good because you're

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2843.8s	2843.8	 incredible secret hiding in plain sight. Friedberg, what do you think of the space race
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2847.1s	2847.1	 and the hall monitor whiner class? If you guys look, I was going to send these statistics earlier,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2851.7s	2851.7	 but if you look at the amount of venture capital money that's gone into into private space,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2859.6s	2859.6	 companies, space technology companies, I think it was a few hundred million dollars, call it three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2864.6s	2864.6	 to $400 million pretty consistently from 2011 through 2014, pretty flat. And then in 2015,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2872.2s	2872.2	 I think this is when SpaceX started to kind of create a lot of momentum and hype that private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2876.1s	2876.1	 companies can't actually build businesses in kind of call it the space industry. The number jumped
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2882.2s	2882.2	 to 3 billion a year and then it was a little over three and a half billion and 16 and then it jumped
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2886.2s	2886.2	 to almost 5 billion and 17. It was a little bit down in 18. 2020 it's climbed to almost 10 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2892.2s	2892.2	 And in Q1 of this year, I think we're at 2 billion venture capital money going into private space
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2898.1s	2898.1	 companies. So there's clearly a great deal of momentum in this industry. The question is always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2905.0s	2905.0	 what's the market at the end? And so if you break out how do these companies make money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2910.2s	2910.2	 one is to provide services to governments, you know, launch services and taking people to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2915.8s	2915.8	 space station, what have you. And SpaceX has obviously built a tremendous business in that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2919.6s	2919.6	 There has been obviously a lot of interest in tourism. And I think it's, you know, we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2925.8s	2925.8	 seeing this first breakthrough with Virgin Galactic. And we're going to find out over the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2930.3s	2930.3	 next couple of years, is there a tourism market? Historically, there's been interest in a market for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2937.2s	2937.2	 visual satellites. But you know, if you look at some of the financials of companies like Planet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2942.5s	2942.5	 Labs, they did a few acquisitions in space imaging. And the revenue hasn't really taken off there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2948.6s	2948.6	 And then mining was always this other question is, can we go out and mine, you know, rare minerals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2952.7s	2952.7	 from space? And that one is just, you know, if you do the math on it, it's so far away, it's impossible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2957.4s	2957.4	 to kind of model. So I think over the next, and then finally, it's communications. And communications
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2962.8s	2962.8	 are cheaper to run on Earth if you're in cities versus, you know, the SpaceX model is to reach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2967.4s	2967.4	 rural areas that it's going to be more affordable to do this through space. And so, you know, there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2973.2s	2973.2	 obviously a ton of momentum and a ton of interest in private companies getting to space. Everyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2979.9s	2979.9	 right now, it seems, is trying to figure out what's the market, right? How big is the market? How big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2983.9s	2983.9	 is the business? And, you know, how quickly can you actually see that capital turn around into real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2987.7s	2987.7	 revenue? So, you know, there's this kind of market question that I think is still outstanding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=2994.6s	2994.6	 In terms of, you know, the opportunity, if you go back to like the 15th century, I think something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3001.8s	3001.8	 like 60 to 70% of ships, maritime, travel, you know, got into shipwrecks, you know, the,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3010.9s	3010.9	 you know, that's around when, you know, we sailed across the Atlantic or the Spanish sailed across
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3015.3s	3015.3	 the Atlantic or funded. Or they disappeared. Or they disappeared. I mean, they basically crashed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3019.2s	3019.2	 It didn't work. It was a one way trip, sometimes to the bottom of the ocean. If you were sitting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3024.4s	3024.4	 in Spain in 1450, and someone said, Hey, these ships, it's going to be a great business, we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3030.4s	3030.4	 going to build lots of ships and we're going to go out, maybe we'll get trade routes going, maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3033.6s	3033.6	 we'll discover new land, maybe we'll make money. Maybe we'll take people on trips on these ships.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3038.3s	3038.3	 You would be like, this is crazy. Half the people are dying. There's no market on the other side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3043.4s	3043.4	 So, you know, we are in that kind of- And you would have been totally wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3047.4s	3047.4	 Yeah. And you are in that 15th century moment right now with the space industry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3051.8s	3051.8	 Great analogy. Would anyone in the space, would anyone in the ship business in the 15th century
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3056.5s	3056.5	 have been able to predict Carnival cruise lines or been able to predict evergreen ships taking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3061.8s	3061.8	 stuff from China to America with these huge shipping crates? Would anyone have been able to predict
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3070.2s	3070.2	 going down to the bottom of the Atlantic? I mean, like all of the technology and the entire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3074.3s	3074.3	 industry that kind of came out of that set of pioneering activity in the 15th century
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3081.1s	3081.1	 transformed the planet, transformed the economy, transformed humanity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3085.6s	3085.6	 And, you know, it's very hard to sit here today and say, hey, I know where the space industry is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3092.2s	3092.2	 going. I know what's going to be possible. But I can tell you that if history is any predictor of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3096.6s	3096.6	 the future, you know, this pioneering work that's going on, which is burning tons of money and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3102.1s	3102.1	 everyone's kind of questioning whether there's businesses here, it could transform our species
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3107.0s	3107.0	 once again. So, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3109.0s	3109.0	 David, your 15th century shipping example is so beautiful. Three things that came out of that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3116.6s	3116.6	 which I think we all value. One, insurance. Two, tort law.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3123.6s	3123.6	 And carry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3124.6s	3124.6	 Exactly. And three was basically how they did risk management so that, you know, each ship would take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3130.4s	3130.4	 a little piece of everybody else's cargo so that some of the cargo would always get to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3134.3s	3134.3	 Marketplaces emerged. Lloyds of London came about. Yeah, Lloyds of London emerged because of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3138.5s	3138.5	 maritime insurance that was required. And almost all P&C insurance can trace its roots back to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3143.7s	3143.7	 maritime insurance during that era. And so these ancillary industries that emerged were like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3149.1s	3149.1	 surprising, right? It's almost business models emerged because you had to figure out how you do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3153.8s	3153.8	 the arbitrage here. And carry is the perfect example. People don't understand the venture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3157.4s	3157.4	 capital carry. We get 20% of the profits was designed so that people with ships, the captain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3162.1s	3162.1	 would get to say we get 20% of whatever makes it there. Now you're aligned, whatever makes it there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3167.6s	3167.6	 you get 20% of okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go through that storm, and I'm going to try to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3171.3s	3171.3	 it there. And we know there's so many unknowns. But just looking at the one thing, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3175.8s	3175.8	 Starlink, I was doing a little research today about internet penetration, we've got, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3180.8s	3180.8	 close to 5 billion people on the internet now. But a very small number of them are on broadband,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3185.9s	3185.9	 it's like 20%, 30%, somewhere in that number, it's hard to get an exact number there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3190.8s	3190.8	 But if you think about what's going to happen to humanity, we're talking about billions of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3195.4s	3195.4	 who did not have access to broadband, and they are going to go from not having, you know, if you think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3203.4s	3203.4	 about what we went through in the West, when the internet first came out, and we got our first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3206.6s	3206.6	 brown bag connections, you know, defined as like DSL or whatever, we had libraries, we had books,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3211.4s	3211.4	 we had colleges, we had stores everywhere, Barnes and Noble. So the internet was unbelievably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3217.4s	3217.4	 transformative. But we were in a modern society. Now you go to the developing world, and they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3222.5s	3222.5	 going to go from, you know, not even having running water in some cases in their homes or electricity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3228.1s	3228.1	 or, you know, variable to having broadband, and they're going to have access to YouTube circa 2022,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3234.8s	3234.8	 2023, they're going to have access to, you know, MIT courseware or brilliant.org and all of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3241.8s	3241.8	 information and shopping, we're going to take a billion or 2 billion people and give them broadband
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3246.9s	3246.9	 instantly within a decade, this is going to change the face of the planet. I think that that's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3253.4s	3253.4	 revolution. And it's not just Starlink doing it. There's like three competitors to Starlink.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3258.1s	3258.1	 Obviously, Starlink's got the biggest lead. Yeah, before SpaceX doing this, and there were others,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3262.9s	3262.9	 there was a company called O3B, it was stood for other 3 billion, and they had raised a ton of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3268.2s	3268.2	 money to do this. I just, by the way, I just want to speak to like a trend that we've seen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3273.3s	3273.3	 and also speak to the quality of Elon's leadership. So many companies have tried this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3281.0s	3281.0	 Google talked about it for years, which is how you can project Loon. Well, Project Loon was a follow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3285.8s	3285.8	 on to what we talked about early on at Google, which was putting up satellites. And ultimately,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3290.2s	3290.2	 Google had a satellite program that was killed in favor of buying a company called Skybox. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3296.1s	3296.1	 Skybox was this coastal ventures back startup that was trying to make a smaller scale startup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3301.0s	3301.0	 And if you guys will remember around the early 2010s, there were a bunch of startups that emerged
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3306.9s	3306.9	 that were all about building small scale satellites that could go up into low Earth orbit, and do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3313.0s	3313.0	 things like imaging and communications. And a bunch of these companies were banking on the fact that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3318.1s	3318.1	 the cost per kilogram to get your payload into space was declining pretty precipitously. So they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3323.7s	3323.7	 were like, let's make super cheap commodity, you know, space imaging or space communication boxes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3328.6s	3328.6	 put them in space. And after a couple of years, they'll fall out of orbit and burn up. But it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3332.6s	3332.6	 doesn't matter if we can get enough use out of them. And they cost so little to put into space,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3336.0s	3336.0	 and they cost a little to make, let's put hundreds of them up. So there's a company called Planet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3338.8s	3338.8	 Labs that does this, that's, I think, going public via SPAC. Now, again, they've been challenged with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3344.5s	3344.5	 building the business in imaging. But there was a Google bought a company for I think half a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3348.2s	3348.2	 billion dollars called Skybox trying to do this, which was like imaging slash comms. And they had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3352.7s	3352.7	 a bigger refrigerator size box that they were trying to put up. Ultimately, Google spun that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3358.1s	3358.1	 out to Planet Labs. And the whole thing kind of, you know, became imaging. But I just want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3362.6s	3362.6	 highlight that this has been a big trend for a while. And it speaks to the quality of Elon,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3367.0s	3367.0	 his leadership, because the fact that this guy did what 20 other 30 other people have tried,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3371.8s	3371.8	 companies have tried to do for the past decade or so. And he said, you know what, instead of just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3376.6s	3376.6	 providing the infrastructure to get all these devices into space, we're just going to build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3380.9s	3380.9	 the actual devices, get this thing up and just go crazy with it and put our capital into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3385.6s	3385.6	 And it's really impressive to see because it's such a no brainer, people have been talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3389.2s	3389.2	 this opportunity for over a decade. And these guys just have absolutely rushed the field.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3394.8s	3394.8	 And they could build an incredible business out of this. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3397.8s	3397.8	 the two most important companies in satellite communications are Starlink and Swarm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3402.8s	3402.8	 And Swarm was a company that I seeded and Saks did the Series A. And the if you talk to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3408.1s	3408.1	 founders of that company, you know, they'll give you this use case in I think it was in 2014. Do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3413.7s	3413.7	 you guys remember there was like a Malaysian Airlines flight that just disappeared? Yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3418.2s	3418.2	 disappeared. 370. Yeah, Malaysian Airlines flight 370. And it was like 230 240 people that passed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3426.3s	3426.3	 away. And the the most you know, indelible question that I remember from this was,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3434.2s	3434.2	 we we couldn't track it. And I thought myself, how is that even possible? How do you how do you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3444.2s	3444.2	 internet coverage is so sad that it only covers small areas. And it made obvious that like, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3451.5s	3451.5	 know, we should live in a world where there is absolutely pervasive internet access everywhere,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3457.7s	3457.7	 every single little shred inch of the world should be covered and saturated that should never happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3465.5s	3465.5	 You know, the people should be able to have closure, they should be able to go and get that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3469.2s	3469.2	 plane, recover the bodies, give them proper funeral. These are simple things, but they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3473.1s	3473.1	 human things that we should be doing as human beings, right? And just think about the IOT
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3476.9s	3476.9	 Internet access enables this and the idea that we can't do that is shocking. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3481.8s	3481.8	 I agree with you, Fieber. We Elon's incredible. And I think that within the next five years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3486.8s	3486.8	 we'll probably have pervasive internet access everywhere in the earth. And that's, that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3490.4s	3490.4	 transformational. You know, the the second most valuable private company in space is also a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3497.4s	3497.4	 company that, you know, I invested in led the series A called relativity space, and their idea,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3504.2s	3504.2	 which I think will help everybody that wants to go to Mars and other places is, why don't we just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3510.6s	3510.6	 3d print the rockets? And why don't we 3d print the engines? And why don't we make that functionally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3517.6s	3517.6	 useful because it basically takes the cost of a rocket and divides it by 10. And these printers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3524.0s	3524.0	 are small enough where you know, you can actually send them to dismantle them and take them with you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3529.7s	3529.7	 to Mars and set them up there and all of a sudden you can print the parts that you need to get back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3534.2s	3534.2	 to earth as an example. So I think that additive manufacturing has an enormous upside here in space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3543.8s	3543.8	 And I think that that's another area that's going to be really, really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3546.1s	3546.1	 anybody read Andy Weir's Hail Mariette, the guy who did the Martian. He's a science fiction author,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3552.6s	3552.6	 it's really great because you don't actually know what you're going to find out there. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3556.2s	3556.2	 that's one of the things that, you know, to to freeberg's point, what do we find out there? What
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3560.6s	3560.6	 if we find a compound out there that like, plutonium has some attributes that we could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3566.8s	3566.8	 leverage in very small amounts to create unlimited energy or unlimited prosperity in some ways,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3572.6s	3572.6	 there are things that can exist that we have not been exposed to. And of course,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3576.6s	3576.6	 the probability is there are many things that we have yet to be exposed to 100%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3580.8s	3580.8	 Yeah, look, I don't subscribe to that thesis. I'll tell you, I'll tell you why. And this maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3589.3s	3589.3	 also speaks a little bit to some of the counterpoints against the space industry getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3594.3s	3594.3	 the attention and resourcing it has relative to call it other places to allocate capital and human
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3599.0s	3599.0	 resourcing. And that is like the tools that we have in science and engineering today as a species
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3606.0s	3606.0	 continues to expand at kind of a geometric pace, our ability to convert any molecule into any other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3614.6s	3614.6	 molecule is basically fulfilled. Now, it's a function at this point of how much energy and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3620.9s	3620.9	 time it takes to do that work. So almost all industry the function of industries to convert
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3625.3s	3625.3	 molecules from one form to another. And we have tools ranging from hardware engineering,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3630.5s	3630.5	 mechanical engineering, and more recently in the early 20th century, chemical engineering,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3634.5s	3634.5	 and in the 21st century, biochemical engineering, those tools are allowing us to invent, discover,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3641.0s	3641.0	 and convert molecules and even in some cases, kind of elemental forms that into nearly anything else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3649.7s	3649.7	 we want to produce. And the technology is accelerating in such a way, the set of technologies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3654.3s	3654.3	 compound that if you think about 100 years from now, 200 years from now, 500 years from now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3659.2s	3659.2	 the human species theoretically, for very minimal time and very minimal energy should be able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3664.2s	3664.2	 have something that looks akin today to the Star Trek replicator. You basically type into a device
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3669.6s	3669.6	 what you'd like to make, and it makes it for you in a few minutes. And you could just like Mr. Fusion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3674.2s	3674.2	 and Back to the Future 2, you could put any input you want into the thing, you could throw in bananas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3677.9s	3677.9	 and cans and whatever, and out comes this thing you want to make. So as the human species evolved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3683.0s	3683.0	 towards that capability, and we don't need to get into the details, that's just like the general
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3687.6s	3687.6	 trend line, it becomes less relevant that we need to go get other molecules or go get other things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3693.3s	3693.3	 from extra planetary sources. The planet Earth has the order of 10 to the 23rd atoms, two-thirds of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3702.0s	3702.0	 the surface is water. There is so much that is unexplored and untapped from a resource perspective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3707.9s	3707.9	 within this spaceship that we're already on, that the argument would be made that our technology is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3713.4s	3713.4	 allowing us to effectively recreate all of our fantastic dreams right here where we live today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3718.6s	3718.6	 And the first thing we're going to have to do is fix this planet and fix the ecosystems that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3723.1s	3723.1	 kind of at risk. But as we progress and as these technologies progress, we can do these extraordinary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3728.2s	3728.2	 things that we don't necessarily need to rely on extra planetary travel and colonization in order
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3732.9s	3732.9	 to achieve those objectives. So that's the optimistic counter argument.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3737.5s	3737.5	 Yeah, but we keep finding things like these molecules in Titan's atmosphere, etc., that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3743.7s	3743.7	 can't explain, and we're finding those through telescopes, let alone we get out there. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3747.9s	3747.9	 we might be able to create them, sure, but we're going to discover them in other places. They may
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3753.8s	3753.8	 be beyond our human comprehension that these things could even exist, David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3757.4s	3757.4	 There are interesting things we're seeing there, for sure. And I think, you know, there's a, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3762.1s	3762.1	 I mentioned this book before, it's so esoteric and difficult, but it's called Every Life is on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3767.4s	3767.4	 Fire by this guy named Jeremy England. And he highlights how all of evolution is effectively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3773.0s	3773.0	 predicted by statistical physics. And the energy bath and the molecules within a system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3779.4s	3779.4	 create a structure of molecules that you wouldn't see except for that condition, meaning that over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3786.5s	3786.5	 time, the complexity of that system evolves to create an equilibrium with the energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3793.0s	3793.0	 that it's covered in. So what we see on planet Earth, he argues, is organic molecules in what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3798.9s	3798.9	 we call life, which are these molecules that are really good at copying themselves to absorb
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3803.5s	3803.5	 energy and dissipate energy. So the molecules and the energy state of Titan is different than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3809.7s	3809.7	 what we see at Earth. So the way the molecules have evolved there are so different than what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3813.3s	3813.3	 we've seen on Earth. And you can see these incredible concepts of what we wouldn't call
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3817.5s	3817.5	 life today, but really could be defined as life there. And so there's certainly a lot to learn,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3822.2s	3822.2	 a lot to explore. It doesn't mean that we're limited in terms of our ability to kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3826.2s	3826.2	 realize those things here on planet Earth. But you're absolutely right. Like exploration is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3831.2s	3831.2	 the core of being a human, right? And for people who don't know, Titan is one of the,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3835.3s	3835.3	 it's the largest moon of Saturn. And it's got its own really weird dense atmosphere that's icy and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3842.7s	3842.7	 slushy. And we don't even, we can't even comprehend half the stuff going on there yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3847.5s	3847.5	 Would any of you guys take the Richard Branson trip? Would you do the, you know, like next week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3853.8s	3853.8	 or two years? I guess at what point would you be comfortable taking it? I'm sure you've taken your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3857.7s	3857.7	 side. I can answer for Saks. The answer is no. 600 and 600 and something. So how many flights
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3863.9s	3863.9	 more would you want to see? You would want to do 10 more flights, 20 more flights?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3868.1s	3868.1	 No, I feel really confident that we know what we're doing. This flight was so critical because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3872.6s	3872.6	 it was about figuring out what it was like to have passengers in the back and how they'd all behave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3877.4s	3877.4	 when you had multiple folks. And I think once that readout is done and Richard apparently took a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3882.4s	3882.4	 bunch of notes, so, you know, we'll be starting commercial ops, I think, you know, the next two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3890.1s	3890.1	 or three quarters. So, yeah, when you have sex. Well, I mean, if I had a $500 million super yacht
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3899.2s	3899.2	 like Jeff Bezos, that's where I'd be hanging out. I don't think I'd be blasting. I wouldn't be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3903.3s	3903.3	 blasting myself into space, but I mean, look more power to them. I mean, they got, you know, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3909.0s	3909.0	 certainly have got, yeah, he's doing both. Yeah. J Cal, would you do it? I, you know, I, my, my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3916.6s	3916.6	 theory is with kids, I kind of think differently about it. But if I was over 70, like Branson,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3922.8s	3922.8	 certainly I would do it. Yeah, I would have to have that conversation with my spouse and my kids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3927.1s	3927.1	 and say, you know, hey, this opportunity exists. They've done, let's call it 100 flights. Somewhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3935.0s	3935.0	 in that neighborhood, I would I think I would feel pretty comfortable doing it. But I would want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3938.3s	3938.3	 check in with my family and kids and see if we were all in sync on taking that level. I stopped
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3943.3s	3943.3	 riding motorcycles as an example. I think that flying in space tourism in the next year or two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3948.7s	3948.7	 will be safer than riding a motorcycle. And then eventually it'll be safer than, you know, driving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3954.6s	3954.6	 a car or something. It's quite possible. I was I was watching a space show with my daughter. She's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3960.1s	3960.1	 three years old on the couch the other day. And then she she was like, oh, space, it looks so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3966.2s	3966.2	 fun. And I'm like, make you I said, do you want to go to space? And she said, she looked back at me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3970.2s	3970.2	 and she said, I want to go to space with you. And it made me cry. It was the first time I'd
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3973.6s	3973.6	 ever thought like, man, I first time you'd ever cried for some ever cried. We just uploaded that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3977.9s	3977.9	 to his firmware. Yeah, crying. I was like, what are these water particles on my chin? But I had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3984.0s	3984.0	 I had like no desire, I would say before she said that to go to space. But it was a can I can I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3989.9s	3989.9	 can I give you an idea moment that like, man, this like, moment of like inspiration of like going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=3995.6s	3995.6	 space is something that like, I think is going to inspire, you know, a generation. And I told my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4000.8s	4000.8	 daughter, I said, you know, you are going to go to space. I hope I can be there with you. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4005.9s	4005.9	 Can I give you an idea? Two different ideas, but they're roughly related. When each of your kids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4011.4s	4011.4	 turn 18, buy them a ticket to space so that they become an astronaut, which I think is like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4017.7s	4017.7	 beautiful kind of an idea where like, you know, what an incredible present to give somebody as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4021.4s	4021.4	 they mature into aged, you know, if you if you read if you if you basically have heard all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4025.8s	4025.8	 astronauts have said, you know, the the overview effect, like when you're above the earth looking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4030.9s	4030.9	 down, it has this completely transformational effect on your outlook on life and the planet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4037.4s	4037.4	 And so, you know, to the extent that that's a quantifiable thing to give that to your child
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4042.9s	4042.9	 seems like an enormous gift, or, or when everybody's of age or whatever, where all of you guys go as a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4049.8s	4049.8	 family so that the whole cabin is your family, that would be really cool to either of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4053.7s	4053.7	 ideas. I will do one of those two. Hold on a second, Shabath. There were four people correct
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4057.9s	4057.9	 on this flight, if I remember correctly. This one, there's four passengers. Yeah. Okay, wait a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4061.9s	4061.9	 There are four besties. How are you not setting up a flight for the 100th episode of all in to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4069.5s	4069.5	 on Virgin Galactic? Can you imagine watching David cry and be so scared? I mean, I can pretty much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4075.6s	4075.6	 guarantee you, obviously, you guys have to buy tickets, but I can pretty much guarantee you that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4080.2s	4080.2	 if the three of you decided to buy tickets, I'm pretty sure I can organize that we all go on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4086.2s	4086.2	 same flight. That would be a ratings bonanza. That's all I need is to be entombed with you guys for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4094.4s	4094.4	 eternity. You know you want it. You know you want it. Hey, can you address the von Karman line
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4103.9s	4103.9	 controversy around you know, what's the right point to be in space? Because it came up a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4108.4s	4108.4	 this week in the news. I didn't want to kind of bring it up by one person. Well, no, no, there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4112.6s	4112.6	 was people talk about on the news and stuff like maybe you can just share for everyone. Blue origin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4116.4s	4116.4	 being lame. Honestly, that's so petty by Bezos. Maybe just share what happened and kind of, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4122.3s	4122.3	 know, the point of view on this be awesome. But basically, the question is what defines space,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4127.4s	4127.4	 right? So, if you if you just like start from the bottom from ground level, right, you have the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4136.1s	4136.1	 trophosphere, right? So you have like the first kind of like 1020 kilometers or so, right? Then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4142.4s	4142.4	 you have the stratosphere, right? That's where like a lot of like weather balloon activity happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4148.4s	4148.4	 That's a 50 kilometers, then you have the mesosphere, right? That's where you'll see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4151.7s	4151.7	 things like meteors and stuff. Then you get to basically the Karman line, which is around,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4156.9s	4156.9	 I don't know, 100 kilometers or so, there are a bunch of countries that either have no opinion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4163.7s	4163.7	 or point to this kind of group to define what the beginning of space is. And they define that at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4171.8s	4171.8	 about 100 clicks, which is I want to say 62 miles, okay. Then there's the United States
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4179.1s	4179.1	 and the DOD and NASA, etc. And we define it at a different level, 50 odd miles. And so, in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4189.2s	4189.2	 United States, you need to pass the US regulatory body's definition of what the threshold of space
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4196.7s	4196.7	 is to be considered an astronaut. There is other countries that would then point to a different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4204.3s	4204.3	 line, the Karman line has the line. I think the point is, it's all much ado about nothing. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4210.7s	4210.7	 in the end, I think Virgin stated that they went to 52 and a half or 53 and a half. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4217.4s	4217.4	 things are iterative. So over time, folks will get higher and higher. But the point is, okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4224.6s	4224.6	 and what? You basically go into space, you get to see the planet, you get to feel microgravity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4230.4s	4230.4	 you get the benefit of the overview effect, whether you're at 52 and a half, I'm guessing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4234.7s	4234.7	 you'll get the same effect at 58 or 60 or 61. And then you come back to Earth. So I thought it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4241.3s	4241.3	 kind of a little cheap and unnecessary. Because there's nothing experience wise that changes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4248.9s	4248.9	 right? I mean, like the understanding. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4251.8s	4251.8	 Lou origin did a tweet from the beginning, New Shepard was designed to fly above the Karman line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4256.3s	4256.3	 Lou origin did a tweet from the beginning, New Shepard was designed to fly above the Karman line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4261.0s	4261.0	 So none of our astronauts would have an asterisk next to their name. For 96% of the world's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4266.2s	4266.2	 population space begins 100 kilometers up in the interest of a blah, it's just like, why would they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4271.0s	4271.0	 do that the days before the Richard Branson goes up? It's just totally classless. It shows that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4276.2s	4276.2	 Bezos has a competitive streak, which is just not graceful, I would say. And I think there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4284.6s	4284.6	 little bit of bitterness there. And then you look at Elon, what did Elon do he went so classy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4290.2s	4290.2	 he went so classy, he took a picture with Branson and he went to support him and wrote a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4295.8s	4295.8	 congratulatory tweet. Elon does not feel he's in competition. But for some reason, Bezos,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4301.4s	4301.4	 you know, Bezos had to, like draft and approve this specific tweet from blue origin. And I just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4307.1s	4307.1	 thought it was classless. And just stupid, Jeff, really made you look so bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4311.8s	4311.8	 Elon, Elon was so fabulous. I mean, it just shows you like what a class act he is and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4316.2s	4316.2	 what he cares about, which is like he cares about advancing humans and our ability to do things that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4324.6s	4324.6	 are incredible and inspiring. And when other people do it, he's not zero sum about it. As you said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4330.3s	4330.3	 Jason, he was there, he was supportive. It was just lovely to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4335.0s	4335.0	 I think Bezos is still stung for when Elon said he couldn't get it up. Meaning he couldn't get his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4341.3s	4341.3	 rocket into space. So I don't know if that was that was too classy of Elon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4346.1s	4346.1	 Well, it was funny. It was funny. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4349.6s	4349.6	 Well, I don't know if you guys have seen Jeff's rocket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4353.5s	4353.5	 Kind of small. His rocket is I mean, it's kind of tiny rocket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4361.2s	4361.2	 Just so we put a pin in it, Melvin Capital, the people who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4366.0s	4366.0	 went to war with the Reddit traders or vice versa lost $5 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4369.7s	4369.7	 Couldn't happen to a nicer group of people. I mean, they're down 46%, which is just shocking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4376.9s	4376.9	 in and of itself in this kind of upmarket. But then to actually quantify it, they lost $5 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4384.0s	4384.0	 fighting a bunch of self-proclaimed Rs. I won't say the word because I don't want to get canceled,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4389.1s	4389.1	 but they call themselves Rs on reddit. Redditors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4394.7s	4394.7	 Redditors. They cost them $5 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4397.1s	4397.1	 Jason, you can say it. You're not calling them that. They call themselves that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4401.3s	4401.3	 They call themselves that. Yes. All right. Listen, love you besties.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4405.8s	4405.8	 Saks, we're glad that you're safe and you're healthy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4409.4s	4409.4	 No thanks to you. No, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4410.8s	4410.8	 No jokes. I didn't put any jokes in there. I have so many jokes. I'm going to save them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4415.5s	4415.5	 I mean, honestly, my thought on your recovery is no comment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4421.0s	4421.0	 I'm just jealous you're going to lose another five freaking pounds because of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4424.1s	4424.1	 Oh, yeah. I'm down to 178, by the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4426.2s	4426.2	 Come on, stop. Are you really? Manorexic. I can't even break one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4430.6s	4430.6	 When are you going to stop? Was there a bet or no?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4432.9s	4432.9	 No bet. I don't lose that bet. That'd be like me playing sacks and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4436.7s	4436.7	 chess. It's just not. Jason, what are you tipping the scales at right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4440.2s	4440.2	 190. 190 and you're about to come to Italy and basically you're going to gain 15 pounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4446.7s	4446.7	 No, I'm doing one meal a day. One meal a day. That's it. One meal a day. That's it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4452.9s	4452.9	 I'm eating one meal a day. How are you going to turn down the food?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4456.2s	4456.2	 What if you eat for three hours in that one meal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4458.2s	4458.2	 I just I try everything. I'll just try and then I have discipline now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4461.4s	4461.4	 Just like I stopped using Twitter. I'm stopping Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4463.9s	4463.9	 Can I tell one funny story about J Cal in Italy talking about discipline?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4467.7s	4467.7	 Okay, so we were there in Italy. When was this J Cal? A few years ago, whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4471.8s	4471.8	 This is a long time ago. Is this when we were in Venice?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4474.2s	4474.2	 Yeah, you were with Jade and I was with Jacqueline.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4476.7s	4476.7	 Oh, that's a great story. And we went to some ice cream place,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4479.7s	4479.7	 right? And so we all had these gelato with like two scoops or whatever on there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=95&t=4486.1s	4486.1	 So Jason finishes his in like five seconds. It would just disappear.
