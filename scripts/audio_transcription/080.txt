https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=234.9s	234.9	 Sacks commentary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=237.1s	237.1	 Well, I mean, it felt a little bit scorched earth to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=240.8s	240.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=242.3s	242.3	 I thought mine was fine, but I think these other guys are a little bit shell shocked right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=246.6s	246.6	 I went a little hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=248.8s	248.8	 I actually wrote this for your birthday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=251.8s	251.8	 And then I decided to throw it in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=253.1s	253.1	 OK, well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=254.2s	254.2	 I guess maybe we save it for your birthday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=256.2s	256.2	 Yeah, you may want to do something funnier for my birthday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=259.4s	259.4	 I'll be back next week with some actually funny intro material.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=262.8s	262.8	 Apologies to the audience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=280.6s	280.6	 All right. All right. Listen, stocks and crypto have plummeted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=282.8s	282.8	 Tiger Coinbase, Shopify, employee RSUs, meme stocks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=286.2s	286.2	 It's all gone, everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=287.9s	287.9	 The world's over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=290.7s	290.7	 So where do we start?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=293.3s	293.3	 You guys want to start with crypto stocks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=298.5s	298.5	 Where do we even begin?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=300.2s	300.2	 Should we talk about what happened when rates went to zero
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=304.4s	304.4	 and how financial assets inflated?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=306.9s	306.9	 And I think we talked about this during the pandemic, right when the pandemic was starting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=310.9s	310.9	 Chamath, I remember an early show we did where you and I talked about how it felt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=315.8s	315.8	 like we were going into like the roaring rapids, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=318.9s	318.9	 It like Magic Mountain or Disneyland.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=320.3s	320.3	 I kind of described it like that, like it feels like you're going to a rushing river.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=323.8s	323.8	 And there was just all this capital flowing so fast, like overnight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=328.2s	328.2	 There were like all of a sudden we went from this like covid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=331.3s	331.3	 standstill to, oh, my God, this rush of capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=335.2s	335.2	 And you could feel it, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=336.4s	336.4	 All the businesses were all involved in started getting term
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=339.0s	339.0	 sheets and doing deals and there was SPACs and transactions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=342.4s	342.4	 It was an incredible rush of capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=345.0s	345.0	 And so when the central bank made interest rates zero
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=348.7s	348.7	 and then banks could lend out money at close to zero and still make money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=353.8s	353.8	 and then people could lever up assets and then those asset values inflated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=357.5s	357.5	 and they could borrow more and keep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=359.8s	359.8	 You know, investing in more and buying more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=361.6s	361.6	 Ultimately, you know, we had bubble after bubble,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=364.5s	364.5	 and we saw a lot of things that, you know, may not have necessarily been valued
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=370.2s	370.2	 based on a historical set of multiples or comparables or cash flow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=375.0s	375.0	 But really, it was just about, hey, if I invest X dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=377.7s	377.7	 and someone else is willing to pay Y dollars for this asset tomorrow,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=381.5s	381.5	 I'm going to make money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=382.4s	382.4	 And, you know, suddenly the friggin vacuum came out, which was like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=386.4s	386.4	 let's take all that money back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=387.9s	387.9	 And so when interest rates got hiked, it was like all that money's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=390.4s	390.4	 coming back out of the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=391.5s	391.5	 And it was like this whooshing sound, like the airlock got opened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=394.9s	394.9	 and all the cash came back out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=397.1s	397.1	 And as a result, the bubble is just all deflated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=399.6s	399.6	 And it happened so quickly that it's what was crazy to me was that for so long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=405.0s	405.0	 Everyone's been talking about how everything feels so overvalued.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=408.6s	408.6	 So everyone was just waiting for the moment when the whooshing sound began.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=412.8s	412.8	 And then everyone laid off all the risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=414.8s	414.8	 And it happened so fast. And it's still happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=417.0s	417.0	 People are still trying to unwind the things where they're,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=419.3s	419.3	 you know, in huge positions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=420.5s	420.5	 But, you know, I think it really is just.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=424.8s	424.8	 It really is this this kind of incredible moment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=428.0s	428.0	 where you see all the money get pumped in, it all gets rushed out just as fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=432.4s	432.4	 And I think we're all kind of like, you know, in awe at how quickly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=435.6s	435.6	 the response has been.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=437.2s	437.2	 So maybe some context is helpful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=440.3s	440.3	 From 2018 up until the beginning,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=443.6s	443.6	 or not really the beginning of this year, but probably Q4 of last year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=450.0s	450.0	 You could have calculated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=453.6s	453.6	 an incredibly tight correlation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=456.6s	456.6	 between the stock market and the Fed money printer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=461.4s	461.4	 So the Fed is in control of how they can introduce dollars into the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=465.8s	465.8	 How do they do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=467.0s	467.0	 They literally manifest money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=469.8s	469.8	 They don't actually technically print it, but let's just assume
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=472.2s	472.2	 for these purposes that they actually do print it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=475.0s	475.0	 And they literally take that money and they enter the market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=477.6s	477.6	 and they buy things with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=478.8s	478.8	 And they're giving you this newly created money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=480.9s	480.9	 that they just created out of thin air.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=483.7s	483.7	 From 19 or from 2018 up until about Q4 of last year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=487.5s	487.5	 there was a 0.92 correlation between that and the S&P 500 going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=493.9s	493.9	 What does that mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=495.1s	495.1	 So if you look at a negative one correlation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=499.2s	499.2	 that means that if something goes up, this thing goes down dollar for dollar,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=503.9s	503.9	 that would be perfectly negatively correlated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=507.4s	507.4	 If you look at something that has a zero correlation, that means it's just random.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=511.1s	511.1	 Whether one thing goes up and down has no influence on the other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=515.1s	515.1	 But a 0.92% correlation effectively means that for every dollar the Fed created,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=520.4s	520.4	 the stock market was going up by that same dollar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=522.8s	522.8	 And that is literally what we had up until November of 2021.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=528.4s	528.4	 Since the beginning of this year till about yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=531.9s	531.9	 So I think the number is still going up, probably by at least by a trillion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=536.1s	536.1	 We have destroyed collectively as a society
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=540.5s	540.5	 35 trillion dollars in global market value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=544.8s	544.8	 Now, to give you a sense of that, that's 14% of all global wealth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=552.2s	552.2	 that has been destroyed in basically five months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=555.2s	555.2	 And for reference, in 2008, when we went through, you know, a cataclysmic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=559.7s	559.7	 shock to the system that threatened the banking infrastructure of America
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=563.9s	563.9	 and a potential contagion to the world, that destroyed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=567.2s	567.2	 19% of the world's global wealth at that point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=570.4s	570.4	 So, you know, we're approaching some really crazy, heady moments in time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=577.2s	577.2	 where in terms of the market correction and the value destruction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=581.1s	581.1	 The difference here is that the last time around, it was really about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=585.6s	585.6	 a handful of financial institutions and some very specific assets, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=591.6s	591.6	 Mortgage backed securities, you know, some parts of the of the credit market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=596.4s	596.4	 and then a bunch of financial stocks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=598.9s	598.9	 And that was largely it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=600.7s	600.7	 This time around, as you just said, Friberg, it's literally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=603.8s	603.8	 everything that's getting smoked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=605.4s	605.4	 There is not a place that you can effectively hide that has been safe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=609.7s	609.7	 Crypto smoked the credit markets totally frozen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=613.9s	613.9	 The equity markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=615.2s	615.2	 Nasdaq is in a bear market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=616.9s	616.9	 The S&P is basically flirting with the bear market now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=620.1s	620.1	 And I don't really see any end in sight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=622.7s	622.7	 Meanwhile, we're waiting for CPI to down tick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=626.0s	626.0	 Inflation hasn't really done that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=628.4s	628.4	 It looks like consumer price index.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=631.8s	631.8	 How much stuff cost?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=632.8s	632.8	 So that's taking a lot longer than we thought to sort of rollover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=636.3s	636.3	 Separately, jobless claims are now starting to tick up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=639.0s	639.0	 which means that companies are beginning to affect layoffs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=641.4s	641.4	 because they feel this pressure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=643.2s	643.2	 So now you're going to see an unemployment rate that starts to go up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=646.8s	646.8	 And then meanwhile, we're fighting a proxy war in the Ukraine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=650.2s	650.2	 against Russia to the tune of about, you know, 40 billion dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=653.8s	653.8	 every sort of month or so when we open the paper and decide to read about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=658.1s	658.1	 So you put all these things together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=659.4s	659.4	 It's not clear that there is the momentum to create a market bottom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=663.4s	663.4	 Real estate, Chamath, if you look at it, was a major compression in 2008.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=668.8s	668.8	 Real estate held up, is holding up, seems to be holding up a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=671.4s	671.4	 I don't know how that long that's going to last with mortgages going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=673.8s	673.8	 So when you were talking about all the different categories,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=675.8s	675.8	 I was like, that's the one category that I guess hasn't fallen yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=679.0s	679.0	 Sax, what's your take on this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=680.2s	680.2	 Yeah, I mean, look, we're in a stock market crash that I think over the last week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=684.2s	684.2	 sort of became a panic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=685.3s	685.3	 I mean, I think now there's panic selling going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=687.3s	687.3	 That's not to say that it's all oversold, but certainly there are names
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=690.6s	690.6	 now that are starting to become screaming buys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=693.3s	693.3	 But nobody has the capital to to buy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=696.0s	696.0	 I mean, it's easy to say, you know, in theory that you should be greedy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=699.8s	699.8	 when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=702.4s	702.4	 The problem is that everyone's already fully deployed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=705.2s	705.2	 And then when the stock market crashes, they got no cash left to buy up new names.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=708.4s	708.4	 And, you know, that's one of the things that you've noticed in this downturn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=712.3s	712.3	 And I'd say especially with crypto is with all the other crypto downturns,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=716.1s	716.1	 there were always, you know, the crypto accounts saying HODL or buy the dip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=720.6s	720.6	 or, you know, they had the laser eyes going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=723.1s	723.1	 I don't see any of that right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=724.5s	724.5	 No, pure capitulation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=726.8s	726.8	 Exactly. Yeah, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=728.2s	728.2	 So this is just a route across the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=731.3s	731.3	 I agree. It's every asset class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=732.8s	732.8	 I think home prices, that's coming, Jason, because, like you said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=737.0s	737.0	 mortgages are going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=738.1s	738.1	 Inventory is going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=740.5s	740.5	 So that's a leading indicator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=742.6s	742.6	 People can't afford the same mortgage they did before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=746.0s	746.0	 because rates are going up very fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=748.0s	748.0	 So, you know, sellers are going to have to drop prices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=751.6s	751.6	 And until they're willing to do that, the inventories go up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=755.0s	755.0	 That's a little dance that happens in real estate is the sellers don't want to accept reality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=758.6s	758.6	 and they don't have to sell because they're living in it, as opposed to their crypto holdings,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=762.1s	762.1	 which they're not living in and they're not getting value from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=765.2s	765.2	 And frankly, I think the consumer in general, that's the next shoe to drop here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=769.9s	769.9	 because right now it's been you had this sort of financial correction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=774.6s	774.6	 You had this massive asset inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=776.7s	776.7	 And now that the sort of the the air has come out of the balloon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=780.2s	780.2	 But the consumer has generally been holding up pretty well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=783.4s	783.4	 Obviously, we had unemployment near three percent, very low,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=787.2s	787.2	 although the labor participation wasn't great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=788.8s	788.8	 But the consumer was doing fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=790.6s	790.6	 It was sort of holding up the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=792.5s	792.5	 Now, I think you've got a bunch of different factors are going to really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=795.5s	795.5	 hurt the consumer over the next several months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=797.2s	797.2	 Like you said, interest rates going up means that home loans become more expensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=801.3s	801.3	 Car loans, any other, you know, personal consumption loans go up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=806.5s	806.5	 Credit card debt now has all of a sudden skyrocketed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=810.4s	810.4	 So there's an article on Axios on this, that the amount of consumer debt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=816.1s	816.1	 is surging and to this highest level of increase in over a decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=821.8s	821.8	 So consumers are turning to plastic to cover the soaring cost of everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=825.6s	825.6	 And then because of inflation, that wages in real terms fell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=830.9s	830.9	 two point six percent over the past year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=833.3s	833.3	 So inflation, when you say inflation, so if you're to look at wages in real terms,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=837.8s	837.8	 people are actually making less money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=840.0s	840.0	 You give somebody a 10 percent raise, eight percent inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=842.9s	842.9	 It nets out to two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=844.8s	844.8	 Well, no, you're giving them a six percent raise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=847.2s	847.2	 Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=848.6s	848.6	 Or like like a five point six percent raise or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=851.9s	851.9	 It gets eight percent inflation and net net.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=854.2s	854.2	 They're down two point six percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=856.0s	856.0	 They're down to not up in purchasing power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=858.9s	858.9	 Exactly. In spending power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=860.9s	860.9	 Sax's point is like, I mean, the number was 60 billion of new consumer credit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=865.2s	865.2	 last month, which is like something we haven't seen in a very long time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=868.7s	868.7	 as consumers try and bridge this gap to afford the things that they've gotten
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=871.6s	871.6	 used to spending money on to jump up like that just indicates that we may be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=875.6s	875.6	 in the beginning of a consumer credit bubble now, which is scary. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=879.3s	879.3	 This is this is the question is, what are the next shoes to drop?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=881.8s	881.8	 So so you think about like what's happened in the market so so far?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=885.0s	885.0	 It's mainly been multiple, multiple compression.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=888.1s	888.1	 Like earnings season was pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=890.4s	890.4	 I mean, it was amazing for some folks. Yeah. For some folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=892.9s	892.9	 So the stocks that got hammered were generally the covid stocks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=895.8s	895.8	 It was the Pelotons, the Netflix, Zoom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=899.3s	899.3	 You know, you could like Coinbase and Robin Hood with the day traders,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=902.6s	902.6	 because that was people are laying off that stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=904.8s	904.8	 So but so basically the covid stocks have been hammered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=907.4s	907.4	 But the B2B stocks actually had really good results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=911.5s	911.5	 And yet, you know, the SAS index is down like 80 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=916.1s	916.1	 The average SAS multiple, it was over 15 times,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=920.4s	920.4	 you know, last year in the on the public comps and now it's down to five point six.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=925.4s	925.4	 So the SAS companies have been hammered despite having great earnings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=928.8s	928.8	 So we don't know now they're B2B.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=931.1s	931.1	 They don't they're a little bit insulated from the consumer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=933.3s	933.3	 But what we don't know is what happens over the next six months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=936.9s	936.9	 If we go into a deep recession,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=939.0s	939.0	 then do even the B2B companies start being impacted?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=941.4s	941.4	 That would look like sex, just to be clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=944.4s	944.4	 You know, people maybe start canceling their Netflix or they don't take that vacation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=948.8s	948.8	 That's the consumer getting hit first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=950.3s	950.3	 A business that's laying off 10 or 25 percent of their employees,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=953.1s	953.1	 which are starting to see that contagion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=954.9s	954.9	 They might also pull out their SAS bill and say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=957.2s	957.2	 here's 12 SAS products we're playing for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=959.4s	959.4	 Let's consolidate down to eight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=960.9s	960.9	 Right. I've got a SAS startup that sells, you know, six and seven figure deals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=965.1s	965.1	 into enterprises, and they close their deal with Uber
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=968.8s	968.8	 the day before Dara's memo came out saying we got to be really focused on cost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=972.1s	972.1	 cutting what Wall Street wants now is free cash flow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=974.2s	974.2	 Yeah, we got to really sharpen our pencils.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=976.0s	976.0	 They were like, shoot, good thing we got this across the finish line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=978.6s	978.6	 If it had been like two days later, it just would have been a much tougher process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=981.9s	981.9	 So first, you're right, the companies that get impact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=984.6s	984.6	 are the ones with exposure to the consumer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=986.0s	986.0	 But then those companies start sharpening their pencils and buying less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=989.4s	989.4	 So the question is, how much are earnings now going to be impacted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=993.6s	993.6	 in the B2B space and what sort of recession do we have?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=997.6s	997.6	 I think like recession now is this inevitable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1000.1s	1000.1	 To Tomas's point, you can't have 14 percent of global wealth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1004.0s	1004.0	 wiped out practically overnight and not have that translate into a big recession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1008.3s	1008.3	 Monetary velocity is going to slow dramatically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1011.4s	1011.4	 The money circulating around is you can feel the brakes happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1015.1s	1015.1	 You can feel that the tightening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1016.8s	1016.8	 People are just way poorer than they were six months ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1019.5s	1019.5	 Guys, just to be clear, we actually haven't started to remove the money in the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1023.5s	1023.5	 So the process of quantitative tightening,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1026.6s	1026.6	 which is the Fed's mechanism of removing liquidity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1030.2s	1030.2	 is going to start now to the tune of about 90 billion dollars a month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1034.8s	1034.8	 But to run off all the money that they printed will still take three years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1039.5s	1039.5	 So we have to take about three trillion dollars of excess capital out of the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1044.8s	1044.8	 And so if you add that three trillion as well, that's just going to disappear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1048.6s	1048.6	 to the 14 trillion we've already, you know, or the 14 percent, the 35 trillion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1053.3s	1053.3	 Sorry. You know, you're you're starting to touch numbers that are, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1056.4s	1056.4	 as bad as the GFC in terms of global wealth destruction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1059.8s	1059.8	 And again, you're referring to the great financial crisis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1062.9s	1062.9	 When you say GFC, you're like the GFC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1065.7s	1065.7	 This wealth destruction is touching a lot of normal everyday folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1069.7s	1069.7	 in very broad based ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1072.4s	1072.4	 And that wasn't necessarily the case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1073.9s	1073.9	 There were a lot of people that unfortunately lost their home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1077.3s	1077.3	 But even that was still relatively contained to the hundreds of thousands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1080.7s	1080.7	 Here we're talking about tens of millions of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1083.6s	1083.6	 owning every kind of imaginable asset class
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1087.2s	1087.2	 who's seen wealth destruction, you know, somewhere between 25 to 90 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1093.4s	1093.4	 And that's very hard to freeburg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1094.8s	1094.8	 Yeah, but I just want to make the case like people keep using this term
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1097.5s	1097.5	 wealth destruction, and it was only wealth that was accumulated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1101.5s	1101.5	 in the last few quarters since we had covid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1104.4s	1104.4	 And we released all this capital and made interest rates zero
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1107.7s	1107.7	 and flooded the market with money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1109.4s	1109.4	 So everyone kind of gets the money and then they're like, hey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1112.0s	1112.0	 I'm worth a lot more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1113.7s	1113.7	 And then all of a sudden, the free money is taken back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1115.8s	1115.8	 And you're like, oh, my gosh, I'm worth less. I've been destroyed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1118.6s	1118.6	 It's you know, it's crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1120.0s	1120.0	 The reality is this was meant to stimulate the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1123.4s	1123.4	 Money was released.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1124.9s	1124.9	 And the idea when you release capital from a central bank
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1128.1s	1128.1	 is that that capital flows its way into productive assets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1131.5s	1131.5	 meaning businesses that can employ people, that can create products
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1134.9s	1134.9	 that people want to consume.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1136.4s	1136.4	 And ultimately, it's very hard to manage that when your only mechanism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1140.8s	1140.8	 is to raise or lower interest rates and make capital available or buy bonds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1144.6s	1144.6	 At the end of the day, a lot of that capital flowed into financial assets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1149.4s	1149.4	 and inflated the value of those assets, the value of stocks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1153.1s	1153.1	 the value of crypto, the value of bonds that we own,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1155.9s	1155.9	 the value of startups that we all own and all of those assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1159.2s	1159.2	 The value of the stock went up, but the capital didn't necessarily flow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1163.1s	1163.1	 into creating new jobs, creating new businesses and creating new products.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1166.3s	1166.3	 I want to finish this one because I think it's really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1169.0s	1169.0	 And at the end of the day, if that capital didn't really go into create value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1173.4s	1173.4	 and it comes back out and all that happened was we had this kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1176.3s	1176.3	 inflationary moment in terms of asset prices and we didn't actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1180.2s	1180.2	 create new jobs and didn't actually stimulate the real productive economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1184.2s	1184.2	 That's where we have a problem with stagflation and where we are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1187.2s	1187.2	 inevitably going to run into a recession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1189.2s	1189.2	 And I think the biggest concern I have, let's be honest,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1191.6s	1191.6	 we're in a recession right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1192.8s	1192.8	 This is the second quarter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1194.0s	1194.0	 The biggest concern I have, as I mentioned earlier,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1197.3s	1197.3	 is this consumer credit problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1199.2s	1199.2	 A lot of consumers got used to the free money over the past two years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1202.9s	1202.9	 And people took that money and they went and bought new cars or they bought
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1206.4s	1206.4	 crypto or they bought one thing or another, NFTs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1209.3s	1209.3	 And a lot of people got used to living a lifestyle that allowed them to spend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1212.8s	1212.8	 in a way that they otherwise would not have been able to spend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1215.9s	1215.9	 And then all of a sudden, the rug got pulled out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1219.0s	1219.0	 And now everyone's like, well, I want to keep living this lifestyle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1221.8s	1221.8	 I want to keep spending this money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1223.2s	1223.2	 I want to. I had all this stuff taken away from me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1225.7s	1225.7	 Shoot, what am I going to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1227.2s	1227.2	 And then they take on credit and the credit markets haven't tightened enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1231.2s	1231.2	 yet on the consumer side that we may find ourselves in a really ugly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1234.5s	1234.5	 consumer credit bubble. Here's a crazy statistic for you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1237.3s	1237.3	 In the 2008 financial crisis,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1239.9s	1239.9	 the median home price to median income in the United States was five X.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1244.6s	1244.6	 Today, it's seven X.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1246.7s	1246.7	 So people today own homes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1249.8s	1249.8	 that are significantly more expensive relative to their income and earnings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1254.1s	1254.1	 than was the case during the financial crisis that caused a massive housing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1257.1s	1257.1	 bubble. You're missing a bunch of important data points here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1259.5s	1259.5	 The most important thing that happened was we changed the way that we are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1262.3s	1262.3	 allowed to capitalize mortgages and the borrow rates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1265.6s	1265.6	 So that fundamentally is what drove that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1268.0s	1268.0	 OK, so, for example, you were not allowed, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1270.8s	1270.8	 to have a qualifying mortgage be over a million dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1273.5s	1273.5	 At the end of last year, we changed those rules.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1275.8s	1275.8	 So if you X out those effects that allow the FDIC and all of these,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1279.9s	1279.9	 you know, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and all of this financial gobbledygook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1283.6s	1283.6	 acronym infrastructure that props up the U.S. economy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1287.3s	1287.3	 if you factor in those rules, I don't think it's as extreme as you're describing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1290.9s	1290.9	 What do you mean consumers have more debt relative to the value of their home?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1295.3s	1295.3	 Sorry, debt relative to their income than they did during the 2008
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1298.3s	1298.3	 financial crisis. That's a fact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1300.2s	1300.2	 Has nothing to do with the structural way the market works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1302.4s	1302.4	 But like I'm saying is the market allows you to be that levered
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1305.5s	1305.5	 without actually getting foreclosed on or, you know, you're allowed to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1308.6s	1308.6	 the borrow rates that allow you to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1310.1s	1310.1	 All I'm saying is it's not like excess credit is being built up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1314.4s	1314.4	 in the system abnormally by consumers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1316.9s	1316.9	 It's just that these products, again, are being structured
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1319.9s	1319.9	 in a way that that gets people down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1321.8s	1321.8	 And real estate is a very unique category because you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1324.7s	1324.7	 I buyers taking stuff off the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1326.6s	1326.6	 You have regulation not letting people build more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1328.6s	1328.6	 So I would be very reticent to extrapolate what's happening in real estate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1333.0s	1333.0	 Yeah, I don't think we have like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1335.9s	1335.9	 an issue in real estate, to be completely honest with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1338.0s	1338.0	 I think that we may have a looming credit crisis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1343.0s	1343.0	 But the practical issue today is I think asset wealth destruction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1346.0s	1346.0	 in the financial markets, whenever that happens, generally tends to lead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1349.8s	1349.8	 to what SAC said, which is belt tightening by companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1353.5s	1353.5	 Focus on maximizing short term free cash flow,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1356.8s	1356.8	 which unfortunately, the way to cut that is by cutting OPEX.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1360.8s	1360.8	 And the way that you cut OPEX is by unfortunately spending less
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1365.0s	1365.0	 on goods and services, which affects other companies and firing employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1369.6s	1369.6	 And I think what you're going to start to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1371.9s	1371.9	 are a bunch of those things where these companies make these short term
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1375.8s	1375.8	 optimizations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1377.0s	1377.0	 Then how that unfortunately impacts the consumer is what Friedberg said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1381.4s	1381.4	 which is that if the consumer was already living, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1384.6s	1384.6	 sort of at the knife's edge and using a lot of credit to basically allow them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1389.1s	1389.1	 to live a lifestyle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1391.7s	1391.7	 That wasn't sustainable, whether that meant not having a job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1395.2s	1395.2	 or whether that meant, you know, vacationing and staying in Airbnbs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1399.3s	1399.3	 All of that will come to an end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1400.6s	1400.6	 Now, you can say, what is the canary in the coal mine?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1403.9s	1403.9	 And let me just give you one thing that hit the wire this morning,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1408.8s	1408.8	 which will show you how bad the credit market is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1412.8s	1412.8	 So there was a article in Bloomberg that came out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1416.7s	1416.7	 that said instead of Elon taking margin loans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1420.6s	1420.6	 to fund his acquisition of Twitter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1423.3s	1423.3	 there is an idea being floated by Morgan Stanley to use convertible debt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1428.5s	1428.5	 Now, I love this idea because I think it's an excellent mechanism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1432.4s	1432.4	 This was the, you know, when Elon had convertible debt on Tesla,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1436.6s	1436.6	 that was, you know, one big escape velocity moment for me in my career in 2016.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1442.8s	1442.8	 So I believe in these products.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1444.2s	1444.2	 I believe that they work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1446.0s	1446.0	 But the reason I'm bringing this up is that the what it said is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1449.5s	1449.5	 I'll just read this to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1450.2s	1450.2	 The preferred equity may have a 20 year maturity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1453.5s	1453.5	 and include a feature allowing interest to be paid in kind at a rate of 14 percent a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1458.5s	1458.5	 If the single greatest investors cost of capital for debt in today's market is 14 percent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1465.1s	1465.1	 I think you have to really start to question what the credit markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1468.4s	1468.4	 really look like for market clearing prices,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1470.7s	1470.7	 because if that's the price for a risk bearing asset
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1473.7s	1473.7	 run by the greatest entrepreneur of our generation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1477.0s	1477.0	 there's a bunch of stuff, Freeburg, to your point, that's pretty mispriced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1481.0s	1481.0	 I think one thing that's a silver lining here is we did build up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1485.8s	1485.8	 11 million job openings, labor participation is really low right now, even post pandemic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1493.0s	1493.0	 People, if you ask this question, I think Chamath,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1495.4s	1495.4	 of like, how are people going to get out of, to Freeburg's point, the lifestyle issue?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1499.4s	1499.4	 Like they want to live a lifestyle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1500.2s	1500.2	 It's a pretty easy solution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1502.6s	1502.6	 Go back to work, get a second job, start working again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1506.0s	1506.0	 We peaked, you know, in the 90s with something around 67 percent labor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1512.7s	1512.7	 forced participation, and then we're now, you know, just right around 62.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1517.4s	1517.4	 This is a large number of people who could go back to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1521.2s	1521.2	 Now, you mentioned that slight tick up, ever so slight in unemployment claims.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1526.4s	1526.4	 We'll see if that goes up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1528.6s	1528.6	 But I think the potential way out here is that it's bottom, meaning like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1533.2s	1533.2	 if you look now, the last three or four unemployment claims,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1537.2s	1537.2	 readings in a row have largely showed that it's floored.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1540.2s	1540.2	 And it looks like in the last couple of readings that it's starting to take up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1543.5s	1543.5	 Well, with three percent unemployment, we're kind of on a floor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1545.8s	1545.8	 You can't possibly have less unemployment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1549.6s	1549.6	 Unemployment is going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1550.8s	1550.8	 I think employment has peaked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1553.0s	1553.0	 Unemployment is going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1554.1s	1554.1	 And it's exactly what you said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1555.4s	1555.4	 Look, all of us in our board meetings the last several months, really,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1557.6s	1557.6	 have been warning founders that the environment is changing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1560.5s	1560.5	 Don't assume that we're always going to have a boom and the cash is always going to be there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1564.2s	1564.2	 However, nobody's taking the advice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1566.5s	1566.5	 Well, because there's been resistance because people don't want to believe it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1570.0s	1570.0	 And then in addition, it's always like, well, how do you know it's not going to bounce back?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1573.1s	1573.1	 Right. And now I think after what's happened, really, since April and really in the last week or two,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1581.1s	1581.1	 I think no one's really saying that anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1582.8s	1582.8	 Everyone understands that we're in a new environment and they just don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1585.6s	1585.6	 They either have experience with how bad it's going to be or they don't,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1590.4s	1590.4	 but everyone understands things have changed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1592.3s	1592.3	 So every company that's acting sensibly is freezing their hiring, putting a break on the growth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1600.6s	1600.6	 slowing down their plans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1601.8s	1601.8	 And that will absolutely translate into less job creation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1606.7s	1606.7	 Yeah, we've really pushed that exact plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1611.6s	1611.6	 I used to sit down with our founders and in these board meetings, what we would talk about is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1616.7s	1616.7	 the base case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1618.1s	1618.1	 And then we would always talk about a blue sky case and a really bold case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1622.1s	1622.1	 Right. So three flavors of kind of like kind of go and do what you're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1627.6s	1627.6	 Actually put a little bit more gas on it and, you know, press the gas and then really go for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1632.5s	1632.5	 I've stopped all of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1634.0s	1634.0	 You know, these last five months have been me and my founders basically saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1637.6s	1637.6	 okay, guys, what's the extreme bear case?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1640.8s	1640.8	 What's the bear case?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1642.8s	1642.8	 And then what's the base case?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1644.5s	1644.5	 What's normal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1645.8s	1645.8	 And what we are trying to figure out is how do we make sure that we can optimize for a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1655.2s	1655.2	 And when that's not possible, how do we minimize burn so that we can extend our runway as long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1659.9s	1659.9	 as possible and show technical validation so that we can raise money on reasonable terms,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1664.4s	1664.4	 not even great terms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1666.0s	1666.0	 And if the boards of these private companies haven't been doing that for the last five or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1670.0s	1670.0	 six months and the burn hasn't dramatically changed, I think that they are, they've been a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1676.6s	1676.6	 little derelict in their duty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1679.1s	1679.1	 You're not doing a very good job as a board member or investor if you haven't forced these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1682.9s	1682.9	 conversations with your CEO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1684.5s	1684.5	 And you shouldn't expect the CEO to bring this to you in many ways, because it's very hard for them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1690.2s	1690.2	 with the focus that they have every day to put this front of mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1693.4s	1693.4	 But as Zach said, you have to do it as a director.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1697.1s	1697.1	 If you're worth the salt at all, you have to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1700.9s	1700.9	 But it's been quite the opposite we saw with fast.com Co was the opposite, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1704.7s	1704.7	 People were just not even considering it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1707.0s	1707.0	 It's just survival risk is on the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1709.6s	1709.6	 You really have to act differently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1711.0s	1711.0	 It's kind of like the difference between a poker tournament and a cash game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1715.6s	1715.6	 You know, like players behave very differently in a poker tournament.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1718.5s	1718.5	 The players are much more conservative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1720.0s	1720.0	 Why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1720.6s	1720.6	 Because once you're out, you're out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1721.9s	1721.9	 So if you lose the wrong hand, you're busted out of the tournament.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1724.4s	1724.4	 Whereas in a cash game, you can just rebuy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1726.4s	1726.4	 Well, we've gone from basically being in a cash game where people can just rebuy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1729.9s	1729.9	 Maybe they won't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1730.8s	1730.8	 You know, they could go out and raise more money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1732.2s	1732.2	 Maybe it's not the valuation they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1733.5s	1733.5	 Maybe it's not as much they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1734.6s	1734.6	 But, you know, in a boom, you can always go raise more money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1737.6s	1737.6	 Now, if there's no more money available to keep funding your plan, if it's not working,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1742.4s	1742.4	 you really have to think about survival and you have to be more conservative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1746.3s	1746.3	 You can't let yourself bust out of the tournament.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1748.4s	1748.4	 By the way, I'll say two things on that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1751.0s	1751.0	 What you're describing is exactly the condition that is now led to the fact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1755.6s	1755.6	 that roughly one third of public biotech stocks are trading below cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1759.8s	1759.8	 So their entity value, the biotech industry as a whole, SYNBio in particular,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1768.0s	1768.0	 but really biotech, about a third of companies now trade below their cash balance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1773.3s	1773.3	 I'll send you guys some links on this, Nick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1775.0s	1775.0	 I'll add it to the show notes afterwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1777.6s	1777.6	 And the reason is, yeah, 40% of them have less than 20 months of cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1786.0s	1786.0	 Um, 60% of them have less than two and a half years worth of cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1790.1s	1790.1	 And historically, biotech companies, they kind of run an R&D cycle to prove that their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1794.6s	1794.6	 biotech product will work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1796.2s	1796.2	 And if it works, there'll be a pharma company that'll swoop in and give them some money to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1799.4s	1799.4	 go through the next phase of clinical trials, or they'll do a secondary offering and raise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1802.8s	1802.8	 more money to get through the next phase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1804.5s	1804.5	 But because the capital markets are gone now for them, or the assumption is, hey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1808.7s	1808.7	 there's not going to be any capital left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1810.4s	1810.4	 They're still burning whatever it is, 20, 30, 40, 80, 100 million dollars a quarter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1814.8s	1814.8	 They've only got a few hundred million dollars in the bank.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1817.0s	1817.0	 And everyone's like, hey, look, the odds of you guys actually, even if your technology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1820.7s	1820.7	 works, even if your product works, the odds of you being able to get the funding to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1824.3s	1824.3	 through the next phase of clinical trials is much lower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1827.3s	1827.3	 Therefore, the ascribed value of your business is negative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1831.0s	1831.0	 And we're seeing that across the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1832.8s	1832.8	 I started working in Silicon Valley in 2001.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1835.2s	1835.2	 That's when I graduated from Cal, and I worked at an investment bank doing tech M&A.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1840.2s	1840.2	 And that was right after the dot com implosion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1842.8s	1842.8	 Most of what I worked on was public companies that were selling for less than cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1846.4s	1846.4	 Today, we don't talk about that over the last 20 years because it just never seems to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1850.1s	1850.1	 Well, it's a phenomenal thing to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1851.9s	1851.9	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1852.1s	1852.1	 I mean, you could basically what that means is you could shut the company down and make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1856.4s	1856.4	 a profit and still own the IP.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1858.0s	1858.0	 So that is what happened in the dot com area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1860.0s	1860.0	 Yes, we sold a bunch of companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1861.7s	1861.7	 I was on the banking side representing the sellers, the private, the public companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1866.3s	1866.3	 because there was no business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1867.8s	1867.8	 They were just burning money and there was no line of sight to making money or line of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1870.8s	1870.8	 sight to raising money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1872.0s	1872.0	 So the board said, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1873.6s	1873.6	 We just got to get this thing out, shut it down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1876.2s	1876.2	 And then, you know, hey, what's cheaper shutting it down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1878.5s	1878.5	 What's going to make us more money shutting it down and distributing the cash or letting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1881.5s	1881.5	 a private equity firm come in and shut it down for us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1883.8s	1883.8	 And in a lot of cases, they sold these public companies to private equity firms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1887.4s	1887.4	 Let's say the company's got 100 million in cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1889.0s	1889.0	 They sold it for 60 million private equity firm comes in and they're like, boom, boom,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1892.5s	1892.5	 boom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1892.7s	1892.7	 Everyone's fired.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1893.3s	1893.3	 This thing shut down and they liquidated it and they took made a 20 million dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1897.1s	1897.1	 spread on that thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1898.0s	1898.0	 I will say on the flip side for private markets, and I think this is a really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1901.7s	1901.7	 important maybe point for us to have a conversation about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1906.3s	1906.3	 Over the past decade, as you guys know, there have been more venture money raised than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1911.1s	1911.1	 any time in history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1912.4s	1912.4	 The numbers have been going up every year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1913.7s	1913.7	 The number of funds total capital raised.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1915.6s	1915.6	 But at the end of 2021, if you look at the total funds raised and the total capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1920.0s	1920.0	 deployed by venture funds, we have a 230 billion dollar capital dry powder hangover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1925.7s	1925.7	 So there's a quarter trillion dollars of cash sitting in venture coffers that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1930.7s	1930.7	 can call and write the checks into.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1932.7s	1932.7	 So I think it provides a really interesting contrast that sets us up for a dynamic over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1937.5s	1937.5	 the next few years on what's going to happen in private markets, because you're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1940.7s	1940.7	 have the haves and the have nots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1942.3s	1942.3	 The haves are going to have a lot of frigging money available to them because these venture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1946.0s	1946.0	 funds need to be deployed over the next few years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1948.2s	1948.2	 The have nots are the ones that don't have proof points to a viable outcome in their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1952.3s	1952.3	 business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1952.9s	1952.9	 But the haves are going to have a lot of capital available to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1956.5s	1956.5	 With one caveat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1960.9s	1960.9	 So what do you guys think will happen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1962.3s	1962.3	 There's two caveats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1963.3s	1963.3	 In the context of everyone saying, hey, there's no capital available, there's no capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1966.0s	1966.0	 available.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1966.2s	1966.2	 That's not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1966.8s	1966.8	 There's more capital than has ever been available.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1968.8s	1968.8	 So how does it get allocated?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1970.1s	1970.1	 So the first thing is, to Jamad's point, at what valuation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1974.8s	1974.8	 And so there's going to need to be discipline and they're going to write that money will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1979.0s	1979.0	 go to the winners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1979.9s	1979.9	 Other thing to remember is during the great financial crisis, for about a year, maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1985.3s	1985.3	 even two, many venture firms did not want to call capital from LPs whose portfolios
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1990.2s	1990.2	 were crushed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1990.6s	1990.6	 And LPs said, I know we're on the hook for this, but I would appreciate it if you don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=1994.7s	1994.7	 make a ton of investments right now because we don't want to clear our already demolished
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2000.1s	2000.1	 portfolios to then fund your venture funds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2003.1s	2003.1	 So those are commitments, it's not cash in the bank.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2006.1s	2006.1	 And those commitments only come from Harvard, Yale, CalPERS, Ford Foundation, whoever,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2011.7s	2011.7	 Morales, and Kettering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2013.2s	2013.2	 If the GPs can ask the LPs for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2016.0s	2016.0	 And the last time this happened, and I don't know if it will happen this time, but I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2019.0s	2019.0	 you remember it too, Jamad, the LPs specifically said, hey, pump the brakes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2024.1s	2024.1	 Yeah, let me build on what you say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2025.5s	2025.5	 In 2000, the more extreme measure happened with, which is that most of these venture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2030.2s	2030.2	 investors returned the money and just canceled and tore up the LPA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2034.1s	2034.1	 Now, why would they do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2035.7s	2035.7	 Why would you tear up commitments for a quarter trillion dollars?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2038.7s	2038.7	 It's because your portfolio is trash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2042.4s	2042.4	 Meaning, if you have made a bunch of horrible investments that you know are now totally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2047.0s	2047.0	 upside down, you have a responsibility to manage those investments to a reasonable outcome,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2052.4s	2052.4	 and ideally even try to get some salvage value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2055.5s	2055.5	 And so, you know, it's very hard for you to look at an LP in the eye and all of a sudden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2059.4s	2059.4	 say, you know what, I'm going to deploy this fresh capital, and I'm in a psychologically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2063.4s	2063.4	 good state of mind to do that well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2066.3s	2066.3	 And I think that what history shows is that when you have these drawdowns,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2070.9s	2070.9	 the money is made by new entrants or fresh capital, which doesn't have the legacy of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2075.8s	2075.8	 a bad portfolio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2077.2s	2077.2	 The returns are not captured by the same people, and the reason is because they have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2081.2s	2081.2	 the psychological baggage of a horrible portfolio or horrible marks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2086.1s	2086.1	 So, for example, there was a tweet, and I'll send this to you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2090.1s	2090.1	 This is from a guy named Matt Turk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2092.6s	2092.6	 He said, to put the depth of the reset in context, to justify a $1 billion valuation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2099.9s	2099.9	 $1 billion valuation, a cloud unicorn today would need to plan on doing $178 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2108.5s	2108.5	 in revenue in the next 12 months if you apply the current median cloud software multiple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2116.3s	2116.3	 of 5.6 times forward revenue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2118.4s	2118.4	 Now, let's put it in a different way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2119.6s	2119.6	 If you're a company that's worth $10 billion, that means that you have to come up with $1.78
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2127.3s	2127.3	 billion of annual recurring revenue for the market to give you a median multiple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2133.1s	2133.1	 How many SaaS companies in SaaS, you'll know this, how many SaaS companies even get close
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2138.0s	2138.0	 to $2 billion of ARR?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2140.8s	2140.8	 Probably a lot less than the number of SaaS companies that are worth $10 billion on paper.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2145.0s	2145.0	 So, by the way, we should also talk about who's the bag holder in that transaction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2149.7s	2149.7	 It's the employees, and we should explain why that is in a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2152.9s	2152.9	 But just to build on what Jason is saying and, Freebrook, what you're saying is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2157.2s	2157.2	 in moments like this, I would ignore all of the dry powder and all of that stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2163.1s	2163.1	 I think that there are a lot of venture investors today who've deployed way too quickly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2167.8s	2167.8	 and if they want to have any reputation over the next 10 years, we'll have to rehabilitate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2172.5s	2172.5	 their portfolio and try to return money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2174.7s	2174.7	 Let me just say one thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2175.6s	2175.6	 I saw an analysis from one of the biggest venture firms in the valley over a 14-fund cycle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2182.8s	2182.8	 So they looked at data from 14 funds, and they showed that 40% of their capital was deployed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2189.6s	2189.6	 in businesses that they were chasing valuation, meaning the business wasn't performing well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2194.5s	2194.5	 and they needed to bridge the company or support it through a down round or some other sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2199.6s	2199.6	 situation where at the time it was, let's support our portfolio, 40% of their capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2204.8s	2204.8	 On that 40%, they made 50% losses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2208.5s	2208.5	 So they deployed money in a situation that was not an accelerating, successful,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2213.8s	2213.8	 up round kind of business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2215.2s	2215.2	 It was a declining business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2216.9s	2216.9	 And in that support, they lost half their money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2219.1s	2219.1	 The other 60%, they make 3X.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2221.6s	2221.6	 So it averages out that they make whatever it is, 2, 2.5X on the whole portfolio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2227.2s	2227.2	 But I think it really speaks to the condition that a lot of venture firms may make the mistake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2232.0s	2232.0	 around doing over the next couple of years, which is I've got all of these businesses that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2236.8s	2236.8	 are suffering through down rounds or need supportive capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2239.4s	2239.4	 And I know it can get there, but that belief ultimately costs the LPs and costs the fund more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2244.4s	2244.4	 And it's why we saw such negative return cycles happen after the dot com crash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2248.5s	2248.5	 How about this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2249.6s	2249.6	 Since 1994, okay, just guess how many funds, private equity growth venture funds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2258.4s	2258.4	 even existed that are greater than a billion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2262.0s	2262.0	 So this is over 30 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2265.6s	2265.6	 How many funds do you think even existed over a billion dollars since 1994 to today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2270.2s	2270.2	 How many funds?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2271.2s	2271.2	 Like how many funds have been raised that are individual funds or the brand names?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2275.1s	2275.1	 Yeah, since 1994, how many do you think there are?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2278.2s	2278.2	 50.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2279.5s	2279.5	 1,276.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2282.1s	2282.1	 Oh, you're including private equity and stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2283.6s	2283.6	 Oh, I always got those venturing out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2284.8s	2284.8	 Okay, sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2285.4s	2285.4	 Okay. So now of those 1,276 private equity funds or growth funds or crossover funds or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2292.8s	2292.8	 got it or funds, how many do you think have actually managed to return more than 2.3X the money?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2299.9s	2299.9	 2.3X.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2301.4s	2301.4	 10%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2302.1s	2302.1	 10%, 5%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2303.6s	2303.6	 10%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2304.4s	2304.4	 22 of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2305.3s	2305.3	 It's like under 2%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2306.4s	2306.4	 Under 2%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2307.2s	2307.2	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2308.0s	2308.0	 So here's the point that I'm trying to make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2310.4s	2310.4	 Investing is very hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2313.4s	2313.4	 Everybody looks like a genius.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2315.5s	2315.5	 All of these funds come up with all of their nonsensical ways of showing IRRs and all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2321.3s	2321.3	 these fake gymnastics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2323.4s	2323.4	 But the truth is in the data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2325.0s	2325.0	 And what the data says is that in the last 30 years, the minute you get over your ski
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2329.3s	2329.3	 tips at a billion dollars, very few people know what they're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2333.2s	2333.2	 Very few.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2334.0s	2334.0	 It's hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2334.9s	2334.9	 It's hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2336.0s	2336.0	 Multiples compress as you get to bigger deals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2338.6s	2338.6	 And you can't say where the value is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2340.7s	2340.7	 You can't deny this numerical truth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2343.6s	2343.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2343.9s	2343.9	 So again, I go back to, you know, the person that's always been talking about this and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2350.0s	2350.0	 who again may be proven right yet again is Bill Gurley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2352.9s	2352.9	 You know, everybody would make fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2354.7s	2354.7	 Why is Benchmark only raising $450 million?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2357.6s	2357.6	 Why would they only raise $500 million?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2360.3s	2360.3	 And they always were consistent because over the last 30 or 40 years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2364.7s	2364.7	 over multiple cycles, we have seen that this is the best way to optimize both for return
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2370.4s	2370.4	 and for mental clarity and for making our LPs happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2374.5s	2374.5	 Every variable was optimized at around 550.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2377.2s	2377.2	 Focus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2377.7s	2377.7	 And then you see 5 billion, 6 billion, 10 billion dollar funds funding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2382.1s	2382.1	 Makes sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2382.7s	2382.7	 5 billion, 6 billion, 10 billion, 20 billion dollar private companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2387.0s	2387.0	 And I think what we have to do is put two and two together and realize that it's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2391.2s	2391.2	 to be very difficult sledding from here for a lot of folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2394.4s	2394.4	 And when the venture or crossover investor has this mental baggage that they're dealing with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2401.5s	2401.5	 they're not going to be able to provide fundamentally sound advice to the CEO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2405.2s	2405.2	 They're going to optimize for making that portfolio turn to getting the bleeding in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2408.4s	2408.4	 the portfolio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2409.9s	2409.9	 The CEOs will make a bunch of suboptimal decisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2412.8s	2412.8	 It'll probably lead to a bunch of layoffs, bad technology decisions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2416.5s	2416.5	 things slow down and the cycle is reflexive in that sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2419.4s	2419.4	 And so, you know, we're going to go through a few years of sorting this out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2422.8s	2422.8	 Down rounds, liquidation preferences, nonsense, sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2426.0s	2426.0	 It will be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2426.6s	2426.6	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2426.9s	2426.9	 So, look, I agree with that point that these mega funds are very hard to repay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2431.4s	2431.4	 because they require you to have multiple winners, not just winners, but mega winners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2435.2s	2435.2	 So, you know, we've always kept our funds in that five to six hundred million dollar range
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2439.2s	2439.2	 where you really only need one winner per fund to basically return the fund.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2443.1s	2443.1	 But let me go back to this point about dry powder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2445.9s	2445.9	 Explain the math of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2446.6s	2446.6	 You typically own 15, 20 percent of a winner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2448.6s	2448.6	 So just walk us through the math.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2449.9s	2449.9	 Yeah, I mean, it might even last by the time that it reaches an exit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2453.2s	2453.2	 Right. Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2454.0s	2454.0	 So, you know, if you own 10 percent of one deck of corn, that's a billion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2459.7s	2459.7	 And if it's a five million dollar fund, you've doubled your fund.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2463.2s	2463.2	 But if it's a one or two billion dollar fund, you haven't even paid back the fund yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2467.5s	2467.5	 So that's I mean, this is how hard is it to hit a deck of corn?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2471.6s	2471.6	 Hard. It's hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2472.7s	2472.7	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2473.2s	2473.2	 Hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2473.6s	2473.6	 Real hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2474.0s	2474.0	 It really, really hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2475.4s	2475.4	 Real hard to hit to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2477.4s	2477.4	 I've had two in a decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2478.9s	2478.9	 Yeah, I've had two in the exact same time period.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2480.9s	2480.9	 Let me go back to this point about dry powder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2482.4s	2482.4	 I think it's actually important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2483.6s	2483.6	 So this would be a little bit more of a bright spot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2487.2s	2487.2	 So in a weird way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2489.0s	2489.0	 So there's a, I think, stunning article in TechCrunch just two days ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2494.1s	2494.1	 that said that Tiger Global, you know, which the hedge fund,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2497.1s	2497.1	 as of the end of April, the hedge fund had lost about 45 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2500.9s	2500.9	 And then May, the first weeks of May have been even worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2503.1s	2503.1	 So who knows what they're at now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2504.8s	2504.8	 But they had a separate venture vehicle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2507.6s	2507.6	 And their history of their venture vehicles is that they raised
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2512.8s	2512.8	 3.75 for a fund in 2020, then 6.65 billion in 2021.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2519.6s	2519.6	 And then just this year, they closed a 12.7 billion dollar fund in March.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2524.2s	2524.2	 Now, I think that fund was raised as early as September last year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2528.4s	2528.4	 but maybe there was some money that still trickled in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2530.8s	2530.8	 and they finally closed it in March.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2532.7s	2532.7	 But basically, what this article said is that this 12.7 billion dollar fund
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2537.8s	2537.8	 that they just raised is already nearly depleted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2540.8s	2540.8	 It's something like two thirds of the fund has already been deployed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2544.9s	2544.9	 So this idea that they've got like a lot of dry powder sitting on the sidelines,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2548.1s	2548.1	 I don't think they do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2549.4s	2549.4	 And then meanwhile, you know, the other big crossover funds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2552.4s	2552.4	 D1, CO2, they are completely risk off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2555.4s	2555.4	 I don't think they were ever as aggressive as Tiger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2557.9s	2557.9	 So they're not in as bad shape as Tiger,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2560.4s	2560.4	 but they're just basically sitting on the sidelines until this thing sorts itself out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2564.3s	2564.3	 So basically, all of this capital that flooded the venture markets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2568.0s	2568.0	 this growth capital that came in over the last couple of years, it's gone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2571.8s	2571.8	 I mean, that's basically dried up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2572.8s	2572.8	 Why did they go so fast, Zach?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2574.1s	2574.1	 What was their thinking?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2575.7s	2575.7	 Because you and I met with these folks, we saw them marking up our companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2579.2s	2579.2	 because you and I, you typically do a series A, that's your sweet spot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2582.0s	2582.0	 I typically do C into series A, you do A into B.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2584.6s	2584.6	 They were coming in and marking up our, in the B and C rounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2587.2s	2587.2	 What was their thinking?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2588.6s	2588.6	 What was their mistake here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2590.6s	2590.6	 I think the thinking was that we can create an index fund for pre-IPO tech companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2596.3s	2596.3	 for sort of late stage private tech companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2599.7s	2599.7	 The only problem was, and by the way, they did, if you could,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2603.2s	2603.2	 I think they did a good job sort of productizing that solution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2605.7s	2605.7	 I mean, if you send them your numbers in a certain format and do a meeting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2609.2s	2609.2	 they were like a term sheet generator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2610.7s	2610.7	 I mean, they speak out to machine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2611.9s	2611.9	 Wasn't that your original idea, Tramop?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2613.4s	2613.4	 You had, you had funding as a surface at one point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2616.9s	2616.9	 I did this thing called capital as a service where you would send us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2620.0s	2620.0	 you would send us, but you would send us your data or we would plug in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2624.0s	2624.0	 to whatever you use, say it was Stripe or Shopify.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2626.4s	2626.4	 We would suck out the data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2627.4s	2627.4	 We would run it against a bunch of models.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2629.6s	2629.6	 We would do a few simple regressions and then we would just index you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2632.9s	2632.9	 and then send you a term sheet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2633.9s	2633.9	 So we did do that all around the world, but we did it on very small dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2637.6s	2637.6	 You know, we did it at $500,000 checks, 250K checks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2640.8s	2640.8	 It was called capital as a service.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2642.4s	2642.4	 It's still a phenomenally good idea, but you would want to cure that business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2646.9s	2646.9	 for probably 10 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2649.0s	2649.0	 I would want it to do that on 10 years on my own money, you know, 10, 15, 20,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2652.8s	2652.8	 30, 50 million bucks before I would even dare raise LP money around that idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2656.4s	2656.4	 Because it's, I mean, at that point, it's the machines doing the work and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2660.1s	2660.1	 have to really be sure your models are right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2661.7s	2661.7	 Yes. The question sort of what was wrong with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2664.5s	2664.5	 I think that the thing that was wrong with it actually was just that the public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2668.8s	2668.8	 comps were all wrong, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2670.0s	2670.0	 So they were modeling to the public valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2674.0s	2674.0	 These are wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2675.4s	2675.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2676.1s	2676.1	 Well, no, it's look, they're hedge fund guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2677.9s	2677.9	 So they're looking at the public valuations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2680.7s	2680.7	 They're looking at the last private rounds and they see a spread, a large spread.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2685.0s	2685.0	 And they're like, we can arb this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2686.8s	2686.8	 So they go in with a massive amount of money, create a term sheet generator,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2689.7s	2689.7	 and they arb the spread.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2691.2s	2691.2	 The problem is that all the public valuations we now know were inflated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2695.2s	2695.2	 I actually think they did a reasonably good job in creating a great approach for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2700.8s	2700.8	 founders who want late stage capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2703.1s	2703.1	 If the valuations have been correct, I think it would have worked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2705.7s	2705.7	 Here's the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2707.2s	2707.2	 Right now, Peloton and Coinbase are both, their market caps are trading at lower
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2712.4s	2712.4	 than their last private market valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2715.3s	2715.3	 So let that sink in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2716.8s	2716.8	 Like if you did that last private round, you're underwater big time in those names.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2721.6s	2721.6	 Or I don't know if Coinbase popped today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2723.0s	2723.0	 They were taking their signals from the public markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2725.0s	2725.0	 This is the problem with the Fed and the administration and Congress basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2730.4s	2730.4	 flooding the zone with all this fake money is that it distorts all the signals in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2734.4s	2734.4	 economies and then people start making investment decisions that don't work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2739.0s	2739.0	 And then you have this massive correction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2740.7s	2740.7	 How long have we been doing this, Jamath?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2742.3s	2742.3	 How long have we been overfeeding the market?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2745.0s	2745.0	 It obviously happened under Biden and Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2748.1s	2748.1	 Did it go back to Obama or no?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2750.7s	2750.7	 Yeah, it started in 2008, nine with trouble asset relief program,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2756.4s	2756.4	 which is basically a fund, you know, to create market liquidity, essentially.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2762.4s	2762.4	 But what it also did on the heels of the great financial crisis was we introduced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2771.1s	2771.1	 comfort around this idea of quantitative easing or, you know, having what's called the Fed put.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2776.2s	2776.2	 You may hear that a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2777.2s	2777.2	 What does that mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2777.9s	2777.9	 Which is that when market conditions get too, you know, stiff or rigid or inflexible,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2786.4s	2786.4	 the Fed will generally step in with liquidity, typically into the credit market,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2790.6s	2790.6	 never into the equity market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2792.1s	2792.1	 But what that does is that also still flows into the equity market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2795.2s	2795.2	 So everybody behaves like there's a downside price at which the Fed is guaranteed to act.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2800.3s	2800.3	 And that really started to be a bailout that really started to be in people's psychology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2804.8s	2804.8	 after the great financial crisis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2806.4s	2806.4	 And then through the 2010s, we had several instances where we had that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2811.9s	2811.9	 where we had moments of sort of like market volatility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2814.7s	2814.7	 And all along the way, what we also had were academics that started to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2819.8s	2819.8	 you know, promote things like modern monetary theory, this idea that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2823.2s	2823.2	 you know, money printing was a good idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2825.6s	2825.6	 And so we had this, again, very reflexive loop where, you know, anointed experts,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2830.8s	2830.8	 you know, you know, did talk pieces and thought pieces and books,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2834.9s	2834.9	 and then pseudo intellectuals would parrot this stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2837.3s	2837.3	 And then, you know, the government infrastructure would behave like this was a reasonable thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2841.9s	2841.9	 to do. And it built on itself for a decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2843.9s	2843.9	 So we've been doing this for 13 or 14 years now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2846.8s	2846.8	 And now we're trying to undo it and put the genie back in the bottle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2849.6s	2849.6	 And it's proving much, much harder than we thought,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2851.6s	2851.6	 because people have unfortunately got addicted to the crack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2854.0s	2854.0	 They're addicted to the drug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2855.1s	2855.1	 They you're trying to take the oxy away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2857.8s	2857.8	 And that's a and people are going to go through with really, really bad withdrawal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2864.9s	2864.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2865.7s	2865.7	 If you have a quarter trillion dollars of dry powder, let's assume no one gives their money back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2869.9s	2869.9	 and they don't do stupid stuff like chase losing companies in their portfolio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2874.1s	2874.1	 And they allocated in a smart way to winning companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2877.1s	2877.1	 Does that not mean that we end up seeing a significantly kind of outsized amount of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2882.4s	2882.4	 capital going to a few highly successful businesses that will end up seeing this kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2888.2s	2888.2	 of supercharging of a small set of businesses as opposed to this rise of the unicorn,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2892.8s	2892.8	 which is what we saw over the past call it, you know, eight, seven, eight years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2898.0s	2898.0	 And that you have this big bifurcation in the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2900.8s	2900.8	 The VC market starts to kind of say, hey, you're not making money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2903.9s	2903.9	 You don't have a line of sight to making money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2905.6s	2905.6	 You're off the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2906.8s	2906.8	 But the top decile get overfunded and they become kind of the next the next mega caps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2913.5s	2913.5	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2913.8s	2913.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2914.3s	2914.3	 I mean, it does not happen in this moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2917.6s	2917.6	 Well, so look, if we look ahead two or three years, I had a.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2920.8s	2920.8	 Can I just tell you why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2921.6s	2921.6	 Let's take let's take the perfect company, which is Stripe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2924.4s	2924.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2924.9s	2924.9	 So now 50 billion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2927.2s	2927.2	 Well, they've been funded to a mega cap, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2929.6s	2929.6	 50 billion dollars of horrible VCs who have made horrible decisions here to for knocking on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2935.6s	2935.6	 callous and store saying, can you please take my 50 billion dollars?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2938.9s	2938.9	 Because I'm trying to be money good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2941.6s	2941.6	 Why do the callous and want to take on this headache?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2944.1s	2944.1	 Why do they want to flutter, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2946.8s	2946.8	 mess set their cap table up with all these folks and then at what price?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2951.6s	2951.6	 So if you're sitting at the board of any really good, well run company,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2955.4s	2955.4	 of course, you'll take some bite size, you know, amounts of very decisive capital in these moments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2960.2s	2960.2	 If you think you can market consolidate or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2963.0s	2963.0	 But I think the point that all of these companies are going through is largely the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2966.8s	2966.8	 If if the best companies aren't doing what we just talked about, I would be shocked as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2971.9s	2971.9	 The best companies are thinking let's batten down the hatches and let's not distract ourselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2976.8s	2976.8	 And so I'm not sure this is the moment where a really horrible VC who's at a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2982.2s	2982.2	 terrible track record who've just blundered through five billion dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2986.5s	2986.5	 is going to be able to put in a billion dollars to strike.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2990.2s	2990.2	 What do you think, Sachs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2991.2s	2991.2	 Let me speak to kind of the environment that I think is going to happen over the next few years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2994.7s	2994.7	 and then what founders will succeed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=2997.0s	2997.0	 I think you're right, Freeberg, that the VCs are going to become much more discriminating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3001.6s	3001.6	 and there's going to be a much more polarized outcome here for companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3006.5s	3006.5	 I had a tweet storm that Elon actually gave a nice boost to by saying he agreed with it where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3011.6s	3011.6	 I basically said, look, starts with high growth and moderate burn will get funded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3015.2s	3015.2	 through this downturn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3016.6s	3016.6	 Starts with moderate growth and high burn will not get funded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3020.1s	3020.1	 So what's going to happen is that the sort of mediocre ones are going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3025.2s	3025.2	 we're going to get to a very polarized outcome very quickly where, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3028.7s	3028.7	 I think a lot of founders think that if their numbers are just okay and not great,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3032.5s	3032.5	 then they'll be able to raise but at a lower valuation or they'll be able to raise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3036.3s	3036.3	 something but maybe not as much as they wanted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3038.0s	3038.0	 What will happen is the middle cases kind of go away in an environment like this and everyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3043.0s	3043.0	 just wants to fund the best companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3045.2s	3045.2	 So certain things will become absolutely fatal for startups in this environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3050.4s	3050.4	 One is obviously if they're just not growing, they're not going to be able to raise and good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3053.7s	3053.7	 growth really starts in the early stages in terms of doubling year over year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3057.6s	3057.6	 Second, negative or low gross margins are absolutely fatal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3061.2s	3061.2	 Nobody wants to fund businesses that may not even be real businesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3065.0s	3065.0	 And I would say acceptable gross margins really start at 50%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3069.3s	3069.3	 Third, payback.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3071.4s	3071.4	 People want to know that you can pay back your customer acquisition costs in a year or less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3076.0s	3076.0	 And then like I mentioned, the burn, you know, a burn multiple of one is really ideal where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3082.0s	3082.0	 you're burning not more than your net new ARR but certainly not more than two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3087.6s	3087.6	 I think burn multiples over two where you're spending, you're burning $2 to add $1 of growth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3094.2s	3094.2	 That's where I think companies start becoming unfundable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3097.1s	3097.1	 So I think founders are going to have to pay a lot more attention to these disqualifiers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3104.3s	3104.3	 But I think that for companies who meet the criteria, who have good growth, low burn,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3111.9s	3111.9	 good business fundamentals, they will be able to raise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3114.0s	3114.0	 And look, here's what's going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3116.0s	3116.0	 The crossover investors are washed out of the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3118.9s	3118.9	 They're gone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3119.7s	3119.7	 I mean, Tiger's already deployed all of its capital and I don't know when they're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3122.7s	3122.7	 to be back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3123.3s	3123.3	 So the so-called tourist money, basically the big investors who weren't in the system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3128.6s	3128.6	 a few years ago, they're basically going to leave the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3131.5s	3131.5	 However, there will be the big traditional venture funds will have large funds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3135.2s	3135.2	 but they're going to deploy them much more slowly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3136.9s	3136.9	 These one-year pace of deployments, they're going to stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3141.1s	3141.1	 They'll be back to three.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3142.0s	3142.0	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3142.4s	3142.4	 So just think about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3143.2s	3143.2	 Even if you had the same amount of money being raised and deployed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3147.6s	3147.6	 but it was happening over three years instead of one, that would be a two-thirds reduction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3151.5s	3151.5	 in the availability of capital in the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3153.5s	3153.5	 So who's that going to go to?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3155.6s	3155.6	 You're not putting that in-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3156.3s	3156.3	 It's going to go to the best companies that I'm talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3158.4s	3158.4	 You're not going to go to somebody who's going to blow through it in nine months,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3161.4s	3161.4	 who's playing every hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3163.2s	3163.2	 You cannot play that way anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3164.6s	3164.6	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3165.1s	3165.1	 So what we're telling our founders is, number one, you got to lengthen your runway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3168.8s	3168.8	 The days of raising a new round every 12 months are over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3171.2s	3171.2	 You got to plan on not raising for two to three years if you can help it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3176.0s	3176.0	 And then you really have to sharpen your pencil and work on these business fundamentals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3180.1s	3180.1	 One thing you need to do is you need to have a realistic conversation about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3184.6s	3184.6	 am I really able to raise another round in this environment with the metrics I currently have?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3188.5s	3188.5	 And if the answer is no, you need to cut your burn to give yourself the time to fix the business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3194.9s	3194.9	 Fixing a business normally takes two to three years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3197.6s	3197.6	 So if you got less than two years or even two and a half years of burn,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3201.4s	3201.4	 and you have one of those disqualifiers I talked about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3204.1s	3204.1	 you better cut your burn quickly to give yourself the time to fix those disqualifiers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3209.0s	3209.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3209.6s	3209.6	 I mean, I wish people, we've been talking about this for a year, folks, and some founders just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3214.2s	3214.2	 are not accepting the reality of the situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3217.6s	3217.6	 And if you look at what happened, we have a generation that's never experienced a down market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3223.0s	3223.0	 And these down markets happen so violently that they think people are panicking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3229.0s	3229.0	 Somebody made a joke, like Bill Gurley's called five of the last three recessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3233.6s	3233.6	 And it's like, well, I mean, we have scar tissue and it's that the velocity of the downturn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3240.1s	3240.1	 All those kids dunking on Gurley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3241.7s	3241.7	 Well, guess who's going to have the last laugh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3243.3s	3243.3	 I think precisely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3244.0s	3244.0	 I texted Gurley last night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3246.1s	3246.1	 He's had the last laugh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3247.0s	3247.0	 I literally DM'd him last night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3248.6s	3248.6	 I said, listen, the water's great right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3250.7s	3250.7	 I am doing deals back at six to $12 million in the seed space with 200k in revenue and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3257.8s	3257.8	 real founders and discipline.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3260.0s	3260.0	 Start investing again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3261.1s	3261.1	 It's great now because the deals are now taking, I don't know if you're Hicks Springs in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3265.6s	3265.6	 SACs, but the deals went from taking two, three days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3269.3s	3269.3	 Now they're back up to four to six weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3271.6s	3271.6	 And we're having very thoughtful discussions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3273.4s	3273.4	 We're meeting a third time with founders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3275.2s	3275.2	 We're talking about their go-to market strategy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3277.5s	3277.5	 We're getting to talk to three or four customers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3279.7s	3279.7	 I had founders who said, you can't be in this deal if you want to talk to my customers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3284.1s	3284.1	 And that wasn't one founder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3285.6s	3285.6	 Multiple founders said, if you want to talk to our customers, then you don't get an allocation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3290.4s	3290.4	 And I said, okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3291.5s	3291.5	 The thing to keep in mind, I won't do the deal, but that was how dysfunctional this was, Chema.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3296.8s	3296.8	 The thing to keep in mind is that all these late stage companies are mispriced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3300.0s	3300.0	 Doesn't matter whether you're the bottom decile or the top decile.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3303.3s	3303.3	 You are massively mispriced and there needs to be some correction between 30 and 70% on valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3311.0s	3311.0	 How do you solve it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3311.7s	3311.7	 I have a point of view on that actually, because so look, there's a major difference, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3316.8s	3316.8	 between a valuation multiple collapse in the public markets versus the private market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3322.4s	3322.4	 It's gone down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3323.0s	3323.0	 Look, the SaaS valuation multiples have gone down 70%, 80%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3326.1s	3326.1	 There's no disputing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3327.3s	3327.3	 What are they?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3329.0s	3329.0	 Look, it used to be that the public markets were trading at 15 times ARR for the median
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3335.5s	3335.5	 SaaS company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3336.0s	3336.0	 Now it's 5.6%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3337.5s	3337.5	 So yeah, we're talking about two thirds, 70%, 80% reductions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3342.3s	3342.3	 If it happened in the public stocks, it deserves to happen in the private stocks too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3345.8s	3345.8	 Jamal's absolutely right about that and a lot of people aren't recognizing that fact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3348.8s	3348.8	 However, here's the difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3350.7s	3350.7	 The median SaaS company is growing maybe 15 to 20%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3354.2s	3354.2	 When you've lost 80% of your value and you're only growing 15 to 20%, it's going to take you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3361.2s	3361.2	 However, good private companies, not all of them, but the great ones, they're still growing 3x
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3365.6s	3365.6	 year over year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3366.7s	3366.7	 So if you're able to grow 3x year over year and you do it two years in a row, you're 9x
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3371.6s	3371.6	 where you were.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3372.5s	3372.5	 Even if the ARR multiple collapsed 80%, you can still get an up round.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3377.1s	3377.1	 It's not going to be the 9x up round.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3379.2s	3379.2	 It might be a 2x up round.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3381.1s	3381.1	 I know how that's mathematically true, but listen, if you're a hundred million dollar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3386.0s	3386.0	 ARR business, let's just say you were able to raise at 10 or 11 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3391.9s	3391.9	 Yes, you're mathematically right that, you know, 100 million times nine is 900 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3398.3s	3398.3	 But I think it's important to first say how many actual software companies are there that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3403.3s	3403.3	 generate a billion dollars of ARR?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3405.3s	3405.3	 Do you remember when Salesforce first passed a billion dollars of ARR?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3408.4s	3408.4	 We thought, my gosh, and then they said, my god, so this is exceptionally rare error.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3414.4s	3414.4	 And I think that it behooves people to understand that law of large numbers aren't often
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3419.6s	3419.6	 violated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3421.2s	3421.2	 And so, you know, before you go and do that simple math and convince yourself that it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3425.4s	3425.4	 possible, maybe you should actually not, I'm not saying that to you, Saks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3428.6s	3428.6	 I'm saying that to the founder or to the boards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3430.8s	3430.8	 Maybe you guys should actually just go in and have somebody run a screen and say, how many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3434.9s	3434.9	 actual companies exist that have actually managed to generate more than a billion dollars of ARR,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3439.3s	3439.3	 especially in a moment where people are cutting back on spend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3442.5s	3442.5	 How does that happen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3444.7s	3444.7	 Yeah, I agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3445.4s	3445.4	 Getting from 100 to a billion is really hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3448.0s	3448.0	 You know, if you're getting a billion dollar company supposed to do, because in this math,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3452.2s	3452.2	 they have to get to two billion dollars of ARR to be worth 10 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3456.1s	3456.1	 I do think a lot of how do we do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3457.8s	3457.8	 How does the random SaaS company that you and I have never heard of, how do they generate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3462.8s	3462.8	 two billion of ARR?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3463.7s	3463.7	 I can tell you the handful of companies that generate two billion of ARR.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3466.7s	3466.7	 There are some incredible companies today that don't even yet, you know, like look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3471.2s	3471.2	 an incredible company like Unity, incredible, the backbone of all, you know, gaming and,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3476.6s	3476.6	 you know, the move to 3D this year, if they crush, they'll do 1.3 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3482.7s	3482.7	 Credible business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3485.4s	3485.4	 It just went down 35%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3486.4s	3486.4	 It just went down 35%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3488.4s	3488.4	 It's unbelievable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3489.6s	3489.6	 It's trading at four times revenue, guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3492.8s	3492.8	 Some of these things are hard to believe, like Open Door has 2.3 billion in cash and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3496.4s	3496.4	 a 3.7 billion dollar market cap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3498.8s	3498.8	 That enterprise value 1.4.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3500.7s	3500.7	 I think they also have a couple of billion in real estate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3503.2s	3503.2	 Coinbase 6 billion cash, 12 billion dollar market cap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3505.7s	3505.7	 So I guess in this part in the discussion, even with all these headwinds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3510.7s	3510.7	 can we give the protective mechanisms for employees?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3512.9s	3512.9	 Because I again, I just okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3514.3s	3514.3	 Good, good point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3514.8s	3514.8	 Let's do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3515.6s	3515.6	 When you start a company and you're a founder, you have you're taking the most risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3520.7s	3520.7	 You're the person with the idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3522.7s	3522.7	 You should be justly rewarded for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3524.7s	3524.7	 The way that that happens economically in a company is you get founder shares.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3530.1s	3530.1	 The basis of those founder shares are effectively zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3533.9s	3533.9	 And you're able to do a bunch of structuring when you first start a company that gives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3539.2s	3539.2	 founders specifically some incredible tax advantages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3543.2s	3543.2	 You can do an 83B election, which is effectively you buying the stock,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3547.6s	3547.6	 starting the clock on long term capital gains, etc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3550.4s	3550.4	 etc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3551.9s	3551.9	 Then you have stock that you give to employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3555.1s	3555.1	 They're one of two kinds, non-qualified stock options and incentivized stock options,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3559.8s	3559.8	 NSOs and ISOs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3562.7s	3562.7	 And those have different tax treatments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3565.5s	3565.5	 But again, you know, when you're a very early employee,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3568.7s	3568.7	 you get a mixture of these things also hugely accretive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3572.9s	3572.9	 It has a very low basis, your building value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3577.0s	3577.0	 But here's what people don't understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3579.5s	3579.5	 When a venture investor like myself or Jason explain basis, by the way, for people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3584.1s	3584.1	 for the basis, your price of your stock is effectively zero, you know, like a penny
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3590.0s	3590.0	 for it or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3590.8s	3590.8	 Yeah, like, like the my stock at Facebook costs like half a penny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3594.3s	3594.3	 Got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3595.4s	3595.4	 Whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3596.0s	3596.0	 It goes public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3596.8s	3596.8	 It's $1520.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3597.6s	3597.6	 You get the spread.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3598.3s	3598.3	 Got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3598.8s	3598.8	 You get the spread.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3600.0s	3600.0	 And you pay long term capital gains on that if you've been able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3603.8s	3603.8	 not in contact and and and shift it to long term capital gains.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3608.0s	3608.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3608.9s	3608.9	 So now, Sachs or Jason or myself come and invest in your company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3613.3s	3613.3	 What happens?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3614.4s	3614.4	 We actually don't get equity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3615.7s	3615.7	 We don't get common stock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3617.3s	3617.3	 We actually get a synthetic form of debt called the preferred share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3622.3s	3622.3	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3622.9s	3622.9	 And typically, the way that it works is when we invest in a company, and this is how the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3627.0s	3627.0	 entire venture ecosystem works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3629.7s	3629.7	 We actually create what's called a preference stack, which means we get an instrument
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3635.8s	3635.8	 that is senior to the common equity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3639.4s	3639.4	 Now, what does that mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3640.6s	3640.6	 Well, it means that if your business goes out of business, we get our money back first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3646.7s	3646.7	 We also get an interest rate, and we're able to convert all of that at some point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3650.8s	3650.8	 the magical moment when a company goes public into common stock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3655.6s	3655.6	 And we give up our preferred rights.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3657.7s	3657.7	 And we now have the same instrument as everybody else when a company goes public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3661.5s	3661.5	 That's the typical mechanism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3663.2s	3663.2	 Why does that exist, by the way, the preferred shares maybe explaining the why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3666.6s	3666.6	 Why do VCs need that protection?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3668.4s	3668.4	 To be honest, I don't know why it started, but it's a historical artifact of, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3673.0s	3673.0	 the 1960s and 70s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3674.8s	3674.8	 I think I know why it started.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3676.6s	3676.6	 Okay, so this got lawyered because let's say you start a company,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3681.6s	3681.6	 and just to use some round numbers, a investor wants to give you $10 million to start the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3686.3s	3686.3	 company and for 10% of the company, $100 million valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3690.5s	3690.5	 If you didn't have preferred shares, then the founders could basically,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3695.8s	3695.8	 the day after the money comes in, could say, hey, we want to liquidate the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3698.8s	3698.8	 We decided we don't want to do this anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3700.7s	3700.7	 And they own 90% of the company, and they could basically then distribute out the 10 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3704.4s	3704.4	 to all the shareholders, and they would keep nine, and one million would go back to the investor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3708.8s	3708.8	 So that's why lawyers came with this idea of seniority.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3712.3s	3712.3	 So that, okay, if you disband the company, with the investors money still in there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3718.0s	3718.0	 it goes back first to the people who put in the money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3720.5s	3720.5	 That was the idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3721.3s	3721.3	 And when the second piece was, if the company gets sold for less than the cash put into it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3725.3s	3725.3	 at least the people with the cash and get their money out first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3728.3s	3728.3	 So if it sells for 10 million, you get your 10 million back or 11, you get 1 million after that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3733.2s	3733.2	 So let's just say Jason does the first million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3735.5s	3735.5	 So there now there's a million of preferred.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3737.5s	3737.5	 Then Sachs does the series A and he puts in 10.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3740.0s	3740.0	 Now there's 11 million of preferred, even if it's at a much higher valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3744.0s	3744.0	 And then I come in and I give 100 at an even higher valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3747.3s	3747.3	 So now there's $111 million of preferred shares.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3752.0s	3752.0	 Now, if the company goes through all kinds of complications and mess,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3757.0s	3757.0	 and let's just say we have to sell it to somebody else for $200 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3760.7s	3760.7	 Well, guess what happens?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3762.0s	3762.0	 The first 111 of it comes back to myself, Jason and David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3765.6s	3765.6	 Plus interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3766.6s	3766.6	 So this is why venture investors have an incentive to pay and set these crazy valuations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3772.3s	3772.3	 because they don't really care what the valuation is as much as they care how much of all this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3777.9s	3777.9	 preference is building.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3779.0s	3779.0	 And do I rationally believe that the liquidation value of the company is at least that much money?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3786.4s	3786.4	 So if I think that Friedberg's company is worth at least $111 million, I'll do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3790.7s	3790.7	 And I add my 100.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3792.3s	3792.3	 Now, why is this important for employees?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3794.8s	3794.8	 Before you join a startup, especially in this moment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3798.3s	3798.3	 I think it's very important for you to understand how much money have they raised?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3804.0s	3804.0	 How much is this preference stack that exists?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3807.5s	3807.5	 And do you believe that the company is going to be worth much more than that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3812.4s	3812.4	 Because that's the only way that you're going to actually participate in the equity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3816.5s	3816.5	 And we know now what the public markets say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3818.8s	3818.8	 So if you go back to that tweet, you know, if it's a 10 or an $11 billion company,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3824.2s	3824.2	 okay, well, you need to generate $2 billion of revenue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3827.7s	3827.7	 And if you're at 100 million, that means you have to 20 X the revenue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3832.2s	3832.2	 for the valuation to be worthwhile for you to believe that this valuation is real.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3837.2s	3837.2	 So this is just a little guide for employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3839.4s	3839.4	 I just think it's very important that you guys start to do the math and start to figure this out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3842.9s	3842.9	 Ask the hard questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3844.7s	3844.7	 How many shares are outstanding?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3846.6s	3846.6	 How many preferred shares?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3847.7s	3847.7	 What's the overhang?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3848.6s	3848.6	 What's my strike price preference stack?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3851.0s	3851.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3851.3s	3851.3	 You know, how much is the total press stack?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3853.6s	3853.6	 How much revenue are we generating now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3856.2s	3856.2	 You should go and do the work to figure out what the public market comps are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3860.2s	3860.2	 Those are widely available.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3861.6s	3861.6	 Hopefully somebody quit actually just create a website that helps you do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3865.2s	3865.2	 But all of these things are going to be very important for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3867.5s	3867.5	 Otherwise, what will happen is if you join a company in this moment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3871.2s	3871.2	 at a fake valuation, and the valuation gets reset,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3875.0s	3875.0	 you can effectively assume your options are worth zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3877.6s	3877.6	 So if that was a important part of how you made the decision to join that company,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3882.2s	3882.2	 you're being somewhat misled in a moment like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3885.9s	3885.9	 And you need to have your own rational sense of what that company is worth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3888.7s	3888.7	 Conversely, I think boards and CEOs have a real responsibility now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3893.4s	3893.4	 to do the hard work of resetting this and explaining it to their employees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3896.3s	3896.3	 if they want to retain them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3897.9s	3897.9	 Because in a moment like this, if you have a valuation reset,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3900.8s	3900.8	 you don't allow people to understand it and you don't figure out a way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3903.8s	3903.8	 to allow them to participate in some incremental way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3906.5s	3906.5	 I think it's going to be very problematic for employee retention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3909.0s	3909.0	 You're going to have to check.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3910.9s	3910.9	 In those contexts, look, there's a couple of things that I always support.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3916.6s	3916.6	 If you need to reprice the options, you can reprice the options
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3920.2s	3920.2	 and give employees the benefit of a new foreign INA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3922.8s	3922.8	 So the company doesn't set the option price that's set by an external foreign INA audit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3928.4s	3928.4	 But if that foreign INA goes down because of these factors we're talking about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3934.6s	3934.6	 you can basically, the board can vote to reprice everyone's options.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3938.0s	3938.0	 So at least they get the benefit of the lower foreign INA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3940.0s	3940.0	 Explain what a foreign INA is, just broad strokes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3944.1s	3944.1	 Basically, when stock options are issued, the law requires that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3948.6s	3948.6	 the strike price of the option be the fair market price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3952.7s	3952.7	 Because of some accounting shenanigans a while back that got companies in trouble,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3959.4s	3959.4	 it is now the case that companies don't set, don't determine their own fair market price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3964.0s	3964.0	 They go out and they get some external auditor to do a foreign INA audit and then the foreign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3969.9s	3969.9	 INA, that gives you the fair market price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3972.3s	3972.3	 And specifically, it's the fair market price of the common stock because what investors are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3976.2s	3976.2	 buying is the preferred.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3977.6s	3977.6	 Because of the dynamic that Chamath is talking about where the preferred gets paid back first,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3982.4s	3982.4	 the common stock is worth less per share because it's got this overhang on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3986.8s	3986.8	 Typically a fraction, a fifth, a tenth, something in that range is typically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3990.8s	3990.8	 So if the shares were worth a dollar preferred, the fair market value of the common could be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3996.0s	3996.0	 five cents, 10 cents, 15 cents, depends on if the company is going to run out of money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=3999.9s	3999.9	 how many months of runway they have, are they profitable?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4002.4s	4002.4	 And so it is a fair thing to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4004.2s	4004.2	 And you have to know that in a down market like this, if you had massive compression,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4009.5s	4009.5	 boards need to look at that founders need to look at and say, hey, listen, if the SaaS multiples
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4014.4s	4014.4	 come down so much, well, our fair market value should come down that much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4018.4s	4018.4	 The fair market value might be worth 50% less, 75% less, correct, Sachs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4023.1s	4023.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4023.3s	4023.3	 I mean, so the way it works is that when a company IPOs, you get rid of all the different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4027.7s	4027.7	 classes of stock, you know, the, everything, basically the preferred converts to common
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4031.7s	4031.7	 in an IPO.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4032.7s	4032.7	 One class of shares.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4034.3s	4034.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4034.4s	4034.4	 Maybe you have like the dual stocks of the founder can maintain control, but from an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4037.2s	4037.2	 economic perspective, you basically collapse into common stock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4041.3s	4041.3	 So when you IPO, common and preferred are the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4045.2s	4045.2	 And so economically they're converging to one-to-one as the company gets more and more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4049.9s	4049.9	 mature and heads towards an exit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4052.6s	4052.6	 The earlier that you are, the riskier the company is, the more that the pref stack matters,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4058.8s	4058.8	 the more overhang that creates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4060.7s	4060.7	 But the benefit to employees is it creates a larger discount on their strike price on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4064.9s	4064.9	 the 49A.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4065.8s	4065.8	 So that is the offsetting benefit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4068.0s	4068.0	 If the 49A goes down because the markets change, then the board can vote to apply a new 49A
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4074.5s	4074.5	 to the employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4075.4s	4075.4	 That's a beneficial thing to do for everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4078.4s	4078.4	 So that's something, you know, I've always supported.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4080.9s	4080.9	 The other thing is that if you're in a turnaround situation where you're actually worried
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4084.8s	4084.8	 that the pref stack is larger than the value of the company, in other words, more money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4089.1s	4089.1	 has gone into the company, then the company may be worth an exit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4092.8s	4092.8	 Then what you need to do, because then there's nothing for the employees, there's no incentive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4096.3s	4096.3	 anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4097.1s	4097.1	 What you need to do is create a basically an employee participation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4104.5s	4104.5	 You create a corridor where you say, okay, 30% of any acquisition price for this company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4110.1s	4110.1	 is going to go to the employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4111.2s	4111.2	 You create a management or employee carve out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4114.4s	4114.4	 Really, it should be an employee carve out, not just management, but all the employees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4117.6s	4117.6	 of the company should benefit from an acquisition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4121.6s	4121.6	 Sometimes you'll see boards be either unrealistic or stingy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4125.1s	4125.1	 They'll be kind of penny wise and pound foolish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4127.2s	4127.2	 They won't create the incentive for the employees to get that sort of overcapitalized company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4132.9s	4132.9	 across the finish line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4134.4s	4134.4	 And, you know, it can be pretty frustrating to see when that happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4138.4s	4138.4	 It's a good time for employees to understand this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4140.4s	4140.4	 This is a giant reset that's occurring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4143.1s	4143.1	 I think there is some good news here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4146.6s	4146.6	 I think we have a lot more people who are going to go back to work because they need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4149.6s	4149.6	 to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4150.4s	4150.4	 And that'll be good for monetary velocity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4152.3s	4152.3	 Fill these jobs, 11 million jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4154.4s	4154.4	 I don't know if we've ever had this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4155.6s	4155.6	 I think it's a record the number of jobs we've had and we're bouncing along record low unemployment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4159.5s	4159.5	 Those two things could be what saves us could save us during this recession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4162.7s	4162.7	 It's something distinctly unique about this recession is job openings and low unemployment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4168.6s	4168.6	 We've never had a recession like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4171.6s	4171.6	 So that's just fascinating in and of itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4174.0s	4174.0	 But for employees and for companies, the new discipline might be there's not going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4178.1s	4178.1	 four or five offers for every tech employee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4180.3s	4180.3	 If people are going to cut 10 to 25%, this is the contagion moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4184.4s	4184.4	 And I think maybe just talking about layoff contagion in tech and how that works because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4189.6s	4189.6	 Facebook's on a hiring freeze and you're starting to see the series BC companies all do 10 to 25%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4195.0s	4195.0	 layoffs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4196.4s	4196.4	 Uber, Dara said we're going to look at hiring as a luxury.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4199.2s	4199.2	 That's probably not going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4201.2s	4201.2	 The only person who said they were going to hire into this was Google.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4205.0s	4205.0	 Sundar today said maybe as many as 12,000 people over the next couple of years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4209.7s	4209.7	 a couple thousand a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4212.0s	4212.0	 And Apple, stunningly, I don't know if you're watching this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4216.1s	4216.1	 they have told people we're one day a week now, two days a week and two weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4220.6s	4220.6	 And then by the end of this month, May, there'll be three days a week in the office mandatory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4225.0s	4225.0	 The head of machine learning said, yeah, that doesn't work for my team.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4227.9s	4227.9	 And they said, okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4229.2s	4229.2	 And he said, okay, we don't have to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4230.6s	4230.6	 And they said, no, okay, we accept your resignation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4232.8s	4232.8	 So I think even the mighty Apple with unlimited cash reserves are saying, you know what,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4236.6s	4236.6	 if we have to shed some people who don't want to come back to the office,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4239.3s	4239.3	 that's like a de facto layoff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4240.7s	4240.7	 So maybe talking about this contagion, because if you're a company that doesn't lay off people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4245.3s	4245.3	 you're going to look pretty weird in this market to your investors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4247.9s	4247.9	 And they're going to be wondering why aren't you laying people off?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4249.6s	4249.6	 Go ahead, Freeburn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4250.4s	4250.4	 I feel like an old guy now, been working in Silicon Valley for 20 years, 20, 21 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4256.7s	4256.7	 And I remember like in 01, there was kind of this period of time when there was a bunch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4260.8s	4260.8	 of layoffs and a bunch of companies, reduced headcount.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4264.8s	4264.8	 And, you know, there were other industries and people stayed employed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4268.1s	4268.1	 And then in the years that followed, like Web 2 happened and people kind of came back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4272.0s	4272.0	 But what was interesting is like the tech industry, which at the time was Silicon Valley,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4276.4s	4276.4	 but is now fairly kind of, you know, well dispersed, attracted a lot of people from other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4282.5s	4282.5	 industries, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4283.1s	4283.1	 It used to be cool to get a job in financial services or investment banking out of college.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4286.8s	4286.8	 And then all of a sudden, working at a startup was the cool thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4289.2s	4289.2	 And there are a lot of people that moved from New York in the last couple of years to SF,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4293.9s	4293.9	 leading up to the most recent crash after the pandemic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4296.9s	4296.9	 And so, you know, look, there is an ebb and a flow in and out of this industry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4301.6s	4301.6	 I do think that this capital overhang, however, this quarter trillion dollars of dry powder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4306.5s	4306.5	 that's sitting in VC coffers is going to be significantly stimulatory in a very good way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4312.9s	4312.9	 I think it will create real jobs and enable real progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4315.8s	4315.8	 It's not just about the companies that are on the brink of profitability or the companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4318.8s	4318.8	 that are profitable trying to juice profits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4321.2s	4321.2	 If you take a step back, Jake, how you said something earlier that I thought was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4326.6s	4326.6	 kind of a really important statement, which is like you're doing deals, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4331.1s	4331.1	 You're making investments in startups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4333.2s	4333.2	 Oh, I'm more excited than I've been in years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4336.0s	4336.0	 This is my time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4337.2s	4337.2	 This is what I love.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4338.0s	4338.0	 This is your time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4338.6s	4338.6	 It's time to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4340.0s	4340.0	 And so I talked earlier about how the capital stimulants that came out from the Fed and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4347.1s	4347.1	 the bond buying they were doing and so on led to an inflation and a bunch of assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4351.2s	4351.2	 That capital ultimately didn't find its way into productive assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4354.5s	4354.5	 But it's not about all of that capital finding its way into productive assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4358.2s	4358.2	 If enough of it find its way into productive assets, productive assets meaning businesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4362.9s	4362.9	 that create something of value for customers and make money doing so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4366.4s	4366.4	 And as a result can grow and create new jobs and create new areas of the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4371.4s	4371.4	 If that happens enough times over, there is enough growth in the economy and enough new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4376.0s	4376.0	 jobs that are created that really rationalizes all of the money that was frigging wasted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4381.1s	4381.1	 on speculative nonsense over the past few years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4383.8s	4383.8	 And I think the fact that we've got a quarter trillion dollars sitting in VC Coffers more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4387.1s	4387.1	 than we've ever had.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4388.1s	4388.1	 That's a quarter trillion dollars ready to fund the next generation of technology businesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4394.0s	4394.0	 that can build new jobs and create new areas of the economy, new areas of growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4398.1s	4398.1	 that we've never seen before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4399.6s	4399.6	 And that's what's happened in the past.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4401.1s	4401.1	 How do you think a person, let's just say you're playing poker and you just get punched
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4406.3s	4406.3	 in the face seven rounds in a row, you're stuck three biens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4411.6s	4411.6	 How does that person make that good next decision?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4414.6s	4414.6	 Now, I will tell you three stories from my last week because my last week has been filled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4418.6s	4418.6	 with these experiences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4419.4s	4419.4	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4419.6s	4419.6	 Sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4419.9s	4419.9	 Go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4420.8s	4420.8	 So let me just talk about the business of investing and the psychology of investing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4426.5s	4426.5	 So look at probably who has been the most incredible performer this year is Ken Griffin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4433.0s	4433.0	 and Citadel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4434.4s	4434.4	 And right underneath him is this guy, Izzy Englander who runs a place called Millennium.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4439.8s	4439.8	 And then, you know, a close third would probably be Stevie Cohen at SAC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4444.8s	4444.8	 Now, how do these guys run their business?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4446.9s	4446.9	 They have hundreds and hundreds of teams investing in all kinds of different things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4453.8s	4453.8	 And what they figured out over time is how to dial up and dial down the volume of who's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4460.2s	4460.2	 performing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4461.2s	4461.2	 And what they have realized is that when you go through a pattern of losing money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4467.0s	4467.0	 it is very difficult for you to then make incrementally good decisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4472.0s	4472.0	 And so they have a dynamic system that allows them to move capital away from those folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4478.2s	4478.2	 who are psychologically not in a great place to do it, to move capital towards other folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4482.1s	4482.1	 who are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4482.9s	4482.9	 As a result, they are always winning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4486.0s	4486.0	 And I just want you to react to that because I think there's one thing that we can say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4489.8s	4489.8	 oh, venture is a special thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4491.6s	4491.6	 It's not like anything else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4493.5s	4493.5	 I personally don't think so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4494.9s	4494.9	 Operating across the entire lifecycle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4497.9s	4497.9	 And I think that there's something to be said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4499.6s	4499.6	 And I saw it in 2000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4501.4s	4501.4	 Folks who have lost a lot of money make incrementally poor decisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4505.5s	4505.5	 I think why Jason is firing a little bit of a hot hand was he mostly let his companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4511.2s	4511.2	 get marked up and he was mostly frustrated the last couple of years in valuations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4516.4s	4516.4	 Early stage valuations, lack of discipline.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4518.8s	4518.8	 He's operating effectively in slate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4521.4s	4521.4	 But I don't think it's a binary condition, Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4524.2s	4524.2	 I think generally what you're saying is right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4526.0s	4526.0	 I'll tell you the reaction I'm seeing in the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4528.3s	4528.3	 One last thing to add to your thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4529.8s	4529.8	 And on top of that, there are only seven or eight people who've actually made money in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4533.9s	4533.9	 this entire market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4535.5s	4535.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4537.7s	4537.7	 Early stage investors have done well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4539.4s	4539.4	 Early stage investors have done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4540.5s	4540.5	 We returned our first fund.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4542.0s	4542.0	 That was nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4542.8s	4542.8	 I'm in the black.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4543.7s	4543.7	 Stacks, you, girlie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4546.7s	4546.7	 I mean, what about all the other thousands of people that raise this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4550.2s	4550.2	 You got to distribute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4550.8s	4550.8	 People don't distribute shares.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4552.0s	4552.0	 We've talked about this a couple of times, Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4553.9s	4553.9	 It's so hard to make money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4555.3s	4555.3	 And when you have a chance to distribute, I feel really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4558.8s	4558.8	 I've gone to some of these companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4561.5s	4561.5	 I have a Bloomberg at my desk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4562.8s	4562.8	 And one thing that I look at every now and then is the ownership table
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4566.3s	4566.3	 of some of these high flying stocks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4568.5s	4568.5	 And you'll see some incredible things, which is these folks have held on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4573.0s	4573.0	 and they are holding billions of dollars now of paper losses that they have to go back to their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4578.4s	4578.4	 LPs and say, hard conversation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4580.8s	4580.8	 Mrs. Foundation, I know that you wanted to fund cancer research.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4584.5s	4584.5	 You know, I had $9 billion of gains and now it's two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4589.2s	4589.2	 Oops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4590.8s	4590.8	 So look, I think what you're saying generally is right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4594.6s	4594.6	 People are psychologically tainted when they take a big hit in the face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4597.9s	4597.9	 Everyone has this experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4600.8s	4600.8	 My observation over the past two weeks, I have seen a lot of PMs and public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4606.1s	4606.1	 PMs, portfolio managers, as well as private VCs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4610.0s	4610.0	 All react to me in the same way when opportunities have kind of been discussed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4614.4s	4614.4	 which is I'm sitting on my hands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4616.5s	4616.5	 I mean, there is a PM I saw this week of a, you know, anyway, I would say I've never seen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4623.3s	4623.3	 him jarred like I've never seen him just shocked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4626.1s	4626.1	 Like we were talking about something that was so obviously up his alley, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4631.6s	4631.6	 such a great fit for him, but he is just not doing anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4636.6s	4636.6	 And so worried about career us now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4639.1s	4639.1	 I mean, I had a crossover investor tell me that, look, I think that things are oversold right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4645.5s	4645.5	 This is an attractive time to buy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4646.8s	4646.8	 They won't take an act.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4648.6s	4648.6	 Because look, if I'm right that they're oversold and it goes up, great, I make a little bit of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4652.4s	4652.4	 money, but if I'm wrong, I'm not just losing money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4655.4s	4655.4	 Two mistakes in a row.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4656.0s	4656.0	 I'm risking my career.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4657.6s	4657.6	 I'm catching falling knives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4659.2s	4659.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4659.4s	4659.4	 So why would I do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4660.4s	4660.4	 I'm just going to sit and wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4661.2s	4661.2	 I'm the opposite right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4662.4s	4662.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4662.8s	4662.8	 Guys, the same is true in VC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4664.3s	4664.3	 So I had several VCs this week who kind of shared the same point of view,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4668.1s	4668.1	 which is at our partnership meetings, I don't know what you guys are doing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4670.9s	4670.9	 Sachs, at your fund, but they're like at our partnership meetings,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4674.0s	4674.0	 we just cannot align on whether or not we're paying the right valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4677.2s	4677.2	 And so we're at a standstill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4678.7s	4678.7	 We're just waiting to see when the quote market settles out and then we'll make decisions because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4683.2s	4683.2	 I don't want to be the guy in the VC context catching knives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4686.4s	4686.4	 But look, that's a near term psychological phenomenon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4689.6s	4689.6	 I think the reaction, Chamath, is everyone sitting on their hands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4692.2s	4692.2	 But over time, it's not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4694.0s	4694.0	 I just told you the data for the last 30 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4696.9s	4696.9	 Only 22 out of 1300 funds have returned more than 2.3 times a billion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4702.5s	4702.5	 It's not near term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4703.7s	4703.7	 That's not the point I was trying to make earlier, which was there's a quarter trillion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4707.8s	4707.8	 We got that point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4708.4s	4708.4	 It's a macro point about the fact that there is going to be funding available.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4712.9s	4712.9	 It doesn't matter if these guys are going to make money or not,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4715.9s	4715.9	 or they're going to make shitty investments or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4718.1s	4718.1	 There is going to be a stimulatory effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4720.1s	4720.1	 All you need is one of the next trillion dollar mega caps to emerge from the quarter trillion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4726.0s	4726.0	 that's sitting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4726.8s	4726.8	 For the entire industry to look fantastic and for that business to transform the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4731.2s	4731.2	 landscape of some party economy and for many new jobs to be created.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4737.2s	4737.2	 By the way, we've never seen that in history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4738.8s	4738.8	 We've never had this much dry powder sitting on the sidelines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4741.6s	4741.6	 This is where the free money should go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4743.6s	4743.6	 It should go to creating new companies that create new jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4746.7s	4746.7	 It is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4747.1s	4747.1	 It's found its way there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4748.4s	4748.4	 The trillions of dollars that have fueled crazy asset bubbles left and right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4752.6s	4752.6	 some amount of it made its way into funding the creation of new companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4756.8s	4756.8	 that are going to create jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4758.0s	4758.0	 And that is the good thing of what's happened over the last couple of years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4760.9s	4760.9	 despite the asset implosion of all these bubbly things that have happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4764.4s	4764.4	 Amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4764.8s	4764.8	 Shemath, I wanted to answer your question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4766.1s	4766.1	 So what do you do if you get punched in the face seven times?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4768.1s	4768.1	 You're running bad in a poker game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4770.8s	4770.8	 If you look at Phil Helmuth or other people who go through that variance,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4775.4s	4775.4	 well, you take a break, go for a walk around the pool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4777.5s	4777.5	 Sometimes you pick up your chips and you pick a different game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4779.6s	4779.6	 Smaller game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4780.8s	4780.8	 One thing I like to think about is, hey, I'm going to play better cards to start your hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4786.4s	4786.4	 and maybe play in position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4787.6s	4787.6	 And in the analogy here, playing better cards, backing better founders and better products,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4793.6s	4793.6	 and then playing in position, knowing we're in the life cycle of a company value is created.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4798.2s	4798.2	 And that goes to valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4799.6s	4799.6	 So I'm laser focused right now on just world-class teams that are running their business as well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4805.1s	4805.1	 and that I can invest in early.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4806.8s	4806.8	 And if there are founders out there who are trying to figure this out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4811.2s	4811.2	 and they're not getting funding, I think looking, I think you said this last week,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4814.2s	4814.2	 Saxo, that maybe two weeks ago, hey, listen, your last valuation last year is a great valuation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4819.1s	4819.1	 this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4819.6s	4819.6	 And if you had people who wanted to invest last year who couldn't get in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4823.1s	4823.1	 going back to your $30 million valuation last year and topping off $3 million with the people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4827.8s	4827.8	 who couldn't get in and you told them, I'll come back to you when it's $90 million, go see if they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4832.4s	4832.4	 still want to put that bet in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4833.8s	4833.8	 And then for the VCs are out there in the early stage, you know, making bets on sub $15 million,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4839.6s	4839.6	 sub $12 million companies in the seed round.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4843.2s	4843.2	 If they're focused on customers and product, you know, you've got a couple of hundred K and revenue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4848.3s	4848.3	 I think it's a good bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4850.0s	4850.0	 And I'm going to increase our investing in those type of companies, under 20 million,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4855.0s	4855.0	 under 15 million focused teams who understand that the climate has changed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4859.2s	4859.2	 If you're not taking the medicine, you have to sax is excellent tweet storm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4865.2s	4865.2	 you're DQ from funding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4866.5s	4866.5	 I think it's very important that people understand what sex said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4869.2s	4869.2	 If you do not accept the reality of VC who has lived through one, two or three of these cycles
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4875.6s	4875.6	 is going to disqualify you and they're not telling you why they're disqualifying you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4878.7s	4878.7	 It's just not a fit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4879.7s	4879.7	 Couldn't get my partners around it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4881.5s	4881.5	 You know, let's keep in touch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4882.6s	4882.6	 Let me know how it can be helpful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4883.7s	4883.7	 The other thing is an entire generation of investors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4887.5s	4887.5	 have been coddling entrepreneurs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4890.2s	4890.2	 And in moments like this, sometimes you need to actually have hard conversations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4894.2s	4894.2	 And if yes, yes, I don't know how you tell that entrepreneur, listen, you need to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4898.2s	4898.2	 actually five days a week in the office, you need to do a 25% riff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4903.0s	4903.0	 You need to stop all the extraneous spend, forget the exposed brick walls and the kind bars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4908.1s	4908.1	 we need to get down to just ones and zeros.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4911.9s	4911.9	 That's also an entire generation of capital allocators who don't know how to do this job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4916.8s	4916.8	 in a moment like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4918.1s	4918.1	 They've never had those conversations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4919.7s	4919.7	 They've never had those conversations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4921.3s	4921.3	 Just to build on Friedbrook's point, the idea that you would be at a standstill about price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4926.8s	4926.8	 in a moment like this to me is shocking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4929.5s	4929.5	 If I mean, if I was an LP in that venture fund, I would write it to zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4934.3s	4934.3	 There should be no intellectual standstill whatsoever in a moment like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4939.0s	4939.0	
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4939.0s	4939.0	 You know, we're still investing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4941.4s	4941.4	 What the prices are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4942.8s	4942.8	 Yeah, we're still investing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4943.9s	4943.9	 It's just that lower valuations should be no sand still exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4947.3s	4947.3	 This is the time to invest, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4949.1s	4949.1	 I mean, yeah, I want to say something sort of positive because a lot of founders watched
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4953.3s	4953.3	 the show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4954.3s	4954.3	 It's like, look, what Jason said, if you need to accept reality, and if you don't,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4958.3s	4958.3	 you're going to have a bucket of very cold water dumped on your head when you got in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4962.6s	4962.6	 fundraise and realize that you're not going to make it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4964.7s	4964.7	 And then all of a sudden, you're going to be packing up shop very quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4967.9s	4967.9	 So you got to get a reality check and understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4972.0s	4972.0	 But look, great companies are built during downturns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4975.1s	4975.1	 You know, PayPal was built during the dot com crash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4978.5s	4978.5	 My company Yammer was built during the Great Recession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4980.9s	4980.9	 Google, Uber.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4982.2s	4982.2	 Totally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4982.5s	4982.5	 I mean, the list goes on and on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4983.8s	4983.8	 So downturns are great times to build companies because the war for talent subsides.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4988.3s	4988.3	 So it's so much easier to recruit people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4990.2s	4990.2	 There's a lot fewer competitors getting funded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4992.3s	4992.3	 So there's way less noise in the ecosystem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4994.8s	4994.8	 The only thing that gets harder is fundraising.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4997.0s	4997.0	 So you need to make sure that your money lasts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=4999.2s	4999.2	 You do the right things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5000.7s	5000.7	 You focus on business fundamentals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5002.2s	5002.2	 You don't dequeue yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5003.6s	5003.6	 David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5004.3s	5004.3	 And if you do that, you'll be fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5006.4s	5006.4	 You just brought up something incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5008.0s	5008.0	 I remember we raised money from Microsoft at a $15.3 billion valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5013.9s	5013.9	 The great financial crisis took hold and marked to his credit, reset the valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5020.6s	5020.6	 We were already profitable, so we didn't necessarily need to raise that money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5024.8s	5024.8	 But I think we raised a billion dollars at like a $9 billion valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5028.6s	5028.6	 So we took a 33, 40% haircut.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5031.5s	5031.5	 A down round.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5032.3s	5032.3	 Facebook had a down round.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5034.1s	5034.1	 We padded our balance sheet and we said, we are now going to go and crush.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5037.5s	5037.5	 And to your point, we were really able to compete much more effectively coming out of the GFC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5042.8s	5042.8	 against Google for talent and against everybody else in that moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5046.6s	5046.6	 And so if this is what people like Zuck are willing to do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5050.8s	5050.8	 you have to really hold people's feet to the fire for founders who are not him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5056.7s	5056.7	 What is the fast co-founder willing to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5059.2s	5059.2	 You know, like shut it down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5060.4s	5060.4	 Like literally, there's some founders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5062.6s	5062.6	 I find this very disturbing, but there are some founders who are so unwilling to make the cuts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5066.8s	5066.8	 or take the medicine that they would rather run the fucking car into the wall and hit the brakes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5071.4s	5071.4	 Like hit the fucking brakes, save your company, live to fight another day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5075.6s	5075.6	 If you have six months of runway, get to 12 and try to live.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5080.2s	5080.2	 Raise your prices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5081.7s	5081.7	 You're totally right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5082.4s	5082.4	 Every single company that hits the wall and goes out of business that didn't do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5086.2s	5086.2	 a round of layoffs 12 months before was asleep at the wheel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5090.0s	5090.0	 I see that they were literally texting and driving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5092.0s	5092.0	 They were texting and driving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5093.6s	5093.6	 Where was the round of layoffs a year before they ran out of money that at least gave them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5097.9s	5097.9	 more runway?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5098.4s	5098.4	 They didn't even do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5099.5s	5099.5	 They just assume they could go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5101.4s	5101.4	 David, if you think about it, your series, your seed round was hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5104.7s	5104.7	 Getting into Y Combinator was hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5106.0s	5106.0	 Your series A, okay, it was, it was hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5108.4s	5108.4	 You had to do 25 meetings, but you got a term sheet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5110.5s	5110.5	 Your series B, you had five people offer your term sheets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5113.6s	5113.6	 Your series D, C and D were people begging you to take their money and saying, name a price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5119.0s	5119.0	 So what does that founder think the next round of funding is going to be?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5122.4s	5122.4	 Each round became less work and higher valuations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5126.6s	5126.6	 You know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5127.2s	5127.2	 A generation also, not all founders, but there's a group of founders who became better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5132.5s	5132.5	 at selling VCs on investing in their company than selling customers on buying their product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5138.4s	5138.4	 You have to take the same focus you had of selling people on buying shares in your company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5143.3s	5143.3	 and put that into your product, the actual service and raise your prices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5146.8s	5146.8	 So many people are charging so little for their SaaS product or software.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5150.3s	5150.3	 And they're like, I can't make this business work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5151.8s	5151.8	 And we say to them, if you doubled or tripled your price, would you lose?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5154.8s	5154.8	 What percentage of customers would you lose?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5156.5s	5156.5	 And they say, we'd lose like 10%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5158.0s	5158.0	 And I'm like, did you just, you have a million in revenue, 2 million, 10% off 2 million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5164.1s	5164.1	 You've got 1.8.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5165.0s	5165.0	 Would you rather make 800,000 more and be break even right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5167.5s	5167.5	 And there are two months, sometimes founders just have this amazing moment where like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5170.9s	5170.9	 oh yeah, I guess we could charge more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5172.1s	5172.1	 And if we lost some customers, that wouldn't be the end of the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5174.1s	5174.1	 And we'd be profitable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5174.9s	5174.9	 I think this speaks to the fact that, you know, it takes a very specific skill to be a very good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5180.8s	5180.8	 founder. You need a level of intellectual curiosity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5185.0s	5185.0	 You need some, at some moments to listen, but at some moments to know just when to do what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5188.8s	5188.8	 you feel is right. But it takes a lot of skill to be an investor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5192.5s	5192.5	 And I think we've glossed over how hard that business is as well, because the reality is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5196.8s	5196.8	 if Michael Moritz were to tell you that you do it, you'd be hard pressed to not say yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5201.0s	5201.0	 Of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5201.6s	5201.6	 If he really told you to do that, you would do it because, you know, these are sort of the big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5206.5s	5206.5	 names in our industry. But the reality is the fact that it's not happening also speaks to the fact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5211.2s	5211.2	 that there's probably, there shouldn't be a quarter trillion dollars of funds that are probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5215.9s	5215.9	 stranded in the hands of really inexperienced allocators who are going to light it on fire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5222.4s	5222.4	 for the most part. And they're not going to have the courage to sort of lead these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5226.9s	5226.9	 See what happens. All you need is all you need is one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5230.6s	5230.6	 Everybody should think about what I don't know how you phrase it to founder sacks, but I say to them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5235.8s	5235.8	 when I invest in their companies, listen, when everything's get really hard, and you have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5239.2s	5239.2	 conversation that is the hardest conversation that's making you the most nervous, that's making you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5242.8s	5242.8	 stare at the ceiling and grind your fucking teeth to your gums. I want you to just call me. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5247.8s	5247.8	 can tell you like, you know, not speaking out of turn here, but you know, Travis called me once or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5251.5s	5251.5	 twice on a Saturday and said, Hey, we're struggling with X. What do you think? And Travis knows how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5256.3s	5256.3	 to run a business 1000 times better than me. But being a sounding board and giving your founders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5260.6s	5260.6	 permission to come to you when things are fucked up is critically important as an investor and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5265.3s	5265.3	 being able to have an intellectually honest to your point, your mouth discussion about the hardest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5269.5s	5269.5	 issues is really what the job is in my mind. What is going to send this company off the rails?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5275.4s	5275.4	 What is the big fear you have? And let's just put it on the table. And let's as Travis would say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5280.4s	5280.4	 let's have a jam session, let's jam on that, until we solve the problem. So if you're suffering out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5285.2s	5285.2	 there, you're scared, you know, it's got to be an investor in your group who will have a candid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5289.2s	5289.2	 discussion fight to give a punch list of things. If I was a founder right now, here are the things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5293.9s	5293.9	 that I would do is I would sit down and really look at your growth and your burn and have an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5298.6s	5298.6	 honest conversation with your co founder or with one or two of your trusted board members. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5303.9s	5303.9	 really say what is the real valuation of this business today? And what could it actually be?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5308.3s	5308.3	 And if there's a big gap between that and where you've last raised money, the right thing to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5314.0s	5314.0	 is to think about in one bucket, resetting the valuation in a second bucket, making your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5319.8s	5319.8	 employees whole. And in a third bucket, managing your earn so that you extend your runway. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5325.3s	5325.3	 if you could do those three things, and take the hard medicine now, you will be much better off for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5331.0s	5331.0	 it. You'll be appreciated by your employees, and you'll have shown some real metal in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5338.1s	5338.1	 real crucible moment to use a Sequoia phrase. How do you guys think the market's going to settle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5342.3s	5342.3	 out? Do you have any predictions on the bottom? I will tell you a statistic. I think Michael
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5346.9s	5346.9	 Burry put this out yesterday. He did not. He deletes his tweets every day. Very interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5353.7s	5353.7	 character, by the way. But he pointed out how from top to bottom during the kind of 02 era,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5362.7s	5362.7	 01, 2000 era, and then during the 2009 era, you know, kind of those big drawdowns in the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5371.4s	5371.4	 He looked at companies like Microsoft, JP Morgan. I forgot which others but highlighted that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5378.4s	5378.4	 on average, it took six times their total shares outstanding for them to go from top to bottom,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5385.0s	5385.0	 meaning that the shares ultimately turned over 6x the total diluted shares out. And so far,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5392.0s	5392.0	 in those stocks, we've only seen half of the total shares outstanding turnover since peak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5397.4s	5397.4	 And he's been making this case for kind of a few days and a few weeks now, which is like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5401.4s	5401.4	 the dead cat bounce day, where the market's going to be tanking for quite a while. And these days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5406.3s	5406.3	 that are big updates, everyone's trying to call the bottom. He's like, No, this is the dead cat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5409.5s	5409.5	 bounce moment. And he's like, if you look at kind of the structural rotation that's necessary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5414.1s	5414.1	 for these markets to ultimately find their bottom, you know, we've got several multiples still to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5419.0s	5419.0	 with respect to volume that needs to trade before you find what the true market bottom is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5424.5s	5424.5	 So, you know, it was a really interesting kind of insight to this kind of statistical insight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5428.2s	5428.2	 that he pulled together and put on Twitter. I wanted to see if you guys kind of think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5432.0s	5432.0	 that might be the right way to think about it and how you react to, you know, these conversations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5435.8s	5435.8	 around where's the bottom going to be. Can I just pull up this one chart that kind of speaks to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5439.8s	5439.8	 So this is CPI inflation versus the Fed funds rate. So if you look at this, it goes all the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5446.2s	5446.2	 back to 1954. I shared it with you guys in the chat. The two have moved more or less in lockstep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5453.6s	5453.6	 with each other, which makes sense because the Fed raises the Fed funds rate in order to combat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5459.3s	5459.3	 inflation. So Fed funds and inflation sort of move in lockstep. If you look at what's happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5464.1s	5464.1	 over the past year, these two things have moved violently out of sync with each other. You have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5469.4s	5469.4	 inflation now going all the way up to 8%. Meanwhile, the Fed funds rates only down to like 1%. Even with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5477.0s	5477.0	 all the rate hikes and the talk of rate hikes that we've had, we're only at a 1% Fed funds rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5485.1s	5485.1	 Now, the expectation is it's going to go higher. The 10-year T-Ball is over 3%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5490.3s	5490.3	 But the point is the Fed is in a really tough spot here because it feels like we're going into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5494.4s	5494.4	 recession, which would normally mean you cut rates, but then you've got inflation demanding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5499.5s	5499.5	 that we jack up rates far more. I think this is the problem, and this is what's going to be very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5505.6s	5505.6	 tough about our current situation, is if we go into recession over the next six months, what does the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5509.8s	5509.8	 Fed do about that? They don't really have much dry powder here. In previous recessions like the GFC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5515.7s	5515.7	 and 08, interest rates were around 5%. When they saw us from to zero, that was some serious relief.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5523.5s	5523.5	 Here, you're at 1%. What do you do? You drop that to zero, and then, meanwhile, inflation is still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5528.0s	5528.0	 rampaging at 5%. This is what's so hard about it. Then look at this other chart, which is this came
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5533.9s	5533.9	 from a blog post called The Most Reckless Fed Ever. In this Most Reckless Fed Ever, they basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5541.7s	5541.7	 just took the Fed funds rate and subtracted inflation to get the real Fed funds rates,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5547.1s	5547.1	 the Fed's funds rate debt of inflation. What you could see here is that starting around 2018-19,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5555.0s	5555.0	 the real Fed funds rates started going negative and then very, very negative to the point now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5559.4s	5559.4	 where it's basically at negative 7%. Why is that? Because the Fed waited way too long to basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5567.0s	5567.0	 take away the punch bowl and start reacting to inflation. You had Powell say a year ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5572.5s	5572.5	 that inflation was transitory and then they didn't react to it until the end of the year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5576.8s	5576.8	 They should have stopped the QE right then and there and then gradually started raising rates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5581.6s	5581.6	 instead of these violent moves that we've had this year that are plunging the economy into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5586.0s	5586.0	 recession that have caused the stock market crash. Now, what did Powell just say a week or two ago?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5590.5s	5590.5	 He said he doesn't see a risk of recession on the horizon. It's like, what are you smoking? I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5596.3s	5596.3	 this is just like his inflation is transitory comment a year ago. You're wondering, do we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5600.8s	5600.8	 better data than the Fed chair does because from where we're sitting, we're seeing a stock market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5606.0s	5606.0	 crash, a panic and a recession and he doesn't even see it. It's like-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5610.0s	5610.0	 Denial is not just a river in Egypt. This is crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5613.2s	5613.2	 Look, I mean, we call it a crash but some people might just say that investors are violently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5618.4s	5618.4	 reacting to the shifting tides on capital availability. But I will tell you, I'll say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5623.9s	5623.9	 this one more time because I think it's so important and it's my prediction of the week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5630.8s	5630.8	 I really think we're going to run into a consumer credit bubble here. I do not think that consumers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5636.1s	5636.1	 are going to slow down their spending or change their lifestyle as quickly as investors are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5641.6s	5641.6	 changing their investing style. We have seen investors in public markets and private markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5646.4s	5646.4	 take massive corrective hits this week and last week and they're changing their behavior in some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5650.5s	5650.5	 of the stories we shared today. But consumers are taking on more credit. They're opening credit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5655.0s	5655.0	 cards. They're taking out bigger loans. Prices are going up 10% year over year for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5659.7s	5659.7	 And so the concern is if we actually do hit a recession and we don't see real wage growth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5664.2s	5664.2	 and the consumer credit bubble continues to grow, we're going to face a credit crisis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5668.8s	5668.8	 and call it nine months to a year where we're all going to wake up and be like, wait a second,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5674.3s	5674.3	 how are consumers going to be able to afford all this credit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5676.4s	5676.4	 Very simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5677.0s	5677.0	 And I don't know how you bridge that hole.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5678.9s	5678.9	 End of the great resignation, that whole concept of like fun employed and I'm going to flip NFTs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5683.6s	5683.6	 and I'm not going to go to work. That's out the window. So people who've been enjoying it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5688.9s	5688.9	 people are going to need jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5689.7s	5689.7	 So Freiburg's right that there are more shoes to drop here and I think consumer is one of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5693.6s	5693.6	 and maybe there's systemic risks in the system that haven't been flushed out yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5697.2s	5697.2	 And meanwhile, you've got a Fed chair in denial about what's happening and you've got a president
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5701.6s	5701.6	 of the United States who's more focused on what's happening in Ukraine than what's happening in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5706.0s	5706.0	 United States. We have Tweedledee and Tweedledum on this case. Biden and Powell are going to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5711.9s	5711.9	 down as the worst president and Fed chair of all time. No, it is like the anti-Reagan-Vulker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5718.5s	5718.5	 combination. I mean, they've caused this problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5720.7s	5720.7	 So first of all, this is all long. I don't know if I agree. It's a longer conversation. I got to run,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5725.0s	5725.0	 but like, you know, I think we all want to blame someone. We all want to blame someone. The reality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5730.6s	5730.6	 is there was a massive leveraging that happened going into 2008. We thought we were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5735.6s	5735.6	 de-levering and I don't think we've been de-levering since 2008. And all of a sudden,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5740.3s	5740.3	 the chicken's coming home to roost or whatever the term is. And we're all sort of waking up to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5744.1s	5744.1	 the fact that, wait a second, they flooded the system with 10 trillion of money in the last two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5748.4s	5748.4	 years. That's the cause. It's not. And more recently, consumers and all of us have got to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5753.1s	5753.1	 It's not from 14 years ago. It's not from 14 years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5755.1s	5755.1	 Austerity measures in work. Austerity measures in work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5758.0s	5758.0	 There's a long cycle here, but. Chema, go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5760.7s	5760.7	 If you look back through time, roughly, if you look at like the average mean P for the S&P 500,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5765.4s	5765.4	 it can go down to as low as 3000. It could. But I think the reality is there's a Fed put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5770.9s	5770.9	 somewhere in between here because, you know, if we see the credit markets really seize up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5776.0s	5776.0	 which we would if the equity markets continue to retrench, the Fed will be forced to step in with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5781.8s	5781.8	 liquidity and we back to where we were before. So, you know, I actually think we're probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5786.4s	5786.4	 close to a near bottom ish here, 3800 ish in the S&P 500. You're actually starting to see some of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5794.0s	5794.0	 these early green shoots of a market bottom. What are those? It's when the most heavily shorted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5800.2s	5800.2	 stocks start to rip up, you know, sort of the game stop, game stop like rallies. And you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5806.3s	5806.3	 seeing that actually today. So it's a, it's a really interesting day when the market is roughly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5810.9s	5810.9	 flat, slightly down, but some of these companies, you know, block percent square, five, six percent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5817.7s	5817.7	 our bad as a five percent even lift went up five percent. So this is the bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5822.6s	5822.6	 There was definitely some panic selling yesterday. There was so much panic selling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5826.5s	5826.5	 yesterday that the market's bouncing up from that. Look, the market is a leading indicator,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5830.8s	5830.8	 not a lagging indicator. And so it's it adjusts first and then the real economy adjusts after that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5837.1s	5837.1	 And the risk right now is the stock market is telling us something about where the real economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5841.1s	5841.1	 is headed. And the problem is that the Fed and the central government don't really have the tools to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5845.7s	5845.7	 fight the recession because interest rates are already so low. And, you know, Biden already spent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5850.8s	5850.8	 all the money. I mean, they broke the glass in case of emergency last year. They spent that last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5855.2s	5855.2	 two trillion dollars of emergency relief when Larry Summers told them they didn't need to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5860.8s	5860.8	 Remember that Larry Summers told me it would lead to inflation. Nobody I know. No one wants to listen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5865.6s	5865.6	 Larry Summers. He's like one of those guys you never want to admit is correct. But Larry Summers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5870.5s	5870.5	 was correct. The administration did not listen to him. Larry, who I know very well, and I've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5874.7s	5874.7	 heard who I love is like girly as well. He's generally right in the end. And so I would just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5879.8s	5879.8	 kind of Yeah, you know, he was right. I mean, we do need to get back to the Clinton, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5885.2s	5885.2	 moderate like balance the budget, stop spending some austerity measures, like we could only work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5890.4s	5890.4	 our way out of this. And I think what we're going to learn from this is the concept of free money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5894.2s	5894.2	 and printing money is not sustainable. And the concept of Americans not going to work is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5899.1s	5899.1	 going to make the economy that Americans want to live in. I know this sounds fucking crazy. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5904.8s	5904.8	 if you want to spend money and you want to enjoy life, you got to work you can't we can't have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5911.6s	5911.6	 this kind of labor participation. We can't have people flipping NFTs for living. That's not work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5916.8s	5916.8	 Yeah, you're right, Jason. You're right about that. I saw this thing where there's a there's a new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5922.5s	5922.5	 product implementation on Airbnb that allows you to kind of like, you know, search by campgrounds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5927.7s	5927.7	 or search by castles or search by vibe. It's vibe search. And and search by a vibe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5934.8s	5934.8	 It's a perfect encapsulation of this moment where there are folks who have all of this flexibility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5940.4s	5940.4	 they've never enjoyed before that their mindset, you know, especially if you're like a social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5944.9s	5944.9	 striver, like you can signal that you're different from everybody else by living this lifestyle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5950.1s	5950.1	 but that works in a in a world where there's lots of free money. And when that free money gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5954.6s	5954.6	 taken away. I'm not sure that you're renting castles to spend a week here in a week there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezOIBfZcwbQ&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=55&t=5959.6s	5959.6	 Well, I mean, we all want to talk about UBI. I think it's a very virtual signaling thing to do.
