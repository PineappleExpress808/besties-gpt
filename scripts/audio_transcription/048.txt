https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=226.0s	226.0	 Twitter survey where I asked Miami or Austin and Miami won by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=230.4s	230.4	 about 52%. Austin got about 48%. With over 10,000 votes, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=237.2s	237.2	 was pretty interesting. And do you have a preference yourself

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=243.1s	243.1	 place in Miami, but I'm checking out Austin to serve. Yeah, just

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=352.4s	352.4	 because of David Sachs comments. A new poll shows that 80% are

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=427.1s	427.1	 work out. But so I do a lot of that. I do a lot of work out. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=433.0s	433.0	 read a lot of that. And I have I mean, other than that, I just,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=440.0s	440.0	 I just read a lot and I and I think I remember a moderate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=442.8s	442.8	 amount. And so I cite that. And it's nothing really much more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=445.8s	445.8	 complicated than that. But that's it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=447.4s	447.4	 I think we call that a polymath that Tia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=452.5s	452.5	 the only difference would be you if he could stop going to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=456.9s	456.9	 club. And he lost that last 40% I will make an observation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=461.6s	461.6	 which I was actually talking to sacks about this, which is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=464.0s	464.0	 there's some people who are great at business and learn the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=468.0s	468.0	 tech because that part is necessary to put it together. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=471.4s	471.4	 there's some people who are fundamentally like scientists or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=474.0s	474.0	 academics, and then get into business in order to advance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=477.9s	477.9	 technology. And there's nothing wrong with the first group. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=480.6s	480.6	 I think that's totally, you know, fine and legitimate, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=483.3s	483.3	 business people first, and then they get in tech. I'm really part
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=486.4s	486.4	 of the second group, I think, where, you know, I'm fundamentally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=488.6s	488.6	 an academic at heart, you know, I spent almost the first three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=491.8s	491.8	 decades of my life meditating on mathematics, and just kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=496.9s	496.9	 got into tech relatively later in life than than many others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=499.6s	499.6	 All right. And you spent your career building companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=502.3s	502.3	 everybody remembers earn.com
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=506.4s	506.4	 actually doing extremely well at Coinbase Coinbase earn is on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=510.0s	510.0	 track for 100 million revenue. Actually, it's much more than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=513.3s	513.3	 that in terms of GMV, it's broken out separately in their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=517.0s	517.0	 not their s one, but their quarterly filing. So you can go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=519.2s	519.2	 and check me on that. And the other assets that we added after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=523.8s	523.8	 I joined Coinbase are more than 50% of Coinbase revenue again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=527.2s	527.2	 in their filings, and Coinbase custody and all of its assets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=531.7s	531.7	 come from Rosetta, which is something that we did there. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=534.6s	534.6	 we launched USDC when I was there. And that is whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=538.1s	538.1	 $100 million a day. So they got a lot of value out of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=542.3s	542.3	 acquisition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=543.4s	543.4	 Just just a CTO for a while of Coinbase, obviously, what was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=547.0s	547.0	 your take on Coinbase is lend product, the SEC coming in and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=552.0s	552.0	 saying, hey, pump the brakes, we want a bunch of information. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=556.6s	556.6	 then they've just Brian Armstrong and Coinbase announced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=560.2s	560.2	 that they're not going to do the lend product. What's your take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=562.3s	562.3	 on that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=562.7s	562.7	 So I don't speak for Coinbase anymore. Okay, I'm, you know, in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=566.8s	566.8	 my personal capacity. But I do think that this is sort of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=572.9s	572.9	 beginning of an era where we're going to be rolling back the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=578.6s	578.6	 alphabet soup that FDR put in place. That's to say, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=582.6s	582.6	 the SEC is not set up to go after millions of crypto holders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=589.6s	589.6	 and developers are set up to go after a Goldman and a Morgan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=593.2s	593.2	 you know, just like the FA is not set up to go after millions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=595.3s	595.3	 of drone developers to start to go after Boeing and Airbus. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=598.6s	598.6	 the FDA is not set up to go after millions of biohackers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=601.2s	601.2	 or have to go after, you know, Pfizer and Merck. So the entire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=604.3s	604.3	 20th century alphabet soup, that regulatory apparatus is meeting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=608.6s	608.6	 something that it's not really set up for. And it's going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=612.7s	612.7	 it's the problem is not the problem is not any one actor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=616.6s	616.6	 like Coinbase or Kraken or what have you their problem is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=620.1s	620.1	 technology has shifted. And they've got many more people to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=623.7s	623.7	 deal with and made those are individuals who are more risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=625.8s	625.8	 tolerant than companies. So, so I don't think they're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=628.5s	628.5	 be able to maintain the status quo of 100 years ago, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=632.0s	632.0	 statutes that they're citing, I think that's going to either get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=634.1s	634.1	 knocked down in court or going to be technologically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=635.9s	635.9	 invalidated, there's going to be sanctuary cities and states for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=638.5s	638.5	 crypto, or there's going to be international entities like what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=641.1s	641.1	 El Salvador is doing in Switzerland. So I don't believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=643.8s	643.8	 that that era is going to maintain but I think there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=647.4s	647.4	 going to be a big conflict over it. So we'll see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=649.6s	649.6	 How do you think it's different this time though, Balaji to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=653.6s	653.6	 like, crackdown because folks said the same thing going into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=659.2s	659.2	 kind of the Napster era when you know, everything was basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=662.3s	662.3	 peer to peer sharing of media files that were technically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=666.4s	666.4	 copyright. And there was, you know, some regulatory regime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=670.3s	670.3	 that you know, had oversight over that copyright. But then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=674.1s	674.1	 the DOJ got wrangled in and they went in and they made an example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=676.6s	676.6	 out of arresting a couple 100 kids, I think, and it basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=679.1s	679.1	 caused everyone to back away entirely from the market, similar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=681.9s	681.9	 to kind of what we may be seeing happening in China right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=684.8s	684.8	 But is it not possible that we see a similar sort of response
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=688.3s	688.3	 this time around where they kind of take this targeted, make an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=691.6s	691.6	 example approach to kind of share, scare people kind of out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=695.6s	695.6	 of the frenzy that's, that's, I think, driving a lot of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=699.4s	699.4	 onto these platforms rather than going after the platforms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=701.7s	701.7	 themselves. So kind of saying, look, this is this is a violation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=704.6s	704.6	 of security laws, you guys are getting prosecuted. Here's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=707.2s	707.2	 hundred examples and suddenly 80% of the attention kind of gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=711.8s	711.8	 vacuumed out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=713.1s	713.1	 Yeah, so I'd say a few things about that. First is, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=715.9s	715.9	 2021 is different from the year 2000 in the sense that China is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=719.7s	719.7	 an absolutely ruthless and very competent state. Whereas the US
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=725.9s	725.9	 government I would consider, you know, it's a difference between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=727.8s	727.8	 lawful evil and chaotic evil. You guys know that from Dungeons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=730.6s	730.6	 and Dragons, okay. So Chinese government is lawful evil. They
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=734.7s	734.7	 are very organized. And they plan ahead and when they push a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=738.9s	738.9	 button, they just execute like this whole of society, and they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=743.6s	743.6	 don't leave, you know, round corners or things left out. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=747.2s	747.2	 US government is today in 2021, not the 1950 US government, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=750.8s	750.8	 2020 US government is like this shambolic, chaotic mess that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=754.2s	754.2	 can't really do anything and is optimized for PR and yelling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=757.8s	757.8	 online. And that's a whole important topic. But to your so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=763.1s	763.1	 that's one thing where I think there's a difference in just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=765.3s	765.3	 state capacity. But in that's not to say that they're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=768.6s	768.6	 going to try with what they've got. The other thing is that so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=773.1s	773.1	 to your Napster point, there was thesis and antithesis, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=776.5s	776.5	 there was synthesis that's to say, you know, Napster led to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=779.8s	779.8	 Kazaa and Limewire and actually the Kazaa guys went and did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=783.0s	783.0	 Skype. So something legit came out of that. But the more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=785.7s	785.7	 important or more on point thing is it led to Spotify and iTunes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=789.4s	789.4	 The record companies were forced to the negotiating table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=792.8s	792.8	 There was a there was a waypoint there that's important, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=795.8s	795.8	 when that happened in Napster, we were in a company called Win
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=800.7s	800.7	 Amp, then it was part of AOL. The biggest architectural flaw of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=804.4s	804.4	 Napster was that Salama's ass. And and well, the biggest problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=807.5s	807.5	 with Napster was that it was it was not fundamentally peer to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=810.2s	810.2	 peer. And so there were these servers. And so, you know, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=813.2s	813.2	 the simple software architecture decision that somebody had to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=815.9s	815.9	 make was, okay, well, let's just make an entirely headless
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=820.2s	820.2	 product that basically is fundamentally peer to peer. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=823.1s	823.1	 that's what the Nutella source code was, we actually released
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=826.5s	826.5	 that on AOL servers, without them knowing, it took them a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=830.8s	830.8	 few hours to figure this out. They called us, we shut the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=833.6s	833.6	 whole thing down. But in those few hours, it was downloaded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=836.9s	836.9	 about five or 6000 times all this open source code that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=839.6s	839.6	 put out. That was the basis of Limewire, bear share. And that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=844.1s	844.1	 is what basically just decapitated the music industry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=847.4s	847.4	 And it was there that then the music industry realized we needed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=851.2s	851.2	 a contractual framework to operate with these folks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=854.1s	854.1	 because they'll just keep inventing technology that makes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=856.3s	856.3	 this impossible. And then that's what sort of that's what iTunes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=860.2s	860.2	 was able to do with the 99 cent store. That's what Spotify was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=864.8s	864.8	 able to do after that. But a lot of it started was because of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=868.5s	868.5	 what biology said earlier, which is a technologically, people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=871.2s	871.2	 just will continue to push the boundaries. And we did that in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=873.6s	873.6	 music. And I think that's a lot of why the industry looks the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=876.3s	876.3	 way it does today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=877.2s	877.2	 But ultimately, the the the premise kind of resolved back to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=881.1s	881.1	 centralized systems, right? I mean, like, think about, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=885.2s	885.2	 know, the the the Napster concept, it was really supposed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=888.5s	888.5	 to be true peer to peer file sharing, and it ended up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=890.7s	890.7	 becoming the iTunes store where everything sat on Apple servers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=893.9s	893.9	 And they ultimately, that's the reflexivity. Because like, what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=896.9s	896.9	 happens is all of these folks, you know, you're sitting at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=899.5s	899.5	 Warner Brothers, or Warner Music, or Universal Music Group,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=902.5s	902.5	 you're seeing an entire industry that was worth probably 20 or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=905.3s	905.3	 $30 billion just getting completely decimated. And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=908.8s	908.8	 there's this psychological thing that happens where first you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=911.0s	911.0	 want to shut everything down. But then because there's this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=913.6s	913.6	 other thing that is even more evil, and even worse and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=917.0s	917.0	 uncontrollable than the thing that you hated, then you actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=919.9s	919.9	 say, well, listen, my enemy's enemy is my friend. And so then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=922.4s	922.4	 you say, well, fine, let's find a few partners to work with. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=925.5s	925.5	 we can try to find a way of living with these technologies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=928.9s	928.9	 And that's going to repeat to your point biology. crypto is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=931.9s	931.9	 probably now where we're going to see it play out first,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=935.1s	935.1	 because that's probably the most important intersection of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=940.1s	940.1	 individuals desire and a regulatory framework that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=942.8s	942.8	 outdated, where the SEC has some extremely complicated questions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=947.1s	947.1	 it needs to answer, especially even after something today, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=950.0s	950.0	 if you're sitting inside, you know, the SEC, and all of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=953.0s	953.0	 sudden, you see that that China an entire country that basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=957.0s	957.0	 was where an enormous amount of this crypto activity started and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=960.9s	960.9	 originated and was happening, can completely turn something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=964.4s	964.4	 off. What is our position as a government and as a society? We
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=968.1s	968.1	 don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=968.7s	968.7	 Well, let me just fill everybody in for a second. For who don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=971.4s	971.4	 know what happens on the taping today, September 24. Chinese
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=975.0s	975.0	 government has announced that doing any transactions in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=979.0s	979.0	 cryptocurrency is now illegal holding it, apparently you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=982.3s	982.3	 still hold it. And this comes after Bitcoin servers being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=985.5s	985.5	 kicked out of the country. So yes, they've pushed the button.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=988.2s	988.2	 Go ahead, Balaji.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=989.0s	989.0	 To Friedberg, I would say, BitTorrent is what kept the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=992.8s	992.8	 record industry honest. And that kind of forced them to the table
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=996.0s	996.0	 of iTunes. So to Chimot's point, also, I wouldn't call it more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=998.7s	998.7	 evil, I call it more good. And BitTorrent also lurks out there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1002.3s	1002.3	 as kind of this, you know, peer to peer enforcer that it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1006.6s	1006.6	 check, exactly. And it's not gone. And in fact, it's a basis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1009.6s	1009.6	 for new technologies. And I think this is another flare up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1012.2s	1012.2	 The other thing is that with crypto, the upside, even though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1014.5s	1014.5	 the state wants to crack down on it harder, the upside is also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1017.1s	1017.1	 greater, and the global internet is bigger. And so I think the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1021.3s	1021.3	 rest of world meaning all the world besides the US and China
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1024.6s	1024.6	 is a huge player in what is to come. That's India, but it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1027.4s	1027.4	 also, you know, Brazil, it's every other country that's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1030.4s	1030.4	 the US or China. And so that's a new player on the stage. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1033.3s	1033.3	 then third to, to come out to your point about, yes, China
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1038.0s	1038.0	 banned crypto can be used to, well, you know, what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1040.2s	1040.2	 interesting is, people talk about China copying the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1044.1s	1044.1	 Nowadays, actually, in many ways, especially on a policy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1046.2s	1046.2	 front, the US is copying China without admitting it. But it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1049.6s	1049.6	 does so poorly. For example, the lockdown, okay, the Chinese
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1054.4s	1054.4	 lockdown, you know, was something where it wasn't just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1057.8s	1057.8	 sit in your rooms. It was something with like drones with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1061.1s	1061.1	 thermometers and central quarantine, where people were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1063.7s	1063.7	 taken from their families and centrally quarantined, and 1000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1066.8s	1066.8	 ultra intrusive measures that the population by and large
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1069.8s	1069.8	 complied with. I mean, forget about a vaccine mandate, we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1073.0s	1073.0	 talking about like, you can see all the videos and stuff from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1075.9s	1075.9	 from out of China, the government itself is published.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1077.7s	1077.7	 They didn't seem real at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1079.8s	1079.8	 They didn't seem real at first, right? Yeah. And so, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1082.4s	1082.4	 the thing is that for the US to follow that it's a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1085.2s	1085.2	 like as a mental image, imagine a life Chinese gymnast going and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1089.2s	1089.2	 doing this whole gymnastics routine, and then a big, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1091.7s	1091.7	 know, lumpy American following and not being able to do those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1095.0s	1095.0	 same moves, right? The Chinese government, you know, is, is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1098.3s	1098.3	 as I said, lawful evil, but they are set up to just snap this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1101.6s	1101.6	 snap that, do this, do that. The US government is absolutely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1105.1s	1105.1	 not and the US people are not whatever you do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1107.6s	1107.6	 Also, our system is a democracy, is it not like so you cannot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1110.8s	1110.8	 just do that, even if the government wanted to weld people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1113.4s	1113.4	 into their homes, we have a democratic state here, where we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1115.9s	1115.9	 have to discuss these things. And there's a legal framework to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1118.1s	1118.1	 it. So even in the 1950s, in 1940s 1930s, the US was still a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1123.0s	1123.0	 democracy, but it basically managed to exert a very strong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1127.2s	1127.2	 top down control on things. Today, we have something for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1132.6s	1132.6	 right, like, you know, under FDR, or in the 50s, a very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1135.4s	1135.4	 conformist society, which was able to kind of drive things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1138.5s	1138.5	 through, even though it's a democracy, it was something where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1141.6s	1141.6	 mass media was so centralized, that a relatively few relatively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1145.4s	1145.4	 small group of people could get consensus among themselves. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1148.9s	1148.9	 then what they print in the headlines, I mean, who's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1151.0s	1151.0	 to go and figure out the facts on their own, this gets into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1152.9s	1152.9	 the media topic later. So it's de facto centralized at the media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1156.2s	1156.2	 level, the information production and dissemination
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1158.5s	1158.5	 level. And then you kind of manufactured consent from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1161.1s	1161.1	 there. Today, it's you're combining that democratic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1164.0s	1164.0	 aspect, the legal aspect with a new information dissemination
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1167.3s	1167.3	 thing, which is de-stabilized, I think a lot of things. Sax,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1170.2s	1170.2	 what's your take?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1170.8s	1170.8	 Yeah, well, I'd love to get Balaji's take on an article that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1173.4s	1173.4	 came out this week in the Wall Street Journal, I think was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1175.9s	1175.9	 really important article came about four days ago, and it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1178.8s	1178.8	 entitled Xi Jinping aims to rein in Chinese capitalism and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1183.3s	1183.3	 Hu Tamow socialist vision. And the article describes how we've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1188.6s	1188.6	 all seen and talked about in this pod how they've been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1191.2s	1191.2	 cracking down on tech giants have been cutting down their tech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1195.0s	1195.0	 oligarchs down to size like Jack Ma, how he disappeared under
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1199.1s	1199.1	 house arrest. And, you know, and we've seen that, you know, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1202.6s	1202.6	 stopped the the anti IPO. But but this article went beyond
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1206.7s	1206.7	 those steps and really talked about Xi's ideological vision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1211.6s	1211.6	 And what it basically says is that what's going on here isn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1215.6s	1215.6	 just the CCP consolidating power, they actually want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1219.3s	1219.3	 bring the country back to socialism. And what they say is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1223.3s	1223.3	 that that within the CCP, or at least, Xi's view of it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1228.2s	1228.2	 capitalism was just something they did as an interim measure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1231.3s	1231.3	 to catch up to the West. But ultimately, they are very serious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1234.7s	1234.7	 about socialism. And, you know, reading this article, I had to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1238.4s	1238.4	 wonder, well, gee, did we just catch a lucky break here? In the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1242.7s	1242.7	 sense that look, they're abandoning or if they abandon the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1245.9s	1245.9	 thing they copied from us, which is market based capitalism, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1249.7s	1249.7	 use that to catch up, maybe this is the way that actually this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1253.5s	1253.5	 the thing that slows them down. And the thing that that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1256.6s	1256.6	 historically that it brought to mind is that if you go back into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1261.1s	1261.1	 the 1500s, and you compare Europe to China, China, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1266.2s	1266.2	 Chinese civilization was way ahead. I mean, it was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1269.2s	1269.2	 standard of living was way ahead, technologically, it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1272.0s	1272.0	 way ahead. Europe was a bunch of squalid, warring, tribal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1277.0s	1277.0	 nation states. And then what happened is a single Chinese
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1280.0s	1280.0	 Emperor banned the shipbuilding industry, any ship with more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1284.1s	1284.1	 than two masts was banned. And so exploration just stopped in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1290.0s	1290.0	 China, if they became very inward facing. Whereas the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1294.6s	1294.6	 European states explored and discovered and conquered the new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1298.6s	1298.6	 world, colonize the world, and that led to an explosion of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1303.0s	1303.0	 wealth and innovation. And as a result, Western Europe, and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1306.8s	1306.8	 it's sort of descended, the United States ended up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1309.5s	1309.5	 essentially conquering and dominating the modern world. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1313.0s	1313.0	 so I guess, you know, to bring it back to my question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1314.7s	1314.7	 topology, is there a chance that what she is doing returning to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1318.5s	1318.5	 socialism? Could this be like the Chinese Emperor who banned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1322.9s	1322.9	 shipbuilding? Or am I reading way too much into the single
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1326.0s	1326.0	 Wall Street Journal story?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1327.1s	1327.1	 So my short answer on that is, I think it is, I think the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1333.0s	1333.0	 socialist thing is real, but I think it's better to call it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1335.8s	1335.8	 nationalist socialism, with the implications that has, whereas I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1340.8s	1340.8	 think the US is kind of going in the direction of what I've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1342.6s	1342.6	 called maybe socialist nationalism. You know, where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1346.5s	1346.5	 it's, it's like different emphases in terms of what is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1349.5s	1349.5	 prioritized, but you know, and I think in many ways, China is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1354.7s	1354.7	 like the new Nazi Germany woke America is like the new Soviet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1357.5s	1357.5	 Russia. And the decentralized center is going to be the new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1361.2s	1361.2	 America, I can elaborate on that. But basically, with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1364.4s	1364.4	 respect to this, one thing I try to do is I try to triangulate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1369.2s	1369.2	 lots of stories. So rather than for example, and nothing wrong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1372.7s	1372.7	 with a Wall Street Journal, you know, the piece like looking at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1375.4s	1375.4	 it. But for every WSJ piece you read, it's useful to get like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1379.8s	1379.8	 you know, what is CGTN or global time saying even if you discount
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1383.7s	1383.7	 it just to see what they're saying. And then you also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1385.7s	1385.7	 triangulate with let's say the Indian or Russian point of view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1389.8s	1389.8	 And by doing this, you I feel that it's better than just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1393.4s	1393.4	 reading 10 American articles. And, you know, especially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1397.0s	1397.0	 reading primary sources, like there's this good site called
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1399.0s	1399.0	 reading the Chinese dream, which actually translates primary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1401.8s	1401.8	 sources, and then you can kind of form your opinions from that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1405.1s	1405.1	 versus like, like a quote hot take, or I'm not saying you are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1407.8s	1407.8	 I'm just saying that that's what I tried to do. So I think we've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1410.5s	1410.5	 really gotten China right here. I mean, I think that if you if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1413.3s	1413.3	 you look at what's happening, I think we've we've basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1416.8s	1416.8	 forecasted this orchestration of essentially the re vertical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1421.4s	1421.4	 integration of China. You know, we have China Inc, where the CEO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1425.4s	1425.4	 is Xi Jinping, and where there is a it's it's it's almost like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1431.0s	1431.0	 they've they've changed the game, where what they are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1433.8s	1433.8	 playing essentially is like settlers of Catan or something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1436.8s	1436.8	 where the goal is just to hoard resources. And I think that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1440.0s	1440.0	 have enough critical resources for the world and the clever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1442.7s	1442.7	 part of what they did was the last 20 or 30 years, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1446.6s	1446.6	 leveraged the world to essentially finance their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1449.8s	1449.8	 ability to then have a stranglehold hold on these critical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1455.1s	1455.1	 resources, whether it's ships, or whether it's rare earths or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1458.1s	1458.1	 other materials, they leveled up. And I think that was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1460.8s	1460.8	 genius. Yeah, well, they leveled up, they leveled up on our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1463.9s	1463.9	 capital. Yeah. And now that all that infrastructure is there, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1466.8s	1466.8	 now that we are addicted to the drug, they can then change the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1469.6s	1469.6	 rules of our operating system. It was a brilliant move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1473.2s	1473.2	 They allowed entrepreneurs to believe that they could be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1475.3s	1475.3	 entrepreneurs, they allowed an entire society to basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1478.4s	1478.4	 level up. Why did nobody see this coming? Chamoff? Nobody saw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1482.4s	1482.4	 this coming. People were starting venture firms, taking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1486.2s	1486.2	 companies public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1487.6s	1487.6	 They did Belt and Road while we did nation building in Iraq and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1491.0s	1491.0	 Afghanistan. Right? I mean, what is Belt and Road Belt and Road is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1494.5s	1494.5	 their ability is they're creating ports and super
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1498.3s	1498.3	 highways to extract the resources that Chamath is talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1501.6s	1501.6	 about, and bringing them into the Chinese system. And what did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1504.6s	1504.6	 we spend our trillions on nation building in Afghanistan?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1507.8s	1507.8	 I mean, why didn't we see this coming? Everybody was looking at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1510.5s	1510.5	 China starting venture firms there. You know, embracing it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1518.0s	1518.0	 this coming.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1522.5s	1522.5	 Right? No, no, I'm talking about why didn't we see them cutting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1525.4s	1525.4	 the heads off?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1526.0s	1526.0	 The answer is spent because it was not about white people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1531.9s	1531.9	 China was in Sri Lanka. China was in Africa. These are not sexy,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1542.4s	1542.4	 couldn't give a fuck. Let's just be honest. Okay. And so that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1545.6s	1545.6	 why it didn't matter. Because you we thought we all thought

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1556.4s	1556.4	 They don't necessarily have the resources that matter. But what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1559.6s	1559.6	 did China do? They realized that those folks are the future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1563.8s	1563.8	 GDP, those folks are the future population pools, the young that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1567.9s	1567.9	 can actually do the hard work, and then they went and they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1570.1s	1570.1	 secured again. So not only did they change. So that's one thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1573.4s	1573.4	 hold on. So that's one thing, I think we entirely missed it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1576.4s	1576.4	 Because, as David said, the military industrial complex
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1579.6s	1579.6	 doesn't look at, you know, a developing nation and say, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1584.7s	1584.7	 want to be there. It looks at Afghanistan and says, we want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1587.2s	1587.2	 dominate it, because we can actually feed off of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1590.8s	1590.8	 domination. So that's one thing. The second thing is that I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1594.9s	1594.9	 that we misunderstood Xi Jinping's ambition. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1598.8s	1598.8	 that that's a reasonable mistake to have made. The first one is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1602.0s	1602.0	 an error of just complete stupidity. The second one is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1605.4s	1605.4	 something that I think it was legitimate to have missed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1607.3s	1607.3	 And to your point, Jamal, he they not only stole the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1609.6s	1609.6	 entrepreneurial playbook, but the colonizing other places and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1615.6s	1615.6	 other countries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1616.4s	1616.4	 We thought it was dumb. Let's all be honest, you know, 10 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1619.4s	1619.4	 ago, I know we did it. No, I would argue in a lot of cases,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1624.4s	1624.4	 we benefited. So China set up and bought like the largest pork

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1633.5s	1633.5	 you feed them soybeans? And where do those soybeans come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1636.1s	1636.1	 from? Largest soybean exporting market is the United States. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1640.1s	1640.1	 know, we had a tremendous customer in China, as they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1643.8s	1643.8	 expanded their consumption pattern through all of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1646.1s	1646.1	 investing they were doing worldwide, we were exporting

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1652.3s	1652.3	 equipment and soybean products. And there was an our knowledge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1656.2s	1656.2	 industry and there was a tremendous service model and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1658.3s	1658.3	 globalization really created call it a catch 22 for the United
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1662.4s	1662.4	 States, where you know, we were watching the rising tiger, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1667.0s	1667.0	 know, it fueled in part by this kind of distributed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1669.5s	1669.5	 entrepreneurism. But as that distributed entrepreneurism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1672.3s	1672.3	 creates, you know, obviously the social you think there is an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1674.6s	1674.6	 equal amount of dollars that went into Western developed

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1679.7s	1679.7	 but it's hard. Western nations couldn't give a shit about that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1682.1s	1682.1	 money is too hard to turn down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1683.6s	1683.6	 There's a mistake in our thinking with respect to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1685.7s	1685.7	 rest of the world that we've been making, we make over and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1687.9s	1687.9	 over again. And it was all kind of predicted by a historian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1692.4s	1692.4	 named Samuel Huntington at Harvard in the 1990s, he wrote a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1695.9s	1695.9	 book called called Clash of Civilizations. This this book was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1699.6s	1699.6	 written the same time that another famous book came out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1701.6s	1701.6	 called The End of History and the Last Man and what the common
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1704.4s	1704.4	 belief was in the 1990s in the US was that we had reached an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1708.7s	1708.7	 end of history where every country would become democratic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1711.7s	1711.7	 and capitalist, right? That was the end of history is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1713.9s	1713.9	 democratic capitalism. And we believe that the more we went
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1717.1s	1717.1	 all over the world spreading our ideals, it would hasten this day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1720.8s	1720.8	 where they'd all become democratic capitalists. What
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1723.1s	1723.1	 Huntington said is no, you know, cultures and civilizations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1726.7s	1726.7	 these go back 1000s of years, these are stubborn things. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1729.5s	1729.5	 what these other cultures really want is not westernization, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1733.4s	1733.4	 modernization. And what they're going to do is they're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1736.4s	1736.4	 modernize, they're going to learn from us as much as they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1738.4s	1738.4	 can about technology, they're going to assimilate and adapt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1742.4s	1742.4	 and take all of our technology, but they are not going to become
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1745.6s	1745.6	 like us, they're not going to westernize. And that is basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1748.3s	1748.3	 what's happened over the last 25 years. And so the Chinese have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1751.2s	1751.2	 caught up to us. And suddenly we realize, Whoa, wait a second,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1755.0s	1755.0	 they have not westernized, they are still their own unique
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1758.0s	1758.0	 civilization. They, they have they have basically the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1762.3s	1762.3	 equivalent of a modern day emperor. And, and they have no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1766.1s	1766.1	 interest in westernizing. And we're like, what have we done?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1768.6s	1768.6	 Because now we've allowed them to catch up from a technological
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1771.3s	1771.3	 standpoint.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1772.2s	1772.2	 Balaji, why do we, why do everybody in the West get this so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1775.0s	1775.0	 wrong?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1775.8s	1775.8	 Well, so a few things. One is political differences aren't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1779.6s	1779.6	 public in China, but they are real. So it's it's all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1783.5s	1783.5	 backroom stuff. And there was a real leadership shift from Dang
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1789.3s	1789.3	 and Jiang and Hu to Xi. You know, the Mao era was revolutionary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1794.2s	1794.2	 communists, the Dang, Jiang, Hu era was internationalist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1797.6s	1797.6	 capitalists, I think that was real. And the Xi era is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1800.4s	1800.4	 nationalist socialist. And it's just different, like Hu did not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1804.0s	1804.0	 fully control the military the way that Xi does. There's this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1807.6s	1807.6	 ad, you guys should watch the Chinese military ad. It's called
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1811.7s	1811.7	 like, we will all be here or something like that. And the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1815.1s	1815.1	 thing about it, it's not just that it's like, extremely well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1818.8s	1818.8	 coordinated military parade and set to be intimidating and so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1821.6s	1821.6	 on. It's that the whole thing clearly just falls up to one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1824.6s	1824.6	 guy Xi. It's not him riding in a car with the rest of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1827.6s	1827.6	 Communist Party flanking him as an oligarchy. It's just like one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1830.9s	1830.9	 guy, this 2 million person army folds up to him. That is a true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1834.1s	1834.1	 consolidation and roll up of power that he was able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1836.3s	1836.3	 accomplish among other things with tigers and flies going and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1839.5s	1839.5	 throwing Bojie Li in prison, you know, having generals, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1843.8s	1843.8	 know, thrown in prison for whether they were actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1846.3s	1846.3	 corrupt or whether they simply, you know, dissented or were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1849.6s	1849.6	 threats to power. Yeah, it's hard. It's hard to know from the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1852.7s	1852.7	 outside, you know, in one sense, because so many folks in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1855.5s	1855.5	 Chinese government were taking bribes is almost like an equity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1857.8s	1857.8	 stake in their province, you know, like coming up, they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1860.5s	1860.5	 like, Hey, you know, hey, grew. So you know, give me a cut. A lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1864.0s	1864.0	 of people were vulnerable. So he just consult he so it's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1867.6s	1867.6	 something you know, people will say, oh, you know, the Chinese
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1869.8s	1869.8	 plan for 100 years. They don't plan for 100 years. They had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1872.9s	1872.9	 this huge war in the 20th century to the nationalists and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1875.3s	1875.3	 communists, the ding, the ding transition, you know, his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1878.4s	1878.4	 triumph for the gang of four, that was not something Mao had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1880.4s	1880.4	 planned. They're human beings like everybody else. And they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1882.6s	1882.6	 had a real leadership transition after three hours of continuity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1886.1s	1886.1	 Then this is what I think this is the key point you're making,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1889.0s	1889.0	 which is, I think the reason that this actually flipped and we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1892.2s	1892.2	 didn't see it coming is because Xi Jinping decided, I want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1895.3s	1895.3	 have complete control over the country, these other people are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1897.4s	1897.4	 getting too powerful. And we're actually reading into this that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1900.0s	1900.0	 there's some crazy plan. It just could be a crazy man, not a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1903.2s	1903.2	 crazy plan. I really disagree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1905.6s	1905.6	 Why explain? I mean, he just decided, he just decided to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1909.1s	1909.1	 basically take away every entrepreneurs company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1912.5s	1912.5	 They were not trying to do they were doing all of this stuff in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1915.5s	1915.5	 plain sight. Okay, as an example, you know, we view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1918.5s	1918.5	 Sierra Leone as a place where we make commercials about or we try
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1922.5s	1922.5	 to fundraise for or we send USAID. They view Sierra Leone as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1926.8s	1926.8	 a place where there's critical resources that are dependent on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1930.3s	1930.3	 that the future of the world depends on and so they will go,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1933.1s	1933.1	 they will modernize, they will invest and they will then own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1935.5s	1935.5	 those critical resources. View, we view Chile as a random
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1939.4s	1939.4	 country in South America that abuts, you know, Peru and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1942.1s	1942.1	 Argentina, they view Chile as a place where you where there is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1945.8s	1945.8	 the largest sources of lithium that we need for battery
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1948.1s	1948.1	 production in the future. They were doing this for decades
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1951.9s	1951.9	 right in front of us. And the reason we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1954.7s	1954.7	 didn't cutting of capitalism off on a second question, the reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1958.2s	1958.2	 we didn't pay attention is because none of those countries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1960.6s	1960.6	 mean anything to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1961.7s	1961.7	 Okay, so I agree with Shamath. And the thing is, so I'd argue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1965.3s	1965.3	 that the blindness actually comes from both ends of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1967.4s	1967.4	 political spectrum. Like on the conservative end. Oh, these are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1970.1s	1970.1	 shithole countries, basically, you know, you can believe that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1972.3s	1972.3	 if you want. But, you know, it's something where, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1977.7s	1977.7	 COVID was only taken seriously once it was hitting Italy and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1980.7s	1980.7	 France, like China was still considered like a third world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1982.9s	1982.9	 country. But it actually also comes from the liberal side in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1986.9s	1986.9	 a different look, like it's a slightly masked, but it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1989.7s	1989.7	 condescension of not the military industrial complex,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1992.3s	1992.3	 but the nonprofit NGO, you know, complex like, oh, the white
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=1997.1s	1997.1	 savior with the NGOs, you know, coming in and, you know, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2000.7s	2000.7	 know, pat them on the head kind of thing. They're not not a big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2003.0s	2003.0	 deal. And the thing about this is like the one thing I think is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2008.3s	2008.3	 a huge thing for our diplomatic corps today is making any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2011.3s	2011.3	 generalization about another culture, which says that they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2015.0s	2015.0	 not completely good, or that they have some aspect to them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2019.0s	2019.0	 that doesn't match exactly to the US, you can be called a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2021.8s	2021.8	 racist for doing that. And so this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2025.5s	2025.5	 Islam. If you criticize Saudi Arabia for throwing gay people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2028.6s	2028.6	 off of buildings, you are not respecting the religious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2031.5s	2031.5	 say that Balaji just gave the most precise delineation that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2034.2s	2034.2	 I've had. So I let me just repackage what you said, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2036.6s	2036.6	 it resonated with me. Western philosophy tends to view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2040.3s	2040.3	 countries in three buckets. Bucket number one are countries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2044.1s	2044.1	 like us, right? Those are the other Western countries, the G8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2047.1s	2047.1	 countries, they feel like we're aligned. And then what happens is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2050.5s	2050.5	 you get this weird thing where then you move into like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2053.2s	2053.2	 countries where you basically either deal with it with woke
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2057.6s	2057.6	 ism, right? Oh, let me go pat them on the head. Let me go try
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2060.8s	2060.8	 to save them because it makes me feel better. Or you deal with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2063.8s	2063.8	 them as neocons, where it's just like, let me go dominate them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2066.5s	2066.5	 and take them to war. And literally, you can take all 180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2069.7s	2069.7	 odd countries in the world and effectively sort them into those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2072.1s	2072.1	 three things. And that I think is the problem with, with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2075.4s	2075.4	 Americas view of what we're doing. And so what David said is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2079.2s	2079.2	 really true, which is that while we were doing this, we had neocon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2083.6s	2083.6	 war, woke ism, or you're our buddy, because you're like us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2087.9s	2087.9	 the entire world reordered itself with completely different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2091.7s	2091.7	 incentives. And they did it right in front of us. And now we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2094.8s	2094.8	 wake up to realize, oh, my gosh, that was an enormous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2097.4s	2097.4	 miscalculation that we just did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2098.9s	2098.9	 Yeah. So, you know, if you look at kind of the history of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2102.4s	2102.4	 West's interaction with the rest of the world, and let's talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2105.5s	2105.5	 about colonialism, and whether whether you're talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2108.2s	2108.2	 colonialism over the last few 100 years, or even you talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2110.7s	2110.7	 about a microcosm like Afghanistan, over the last 20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2113.5s	2113.5	 years, I would argue that there's three phases to the West
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2116.5s	2116.5	 interaction with these other cultures. Phase one is sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2119.8s	2119.8	 domination, right? Like Jamath was saying, phase two is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2123.7s	2123.7	 assimilation, where the the culture that's been dominated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2128.3s	2128.3	 realizes that they're behind and they want to catch up. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2131.6s	2131.6	 so there's a process of Americanization, Romanization. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2135.9s	2135.9	 what they're doing is they are learning from us and taking our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2138.7s	2138.7	 technology and it lulls us into a false sense of security that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2142.9s	2142.9	 we think they're becoming Americanized or becoming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2145.6s	2145.6	 Westernized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2146.3s	2146.3	 Right. It's not alignment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2147.7s	2147.7	 It's just they're trying to catch up. Then the third phase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2150.5s	2150.5	 is reassertion, where the the dominated country culture, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2155.7s	2155.7	 know, what have you, reasserts its traditional culture and its
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2159.6s	2159.6	 traditional views, because they've modernized, but without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2163.5s	2163.5	 becoming truly becoming Americanized or Westernized. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2166.5s	2166.5	 we are caught off guard by that. And we don't really realize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2169.5s	2169.5	 that they never really wanted our culture. They just wanted to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2173.0s	2173.0	 throw off, you know, American domination or Western
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2176.6s	2176.6	 domination. And so what they've actually done is use this period
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2181.3s	2181.3	 to, to basically assimilate and catch up. And the reality is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2185.5s	2185.5	 like in Afghanistan, they don't have to fully assimilate all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2189.3s	2189.3	 our technology, they don't have to become as strong as us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2192.4s	2192.4	 because we are in their land, they just have to become strong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2196.3s	2196.3	 enough to basically achieve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2199.2s	2199.2	 upgrade their systems, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2200.6s	2200.6	 They just have to achieve a defensive superiority. It's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2203.0s	2203.0	 an offensive capability. So it's much easier for them to catch up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2206.8s	2206.8	 than we think. And we are always caught off guard by this dynamic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2210.1s	2210.1	 and it repeats itself over and over again. And what you've seen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2213.0s	2213.0	 within in China is, you know, 3040 years ago, you had the great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2217.4s	2217.4	 economic reformer Deng Xiaoping, he laid out what they had to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2220.8s	2220.8	 He said, he said, abide your time and hide your strength, hide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2225.6s	2225.6	 your strength under a bushel. That was the great motto by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2228.9s	2228.9	 Deng Xiaoping. He set that policy for 30 or 40 years, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2232.5s	2232.5	 embrace basically perestroika without glasnost, they reformed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2236.4s	2236.4	 their economic system, they copied us, but but not making
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2239.4s	2239.4	 Gorbachev's mistake of giving up any political control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2242.0s	2242.0	 whatsoever. And by 2012, they had largely caught up. And so I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2247.1s	2247.1	 would say that Xi was not an aberration, he was a reassertion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2251.1s	2251.1	 They had gotten to a point of strength where they were ready

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2259.1s	2259.1	 their ethno-nationalism. And that's the point we're at right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2261.6s	2261.6	 now. And once again, we've been played for fools and caught off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2264.3s	2264.3	 guard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2264.8s	2264.8	 Friedberg, but I mean, one of the signs one of the signs was his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2267.9s	2267.9	 corruption crackdown a few years ago, right? I mean, that was kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2271.1s	2271.1	 of step one where he took all these provincial managers and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2275.2s	2275.2	 kicked them out and put them in jail and started to, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2278.2s	2278.2	 clean things up internally, where there was clearly kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2282.0s	2282.0	 corrupt behavior underway. But you know, I'm a couple points
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2285.8s	2285.8	 back, I do think it's worth highlighting that, to some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2288.9s	2288.9	 degree, you can kind of try and diagnose his motivation or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2291.5s	2291.5	 diagnose the motivation as being, you know, rather not too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2295.5s	2295.5	 surprising and maybe not too nefarious in the kind of, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2297.9s	2297.9	 know, power grabbing sense, which I think we all kind of want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2300.3s	2300.3	 to bucket it as. But, you know, if there's a population like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2305.2s	2305.2	 we're seeing in the United States, where when you loosen the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2308.9s	2308.9	 screws on liberalism, and you know, you kind of allow more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2313.3s	2313.3	 freedom to operate and more kind of free market behavior, you see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2317.6s	2317.6	 tremendous progress. And as I think we've talked about in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2320.7s	2320.7	 past, tremendous progress always yields, you know, a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2324.6s	2324.6	 distribution of outcomes amongst the population, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2327.1s	2327.1	 everyone moves forward. Some people just move forward 10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2329.4s	2329.4	 times faster and farther. And it causes populist unrest, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2334.2s	2334.2	 And we've seen it in the United States. I mean, if AOC,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2337.5s	2337.5	 Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were elected to kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2340.1s	2340.1	 be the, you know, the triumvirate that ran the United
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2343.3s	2343.3	 States today, they would probably say, let's end all, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2346.0s	2346.0	 know, this capitalism that's creating all this wealth in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2348.3s	2348.3	 United States, and progress generally would slow down. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2352.2s	2352.2	 think that there's been inklings of that. Clearly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2354.3s	2354.3	 there's data to support the inklings of this in China, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2357.8s	2357.8	 indicates, you know what, the loosening of the screws has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2361.1s	2361.1	 allowed tremendous progress, but it's time to tighten the screws,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2364.2s	2364.2	 because populism and unrest is going to arise from kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2367.5s	2367.5	 perceived inequality, just like we're seeing in the United
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2371.1s	2371.1	 States. And, you know, I guarantee or I can't guarantee,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2374.8s	2374.8	 but I would assume that if you know, certain populist leaders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2377.8s	2377.8	 in the United States have the same level of authority that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2381.0s	2381.0	 Chinese leaders do, they would probably act in the same way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2383.8s	2383.8	 I think what we're going to see next is and I think we should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2386.2s	2386.2	 talk about what we think will happen next with China. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2388.9s	2388.9	 China is on the brink of having a revolution. If you look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2392.5s	2392.5	 what happened to the Uyghurs, obviously, you can't practice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2394.7s	2394.7	 religion there. Students in Hong Kong can't protest, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2397.9s	2397.9	 can't publish what you want. founders can't start companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2401.5s	2401.5	 Now you're not going to be able to play video games as much as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2404.1s	2404.1	 you want. You can't use social media. And today, you can't have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2407.6s	2407.6	 any control over your finance. If you squeeze people across this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2410.6s	2410.6	 many vectors this hard, this quickly, I think freeburgs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2414.5s	2414.5	 right, it could result in massive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2417.9s	2417.9	 China is not like a uniform people in a uniform culture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2421.3s	2421.3	 Of course. Yeah. But I mean, I'm just listed like seven or eight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2423.9s	2423.9	 things they're doing to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2425.0s	2425.0	 but there are many provinces, many cultures, many differences,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2428.8s	2428.8	 many differences of experience, by the way, I mean, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2431.2s	2431.2	 the rural population in China doesn't experience much of what I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2434.3s	2434.3	 think is driving industry and driving this inequality and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2436.8s	2436.8	 perceived inequality and the changes that are underway. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2440.1s	2440.1	 don't think that a revolution is generally supported unless you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2443.3s	2443.3	 have, you know, enough kind of concentrated swell across the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2446.9s	2446.9	 population. I don't know how you could see something like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2448.8s	2448.8	 happening in an as diverse a population as China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2451.4s	2451.4	 I support China's limits on social media use by children. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2455.2s	2455.2	 could I could use that here for my kids.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2457.9s	2457.9	 Clearly, sacks is letting his kids use whatever they want. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2460.3s	2460.3	 mean, we definitely need to have some of those over here. Balaji,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2463.1s	2463.1	 what do you what do you think is going to happen? Worst case,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2465.0s	2465.0	 best case for China in the next two decades?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2467.1s	2467.1	 Well, so one thought I wanted to give is basically that in some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2469.6s	2469.6	 ways, this is inevitable because China and India are 35% of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2473.7s	2473.7	 world, Asia was the center of the world. And one way of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2477.1s	2477.1	 thinking about it is that America and the West executed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2480.4s	2480.4	 extremely well over the last couple of centuries. And Asia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2484.0s	2484.0	 didn't with socialism and communism. And now that they've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2487.2s	2487.2	 actually got a better OS, it's not like the US really could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2490.9s	2490.9	 restrain them, you know. So in that sense, that's also part of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2494.9s	2494.9	 their internal narrative in a way. I mean, of course, Mao
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2497.9s	2497.9	 killed millions of people there, they screwed up their own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2499.8s	2499.8	 stuff. But their narrative is they were colonized by the West
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2502.7s	2502.7	 and the opium wars are patronized as copycats emasculated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2506.2s	2506.2	 on film for decades. They're like heads down in sweatshops,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2509.5s	2509.5	 they built plastic stuff, they took orders from all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2512.1s	2512.1	 overseas guys, and announced their time to stand up and take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2515.9s	2515.9	 back their rightful position in the world. And that's like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2518.6s	2518.6	 that's their narrative. And so it's important to not not agree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2523.3s	2523.3	 with it, but at least understand where it's coming from, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2526.9s	2526.9	 they want it more, I think. And so I disagree, Jason, with your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2532.2s	2532.2	 with your view that they're going to have a revolution. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2533.8s	2533.8	 think that's like, that's the kind of that's a Western mindset,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2536.9s	2536.9	 where, you know, Australia, for example, is having these COVID
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2540.3s	2540.3	 protests. In China, the harder the crackdown, the less more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2544.7s	2544.7	 crackdown, like, the easier it makes the next crackdown. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2548.2s	2548.2	 like, it's something where it's not gonna be an easy revolution,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2551.1s	2551.1	 that's for sure. But we saw protests, you saw Tiananmen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2553.0s	2553.0	 Square, you saw Hong Kong, and you're gonna see Taiwan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2555.7s	2555.7	 I think since that was 30 years ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2557.4s	2557.4	 it's still proof positive that if you squeeze people, they will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2560.9s	2560.9	 take to the streets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2563.6s	2563.6	 Life in China has accelerated, it's incredible pace over the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2566.9s	2566.9	 past 30 years, the average person in China is so much better off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2570.7s	2570.7	 than they were five years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2572.9s	2572.9	 years ago, revolutions don't come out of that amount of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2575.8s	2575.8	 progress, right? When when your life when you go from $4,000 a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2579.3s	2579.3	 year in average income to $20,000 a year in average income,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2582.6s	2582.6	 what happens if they don't have jobs in their recession?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2584.5s	2584.5	 The only time you revolt is because of economics. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2587.8s	2587.8	 what I just said. So what happens if there's a if they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2590.8s	2590.8	 have a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2595.1s	2595.1	 seeing an incredible benefit and what that reverses? What if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2598.0s	2598.0	 that reverses? Would you see a revolution then?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2600.2s	2600.2	 Well, Jake, I mean, look, I think I think we it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2602.5s	2602.5	 topology point about this is like a Western mindset. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2605.5s	2605.5	 think about the Arab Spring. We saw all those revolutions with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2608.9s	2608.9	 the Arab Spring. And we thought, oh, look, they're they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2611.8s	2611.8	 finally throwing off the yoke of oppression. And now they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2614.3s	2614.3	 going to set up democratic states. And what did we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2616.5s	2616.5	 actually get? We actually got religious fundamentalism, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2620.3s	2620.3	 Like we didn't get what we thought. And I think this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2623.4s	2623.4	 happens over and over again, is that is that, you know, we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2627.3s	2627.3	 trying to superimpose our mindset on them. You know, we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2631.0s	2631.0	 thinking like, frankly, a Davos man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2633.5s	2633.5	 Yeah, no, I'm thinking like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2634.7s	2634.7	 people want security, by the way, and security, security can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2637.4s	2637.4	 come in a lot of different forms. And religious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2639.5s	2639.5	 fundamentalism is one of them. And, you know, the the way that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2642.9s	2642.9	 we see kind of government operating China may seem foreign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2645.4s	2645.4	 and uncomfortable to us, but it provides enough security to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2647.7s	2647.7	 people to know they're going to have housing, shelter, food,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2650.7s	2650.7	 medicine, and be able to do the things that they want to do to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2653.4s	2653.4	 some extent in some limit. You know, it's it's not necessarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2657.1s	2657.1	 an equation that says all humans that don't live like Americans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2659.9s	2659.9	 are going to be unhappy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2660.7s	2660.7	 Yeah, last thing I'll just say is basically, I think the idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2663.4s	2663.4	 that China will collapse from internal revolution, or, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2667.2s	2667.2	 know, the US military is like really strong relative to China,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2669.8s	2669.8	 I think are both actually forms of wishful thinking. With that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2672.2s	2672.2	 said, I do believe that we need a strategy for China on a global
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2674.8s	2674.8	 scale, and think the future is a centralized East and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2677.4s	2677.4	 decentralized West. And but but I don't think it's going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2681.1s	2681.1	 just, hey, Deus ex machina is gonna gonna solve this problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2685.8s	2685.8	 No, I don't think the revolution is going to necessarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2687.7s	2687.7	 overturn China. I think you're going to see revolutionary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2689.7s	2689.7	 moments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2690.6s	2690.6	 Well, so just to say one thing in your defense, J Cal, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2694.5s	2694.5	 everyone's kind of beating up on you is I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2696.6s	2696.6	 was beating up by the way, just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2698.6s	2698.6	 it's active defending J Cal, what's going on? I'm not saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2701.9s	2701.9	 it's a guarantee of revolution. But I think this is going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2704.3s	2704.3	 there's going to be some social unrest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2706.1s	2706.1	 Yeah, well, look, the one way in which I agree with J Cal is I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2709.6s	2709.6	 do think that freedom ultimately is the birthright of every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2713.5s	2713.5	 human, regardless of where you're born, you know, who you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2717.0s	2717.0	 are, what culture you are. But I think the thing that the United
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2719.8s	2719.8	 States has learned over the last 20 years is the road from here to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2723.8s	2723.8	 there is going to be much more complicated than we think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2726.4s	2726.4	 And longer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2727.0s	2727.0	 and longer and cultures are very stubborn things, and they're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2730.3s	2730.3	 going away anytime soon. And the transition is going to have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2734.5s	2734.5	 happen within those cultures. It's not something that we can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2737.4s	2737.4	 superimpose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2738.4s	2738.4	 By the way, I would I would also point out freedom is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2741.4s	2741.4	 birthright and the want of a people that at some point have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2744.5s	2744.5	 enough security to feel like they have that luxury. Up until
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2747.9s	2747.9	 that point, I think that you have to make the decision of does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2751.1s	2751.1	 security give me more than freedom. And in a lot of cases,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2754.5s	2754.5	 security coming with all the costs it comes with may give
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2757.6s	2757.6	 people more than absolute freedom. And that's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2760.3s	2760.3	 transitionary phase, I think, you know, a lot of people's go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2763.0s	2763.0	 through people's being civilizations and states and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2765.3s	2765.3	 whatnot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2766.5s	2766.5	 Anybody have a prediction of what's going to happen in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2768.6s	2768.6	 next 20 years? Or we'll move on to the next. I just can't believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2770.7s	2770.7	 sacks was empathetic to your point, J Cal. That was that was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2773.9s	2773.9	 great moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2774.5s	2774.5	 It's really insane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2777.1s	2777.1	 I have a few predictions. Yeah, I think actually, if you read,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2780.6s	2780.6	 you know, the kill chain or similar books, that's by I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2784.3s	2784.3	 Christian bros, it's good book, where basically is like, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2787.9s	2787.9	 know, US military has a perfect record in its war games with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2790.8s	2790.8	 China, China's won every round. And, you know, if you if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2795.6s	2795.6	 look at just the fact that with COVID US military basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2800.4s	2800.4	 suffered a military defeat in the sense that it had this whole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2802.5s	2802.5	 bio defense program, it's supposed to protect against
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2804.4s	2804.4	 biological weapons that didn't work. Afghanistan, huge defeat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2808.4s	2808.4	 $2 trillion. You have this AUKUS thing where it looks like France
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2812.3s	2812.3	 is now pulling off and you know, from from NATO or the EU is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2816.2s	2816.2	 doing their own thing. I think that China is and then China is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2821.4s	2821.4	 really already predominant in many ways in Asia. And the US
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2824.4s	2824.4	 just doesn't care about the area as much. I mean, who wants to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2828.1s	2828.1	 start another gigantic war over this? Certainly, I don't think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2830.6s	2830.6	 the people of America do. After after 20 years of forever war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2835.2s	2835.2	 And so and China really cares about Taiwan, they really care
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2837.4s	2837.4	 about their backyard. So whether that's a war or whether
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2840.9s	2840.9	 that's a referendum on Taiwan, or whether it's some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2843.8s	2843.8	 unpredictable event like COVID, I don't know. But I do think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2847.1s	2847.1	 that China does have some Monroe doctrine like thing that it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2850.9s	2850.9	 gets to within Asia, where basically it says, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2854.7s	2854.7	 just like the US said, hey, you know, we're running this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2856.5s	2856.5	 hemisphere, they're saying, hey, we're running this sector of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2859.7s	2859.7	 things, whether that's a military conflict, where the US
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2861.5s	2861.5	 decides to just withdraw, I don't know. And then I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2864.5s	2864.5	 what has to happen is, we have to figure out what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2867.5s	2867.5	 decentralized West looks like an asymmetric response to China,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2871.3s	2871.3	 because it's going to basically be the number one centralized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2874.3s	2874.3	 state in the world, you're not going to be able to combat it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2876.3s	2876.3	 head on militarily, it's just, you know, it's got like 10x
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2879.7s	2879.7	 growth in front of it, it's already a monster. Unless
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2882.9s	2882.9	 there's some assassination or revolution or something crazy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2885.4s	2885.4	 like that, that's hard to predict. If it manages what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2888.4s	2888.4	 it's got, it's got like, it's like Google 2010, it's got 10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2891.9s	2891.9	 years of that in front of it. And whether it's a Chinese
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2895.3s	2895.3	 decade or Chinese century, I think depends on whether we can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2898.2s	2898.2	 build the technologies to defend freedom, meaning like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2901.3s	2901.3	 encryption, meaning, you know, decentralized social networks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2905.0s	2905.0	 meaning these kinds of things. Because that's the only, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2908.6s	2908.6	 think kinds of tools that are they're going to help us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2910.6s	2910.6	 whether it's drones, whether it's other kinds of things,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2915.9s	2915.9	 going to just be a Deus Ex Machina.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2917.5s	2917.5	 I think I look, I think that's a great point to end on Jason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2919.9s	2919.9	 because there's other stuff we want to talk about. So what one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2922.4s	2922.4	 of the things that, you know, Balaji has commented on that I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2925.5s	2925.5	 give him, you know, a tremendous amount of credit for is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2928.7s	2928.7	 corporate is the idea of corporate journalism. In fact,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2931.9s	2931.9	 Balaji, you're the first person I heard that term from corporate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2934.6s	2934.6	 journalism, which is a recognition that all these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2937.2s	2937.2	 reporters actually are employees of companies, and they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2942.1s	2942.1	 have a company culture, and they often have they have owners,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2945.5s	2945.5	 the companies do, those owners often have an agenda. There's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2949.1s	2949.1	 often a dogma inside these corporations. And, and it really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2954.4s	2954.4	 got me to see journalism in a new light, because these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2959.0s	2959.0	 journalists portray themselves as the high priest of the truth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2962.7s	2962.7	 who are there to speak truth to power. And actually, they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2966.8s	2966.8	 really just kind of the lowest paid functionaries on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2970.1s	2970.1	 corporate totem pole. And, and, you know, in contradistinction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2975.5s	2975.5	 to what you've called citizen journalists, who are people who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2979.5s	2979.5	 are writing what they see as the truth in blogs or, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2984.2s	2984.2	 formats like this, where they are not getting paid for it, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2987.7s	2987.7	 know, we're doing it because we want to put forward what we know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2991.5s	2991.5	 to be the truth. And actually, I'd love to hear you speak to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2994.4s	2994.4	 that, because I think this is like one of the most powerful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2996.5s	2996.5	 ideas that I've heard you put forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=2998.5s	2998.5	 Sure. So, so much I can say about this. The first thing I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3001.1s	3001.1	 would do is I'd recommend a book that recently came out by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3003.8s	3003.8	 Ashley Rinsburg called The Grey Lady Winked. And the reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3007.5s	3007.5	 it's very important, and I'd put it up there, frankly, with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3009.6s	3009.6	 top five books I'd recommend, I know I've recommended other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3011.5s	3011.5	 books, top five books I recommend Grey Lady Winked, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3014.5s	3014.5	 goes back through the archives, you know, the New York Times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3017.5s	3017.5	 calls themselves the paper of record, they call themselves,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3020.6s	3020.6	 you know, the first draft of history, they've literally run
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3022.7s	3022.7	 billboards, calling themselves the truth. But it's just owned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3027.3s	3027.3	 by some random family in New York. And you know, this guy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3031.3s	3031.3	 Arthur Salzberger, who inherited it from his father's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3033.5s	3033.5	 father's father. And so you have this like, random rich white
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3037.8s	3037.8	 guy in New York who literally tries to determine what is true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3040.7s	3040.7	 for the entire world, his employees write something down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3042.7s	3042.7	 we're supposed to believe that this is true. And I simply just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3045.4s	3045.4	 don't believe that that model is operative anymore, because I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3048.2s	3048.2	 think truth is mathematical truth, it's cryptographic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3050.9s	3050.9	 truth, it's true that one can check for oneself, rather than,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3054.8s	3054.8	 you know, argument from authority, it's argument from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3056.9s	3056.9	 cryptography. And you know, one of the things with Bitcoin with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3059.7s	3059.7	 cryptocurrencies is given decentralized way of checking on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3062.4s	3062.4	 that. Now to the point about corporate media, it's there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3066.0s	3066.0	 they're literally corporations, these are publicly traded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3068.7s	3068.7	 companies with financial statements and quarterly, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3072.3s	3072.3	 know, reports and goals and revenue targets. And so once
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3076.1s	3076.1	 you, you know, kind of are on the inside of one of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3078.5s	3078.5	 operations, you realize that that hit piece, or what have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3082.7s	3082.7	 you is being graded in a spreadsheet for how many likes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3086.4s	3086.4	 and RTs it gets on Twitter. And if it gets more, they're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3089.9s	3089.9	 to do more pieces like that flood the zone with that. And if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3092.7s	3092.7	 it doesn't, then they're going to do less. And they're all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3094.5s	3094.5	 conscious of this. You know, for example, Nicholas Christoph
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3097.9s	3097.9	 wrote an article, I think it's like, it's the articles, no one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3100.9s	3100.9	 reads article, someone will read where you notice that his Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3103.8s	3103.8	 columns get something like 5x more views than his other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3106.8s	3106.8	 columns, it's like this huge ratio. And so at least some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3109.2s	3109.2	 folks there are privy to their to their page views. So and of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3112.3s	3112.3	 course, they're looking at their Twitter likes and RTs, even if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3114.7s	3114.7	 they those are not directly page views, they're certainly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3117.3s	3117.3	 correlated with pages on the article. So all these folks are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3121.3s	3121.3	 literally employees of for profit corporations that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3123.7s	3123.7	 trying to maximize their profits. But we believe them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3126.9s	3126.9	 when they mark themselves as the truth, like the NYT, or as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3129.7s	3129.7	 democracy itself, like the Washington Post, or fair and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3132.5s	3132.5	 balanced like Fox, these people equate themselves with like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3135.0s	3135.0	 truth, democracy and fairness, they weren't exactly around at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3137.9s	3137.9	 the founding. Okay, they weren't they weren't part of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3140.3s	3140.3	 Constitution in 1776, the post offices, but these media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3143.8s	3143.8	 corporations were started later on and have kind of glommed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3146.4s	3146.4	 themselves on and declare themselves like part of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3149.0s	3149.0	 establishment, you know, and and they are not. And the last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3153.3s	3153.3	 point, and I'll just, you know, give you guys, you know, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3156.4s	3156.4	 floor is, but we didn't go and say, Oh, Blackberry do better,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3162.7s	3162.7	 blockbuster do better, Barnes and Noble do better. We just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3166.1s	3166.1	 replace them disrupted them with better technological versions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3170.2s	3170.2	 And so the idea that oh, you know, New York Times do better,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3173.7s	3173.7	 that's completely outmoded way of thinking about it, we need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3177.0s	3177.0	 disrupt, we need to replace, we need to build better things, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3180.5s	3180.5	 need to have things that have like on chain fact checking that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3182.7s	3182.7	 have voices from overseas that have voices that are actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3185.5s	3185.5	 experts in their own fields, that are voices that are not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3188.1s	3188.1	 necessarily corrupted by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3189.4s	3189.4	 what you mean by on chain fact checking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3193.0s	3193.0	 Ah, so this is this is a very deep area. But fundamentally,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3199.2s	3199.2	 the breakthrough of Bitcoin was that an Israeli and a Palestinian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3204.3s	3204.3	 or a democrat and Republican or a Japanese person, a Chinese
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3207.3s	3207.3	 person, all agree on who has what Bitcoin on the Bitcoin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3211.0s	3211.0	 blockchain. It is essentially a way of in a low trust
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3214.7s	3214.7	 environment, but a high computation environment, you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3217.6s	3217.6	 use computation to establish mutually agreed upon facts. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3221.9s	3221.9	 these facts are who owns what million or billion of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3226.7s	3226.7	 roughly trillion dollars on the Bitcoin blockchain. And that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3229.2s	3229.2	 the kind of thing that's I mean, people will fight over a $10,000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3232.2s	3232.2	 shed, you know, when you can establish global truth over a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3236.2s	3236.2	 byte, which says, you know, do you have 20 or five or 10 BTC,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3241.9s	3241.9	 you can actually generalize that to establish global truth on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3245.3s	3245.3	 any other financial instrument. And that's tokens and that's,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3250.1s	3250.1	 you know, loans and derivatives. And that's a huge part of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3252.6s	3252.6	 economy. And then you can generalize it further to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3255.8s	3255.8	 establish other kinds of assertions. And that gets a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3258.6s	3258.6	 little bit further afield, but not just, you know, proof of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3261.0s	3261.0	 work and proof of stake, but things like proof of location,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3263.9s	3263.9	 or proof of identity. There's various other facts you can put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3267.1s	3267.1	 on there. So you start actually accumulating what I think of is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3269.1s	3269.1	 not the paper of record, but the ledger of record, a ledger of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3272.1s	3272.1	 all these facts that some of them are written by so called
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3275.4s	3275.4	 Crypto Oracle, some of them arise out of smart contracts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3277.5s	3277.5	 But this is what you refer to. And as a today model of what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3280.7s	3280.7	 that looks like, it's sort of like how when someone links a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3282.8s	3282.8	 tweet to prove that something happened, people link an on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3285.8s	3285.8	 chain record to prove that something happened. Concrete
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3288.0s	3288.0	 example, do you guys remember when Vitalik Buterin made that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3290.5s	3290.5	 large donation earlier this year? Yes. Okay, so you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3294.2s	3294.2	 nodding, you want to talk about that? Explain what happened?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3296.8s	3296.8	 I think that you basically tweeted out something that was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3298.9s	3298.9	 essentially trying to raise money to secure necessary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3304.1s	3304.1	 equipment and pharmaceutical supplies to India during a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3307.7s	3307.7	 pretty bad covid outbreak. And then I think you you decided
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3311.1s	3311.1	 that you were going to donate some money. And then Vitalik
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3312.9s	3312.9	 basically stepped up and actually gave quite a large sum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3315.6s	3315.6	 I'm not exactly sure the exact number of all that you have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3318.2s	3318.2	 So it was an enormous amount in illiquid terms of this meme
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3323.5s	3323.5	 coin, these Shibu coins. But the thing is that everybody when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3327.7s	3327.7	 they when they wanted to prove that this happened because it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3329.8s	3329.8	 so unbelievable, such a large amount of money was marked it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3332.4s	3332.4	 on the on the order of a billion when he gave it. Do you how they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3335.1s	3335.1	 proved that they didn't link a tweet, they linked a block
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3337.5s	3337.5	 explorer. Okay, like an on chain record that showed that this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3341.9s	3341.9	 debit and this credit happened. And the big thing about this is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3345.4s	3345.4	 you know, we take for granted when you link a tweet, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3348.4s	3348.4	 taking for granted that Twitter hasn't monkeyed with it. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3350.9s	3350.9	 guess what? Twitter monkeys a lot of tweets these days, a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3353.5s	3353.5	 of people get disappeared. And so it's not actually that good a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3356.6s	3356.6	 record of what happened anymore. This is deleted, this guy got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3359.8s	3359.8	 suspended, this, you know, like, even the Trump stuff, forget
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3362.9s	3362.9	 about like Trump himself, but that historical archive of what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3366.7s	3366.7	 happened, you can't link it anymore. It's link fraud. Just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3369.0s	3369.0	 from that, like, I know, it's one of the 1000 most important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3371.6s	3371.6	 things about it. But it's an important thing in the example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3373.8s	3373.8	 of, say, Taiwan, and China believing Taiwan is part of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3379.2s	3379.2	 one China concept, and Taiwan believes it is a country and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3384.9s	3384.9	 everybody in the world has a different vote on that. How does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3387.5s	3387.5	 the blockchain clarify? What is the fact about is China a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3390.9s	3390.9	 country? Or is it a province?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3392.3s	3392.3	 Very good question doesn't have to well, what it does is it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3394.9s	3394.9	 clarifies the facts about the metadata, who asserted that it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3399.1s	3399.1	 was a country and who asserted that it was a province, and what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3402.1s	3402.1	 time did they do so? And, you know, what money how much BTC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3406.3s	3406.3	 did they put behind that or what have you, so it doesn't give you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3409.3s	3409.3	 everything. But it does start to give you unambiguous like proof
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3413.2s	3413.2	 of who and proof of when and proof of what. And then from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3416.2s	3416.2	 that, at least, yeah, I mean, like the way the way I've kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3419.2s	3419.2	 of explained it to family members who've asked, because,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3421.8s	3421.8	 you know, the concept of a chain is difficult, I think, for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3424.5s	3424.5	 people to that aren't, you know, have don't have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3427.3s	3427.3	 background in computer science really grog is like, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3429.3s	3429.3	 everyone understands the concept of a database, you know, there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3431.7s	3431.7	 a bunch of data in there, except in this case, the data that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3434.9s	3434.9	 makes up the database is what's being verified by everyone. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3439.5s	3439.5	 it's distributed. So everyone has a copy of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3442.3s	3442.3	 I want to know what you guys think about this week in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3445.1s	3445.1	 Facebook dumpster fire. Let's move to something splashy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3447.5s	3447.5	 And can I just say one thing, there's a book Friedberg on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3449.7s	3449.7	 what you just mentioned, which is called the truth machine by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3452.5s	3452.5	 Casey and Vigna. And it gives a pop culture explanation of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3455.9s	3455.9	 ledger of record type concepts I just mentioned, which which I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3458.2s	3458.2	 don't think I don't think a lot of people grok yet biology to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3460.4s	3460.4	 your point. And I think, you know, we're skipping past it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3462.9s	3462.9	 But it's a really important point, which is historically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3465.2s	3465.2	 databases have sat on someone's servers. And whoever has those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3468.7s	3468.7	 servers decides what data goes in the database and how they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3471.2s	3471.2	 edited and what's allowed to come out of the database. So in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3473.6s	3473.6	 this notion, generally a database with information in it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3476.9s	3476.9	 can be held by lots of people who generally as a group kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3480.4s	3480.4	 vote and decide what's going to go into it. And that's, that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3482.9s	3482.9	 the power of decentralization and how it changes, you know, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3486.0s	3486.0	 information economy, which drives the world. And it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3489.3s	3489.3	 going to have a lot of implications, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3491.1s	3491.1	 Facebook's worst month ever continues. We talked last week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3495.3s	3495.3	 about Facebook. Having a leak internal leak called the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3499.8s	3499.8	 Facebook papers. This is a continuous leak to not only the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3504.7s	3504.7	 Wall Street Journal, but apparently members of Congress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3506.8s	3506.8	 are also getting it and the leaker,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3508.7s	3508.7	 and the SEC,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3509.9s	3509.9	 and the SEC and the leaker apparently works in the safety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3514.3s	3514.3	 group, according to a congressperson who has been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3517.9s	3517.9	 getting it and they are going to unclog themselves, and that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3521.7s	3521.7	 were leaking this out of frustration, that there is human
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3525.3s	3525.3	 trafficking, democracy issues, and obviously self harm in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3530.0s	3530.0	 girls using Instagram and, you know, this research, but that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3533.8s	3533.8	 not all. Facebook is admitting for the first time this week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3537.3s	3537.3	 that Apple's privacy updates are hurting their ad business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3539.9s	3539.9	 And I think the story you're referring to is that two groups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3543.8s	3543.8	 of Facebook shareholders are claiming that the company paid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3546.1s	3546.1	 billions of extra dollars to the FTC to spare Mark Zuckerberg

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3553.2s	3553.2	 liability in the Cambridge Analytica saga. From the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3557.5s	3557.5	 political Politico article quote, Zuckerberg, Sandberg and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3560.8s	3560.8	 other Facebook directors agreed to authorize a multi billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3563.7s	3563.7	 dollar settlement with the FTC as an express quid pro quo to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3567.0s	3567.0	 protect Zuckerberg from being named in the FTCs complaint,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3571.2s	3571.2	 made subject to personal liability or even required to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3574.0s	3574.0	 sit for a deposition. According to the article, the initial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3576.2s	3576.2	 penalty was 106 million, but the company agreed to pay 50 times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3580.8s	3580.8	 more 5 billion to have Zuck and Sandberg spared from depositions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3585.1s	3585.1	 and liability. Here is the money quote, the board has never

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3602.7s	3602.7	 I have one prediction. The Facebook whistleblower. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3610.8s	3610.8	 when you are a federal whistleblower, number one is you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3612.9s	3612.9	 get legal protection. But number two, which people don't talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3615.5s	3615.5	 about much is you actually get a large share of the fines that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3618.7s	3618.7	 are paid by the act of your whistle blowing. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3622.0s	3622.0	 there was a couple of SEC claims that I think were settled last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3625.4s	3625.4	 year, where the whistleblower got paid, I think, like $115
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3628.9s	3628.9	 odd million or something, and just an enormous amount of money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3631.7s	3631.7	 And the SEC has done a fabulous job and, you know, using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3634.5s	3634.5	 whistleblowers as a mechanism of getting after folks. And, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3637.4s	3637.4	 know, I think the SEC said they've collected almost a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3639.3s	3639.3	 billion dollars since this whistleblower program started
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3641.8s	3641.8	 that they've paid out or something just an enormous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3643.7s	3643.7	 amount. And I had this interesting observation, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3645.9s	3645.9	 is, this person leaked a bunch of stuff, or whistleblow to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3651.7s	3651.7	 Senate to Congress to the SEC, there probably will be an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3656.0s	3656.0	 enormous fine. This person may actually make billions of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3660.9s	3660.9	 dollars, which will then make every other employee at Facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3664.2s	3664.2	 really angry about why they didn't leak it first, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3667.5s	3667.5	 all I guess all this stuff was sitting around. And apparently,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3670.9s	3670.9	 now they've shut it down, right? So that that entire data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3673.5s	3673.5	 repository around this whole topic is no longer freely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3676.4s	3676.4	 available for employees to prove. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3678.7s	3678.7	 what under a key tam thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3681.0s	3681.0	 Well, I think it was more like, like, I guess, like, all of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3683.7s	3683.7	 data was sitting inside of some Facebook, internal server.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3687.6s	3687.6	 No, I mean, I mean, what this this leaker makes money under
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3690.6s	3690.6	 like key tam. So the SEC will pay for information that results
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3696.4s	3696.4	 in a fine. And so they just recently announced that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3703.0s	3703.0	 paid out $114 million whistleblower payment, I was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3706.9s	3706.9	 highest ever. And that they this whistleblowers extraordinary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3711.7s	3711.7	 actions and high quality information prove crucial to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3716.1s	3716.1	 successful enforcement actions. I don't think they announced all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3719.2s	3719.2	 of these whistleblower payouts, they just pay them. So that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3723.6s	3723.6	 that's that's my one observation is I actually think this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3726.1s	3726.1	 whistleblower may make billions of dollars or more than any of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3729.0s	3729.0	 us made at Facebook, which I think is hilarious. But the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3732.3s	3732.3	 second thing, which is more important is that there was an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3735.5s	3735.5	 article in the Wall Street Journal about how sentiment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3738.3s	3738.3	 amongst Americans have now really meaningfully changed. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3742.1s	3742.1	 Jason, I don't know if you have those stats, but this is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3744.1s	3744.1	 plurality of Democrats and Republicans where it's like 80%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3748.1s	3748.1	 of anybody now basically says the government needs to check
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3751.5s	3751.5	 big tech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3752.7s	3752.7	 The Wall Street Journal published an article yesterday
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3755.1s	3755.1	 highlighting a new poll conducted for the future of tech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3757.6s	3757.6	 commission. It found that 80% of registered voters 83% damn 78%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3761.5s	3761.5	 Republicans agreed that the federal government quote, needs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3764.3s	3764.3	 to do everything it can to curb influence of big tech companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3766.6s	3766.6	 that have grown too powerful, and now use our data to reach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3769.5s	3769.5	 far into our lives findings are based on a survey of 2000 or so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3774.5s	3774.5	 registered voters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3775.6s	3775.6	 I think it's a really, really, really tough road that these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3778.9s	3778.9	 guys will have to navigate these next few years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3781.8s	3781.8	 Okay, can I offer some contrary views here? Yeah, please. So, on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3787.9s	3787.9	 you know, the whistleblower thing, you know, real whistle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3790.4s	3790.4	 blowers, in my view, are like Snowden or Sanjay, who are, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3795.2s	3795.2	 know, basically overseas and, or in prison for for telling what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3802.7s	3802.7	 the US government is doing. And the differences, I'd say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3805.5s	3805.5	 they're whistleblowing, if accepted and acted upon would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3809.8s	3809.8	 reduce the power of the US government. Whereas these, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3813.5s	3813.5	 know, kind of awards and so on, I think they they do distort
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3817.2s	3817.2	 incentives. It's not like they're giving a billion dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3819.5s	3819.5	 to Snowden for blowing the whistle on the NSA, the military
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3821.7s	3821.7	 industrial complex is not happy with that. But this money is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3825.7s	3825.7	 being given because government is currently mad at Facebook and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3828.9s	3828.9	 wants to do something that is like a quasi nationalization of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3831.8s	3831.8	 Facebook. Now, very similar to what happened in China, where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3835.9s	3835.9	 basically all the tech CEOs, they just do it much more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3838.1s	3838.1	 explicitly there. They just basically decapitate all them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3841.1s	3841.1	 say, okay, you're going, you know, spending time with your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3843.2s	3843.2	 family. In the US, it's done in this sort of denied way and so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3846.9s	3846.9	 on. But the US government getting more control over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3851.1s	3851.1	 Facebook is not a solution to Facebook's real problems. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3854.8s	3854.8	 just going to mean backdoor surveillance of everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3858.1s	3858.1	 Every single thing that was pushed back on every end to an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3861.2s	3861.2	 encryption thing that they implemented. Now, the Keystone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3864.5s	3864.5	 cops in the US government not they don't just surveil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3867.0s	3867.0	 everything, then their database gets leaked. And it's all on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3869.2s	3869.2	 internet, just like what happened under the SolarWinds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3871.7s	3871.7	 hack. So I'm not denying that there are, you know, like bad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3877.1s	3877.1	 things about Facebook, I actually think on net, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3879.3s	3879.3	 probably been more beneficial than many people say. But I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3883.3s	3883.3	 don't believe that the federal government is a solution to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3885.7s	3885.7	 those problems. I think the solution looks more like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3887.9s	3887.9	 decentralized social networking, where people have control of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3890.8s	3890.8	 their own data, not simply the US government quasi nationalizing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3894.1s	3894.1	 the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3894.8s	3894.8	 So you know, people bring up this decentralized social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3897.3s	3897.3	 network thing, and as if it is a better solution, I think you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3901.0s	3901.0	 believe it's a better solution. But I rarely hear anybody talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3904.7s	3904.7	 about well, if there's slander on a decentralized network, if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3907.2s	3907.2	 there's child pornography, if you are personal banking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3910.5s	3910.5	 information, or your, you know, you were personally hacked, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3913.5s	3913.5	 that information was put on a decentralized social network,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3916.5s	3916.5	 that cannot be reversed and stopped because it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3919.8s	3919.8	 decentralized, correct?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3921.9s	3921.9	 It depends. You know, the thing is, it's basically about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3924.7s	3924.7	 what does it depend, you just said that the blockchain couldn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3926.9s	3926.9	 be changed, and that all the facts were permanent. So why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3929.1s	3929.1	 does it depend now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3930.2s	3930.2	 Well, for something like child porn, for example, it's actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3933.8s	3933.8	 being used for that you're not going to find lots of people who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3936.5s	3936.5	 are running those nodes. It is it's something where edge cases
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3941.5s	3941.5	 are always used to attack something. There's a famous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3944.7s	3944.7	 cartoon which says, how do you want this wrapped, and it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3946.8s	3946.8	 called control of the internet, and it's either protect children
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3950.7s	3950.7	 or stop terrorists, right. And so when we talk about an edge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3954.7s	3954.7	 case like that, I mean, the CSAM stuff, child porn, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3957.9s	3957.9	 that was that's used by Apple to justify intrusion devices that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3961.1s	3961.1	 are scanning everybody's stuff. The I think the answer to a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3965.3s	3965.3	 of those things is, if you're doing something that's bad,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3970.1s	3970.1	 there's usually ways of going after it, that don't involve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3973.8s	3973.8	 this gigantic surveillance state that was after all only built in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3978.1s	3978.1	 the last 10 or 20 years, just normal police work that you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3980.5s	3980.5	 do. If they're actually like, you know, a bad guy, there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3983.7s	3983.7	 other forms of police work, you can get search warrants, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3986.7s	3986.7	 don't have this completely lawless thing, where you just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3989.9s	3989.9	 know, some guy in San Francisco hits a button and you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3991.9s	3991.9	 digitally executed. And so so, you know, it's not that there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3997.1s	3997.1	 isn't any possibility for rule of law, it just that it has to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=3999.7s	3999.7	 actually be exercised in this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4001.7s	4001.7	 I think we're on the same. I think we're a long way away from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4004.2s	4004.2	 decentralized social networking actually being the norm or being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4007.3s	4007.3	 a solution, Jason, I think we're at the step of actually figuring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4011.2s	4011.2	 out how much tolerance we have for probably specifically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4018.0s	4018.0	 Facebook and Google's specific business models. And it's those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4023.3s	4023.3	 business models that I think are coming up against privacy, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4027.7s	4027.7	 theoretically now and we'll figure this out maybe coming up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4030.4s	4030.4	 against mental health and you know, our child welfare policies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4034.0s	4034.0	 and what we all view about that. And those are fundamentally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4036.1s	4036.1	 governmental issues that they should adjudicate. And I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4040.6s	4040.6	 the more important thing that I take away from all of this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4043.3s	4043.3	 that we've all kind of let it probably get a little bit too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4048.2s	4048.2	 far. And I think now that there's a plurality, something's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4053.5s	4053.5	 going to happen. I don't think it's going to be right. I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4056.0s	4056.0	 think it's going to be just it's kind of like trying to perform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4058.1s	4058.1	 surgery with a rusty knife. There's going to be all kinds of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4060.9s	4060.9	 collateral damage specifically to how to police Facebook,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4063.9s	4063.9	 Twitter, social networks. I think it's just like social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4066.5s	4066.5	 media. I think we've jumped the shark at this point. And so and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4069.7s	4069.7	 I think folks would you see sexualization as the solution?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4072.7s	4072.7	 Like biology? I do think that that's the ultimate solution for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4076.5s	4076.5	 two key things. One is the most important thing that we all want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4080.8s	4080.8	 is to know what the actual economic relationship we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4083.5s	4083.5	 having with folks that we spend time with this. So when we spend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4086.6s	4086.6	 time with friends, that's friendship, there's no economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4089.7s	4089.7	 relationship there necessarily. Okay, when we spend time with a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4093.3s	4093.3	 lot of these applications, there is a subtle economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4096.2s	4096.2	 relationship that is actually hidden from us, which is that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4099.7s	4099.7	 believe we're getting value for free. But really, what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4102.1s	4102.1	 happening is we're giving back a bunch of information that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4104.5s	4104.5	 don't know. When you move to a world of decentralization, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4108.1s	4108.1	 shine a light on how people make money, and you allow us to vote.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4112.5s	4112.5	 Do I want it? Do I not that single feature will provide more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4116.9s	4116.9	 clarity for people than any of this other stuff will, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4120.5s	4120.5	 it'll force people to then step into an economic relationship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4125.0s	4125.0	 with these organizations. And I think that that's just fair,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4127.6s	4127.6	 because those folks should be allowed to make money. But we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4131.1s	4131.1	 should also be allowed to know what the consequences are, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4133.3s	4133.3	 then decide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4134.3s	4134.3	 David, you are a big proponent of freedom of speech. We saw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4138.1s	4138.1	 massive election interference, the Russians trying to use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4141.5s	4141.5	 social media to create division, other countries doing it to each
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4145.5s	4145.5	 other. It's not just the US and Russia, it's China and Russia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4147.9s	4147.9	 and everybody doing it to each other. Do you believe that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4151.7s	4151.7	 something like election interference and those bots would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4154.4s	4154.4	 be solved? Or it would get worse because of decentralization?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4157.7s	4157.7	 Are you a fan of decentralization? Or would you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4159.3s	4159.3	 rather have a centralized Facebook, Twitter and somebody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4162.2s	4162.2	 responsible like Zuckerberg or Jack to mitigate this for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4166.2s	4166.2	 democracies around the world?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4167.5s	4167.5	 Well, the problem that we have is we do have a problem of social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4172.8s	4172.8	 networks spreading lies and misinformation. However, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4177.9s	4177.9	 people who are in charge of of censoring those social networks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4182.5s	4182.5	 keep getting it wrong. So they allow disinformation to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4186.3s	4186.3	 spread by official channels, whether it's, you know, whether
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4192.4s	4192.4	 it's a corporate journalist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4194.6s	4194.6	 Are you going to say doctor? Are you going to say Dr. Fauci?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4198.0s	4198.0	 There's so many official channels that get things wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4200.7s	4200.7	 We talked last week about the Rolling Stone Ivermectin hoax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4204.8s	4204.8	 There's been absolutely no censorship of that manifestly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4208.6s	4208.6	 wrong story. There's no labeling of it. But then a subjective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4213.0s	4213.0	 opinion, like what Dave Portnoy posted about AOC attending the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4217.4s	4217.4	 Met Gala, which can't be factually wrong because it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4220.5s	4220.5	 just him, an opinion that gets fact checked and labeled. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4224.7s	4224.7	 bizarre. So the situation we have today is we're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4227.6s	4227.6	 preventing misinformation. We're just enforcing the cultural and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4231.4s	4231.4	 political biases of the people who have the power. And that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4234.9s	4234.9	 always a problem with censorship. And this is why I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4237.1s	4237.1	 agree with Justice Brandeis when he said that, you know, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4240.7s	4240.7	 sunlight is the best disinfectant. The answer to bad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4243.4s	4243.4	 speech is more speech. We need to have more free and open
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4247.7s	4247.7	 marketplaces of ideas. And that ultimately is how you prevent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4251.8s	4251.8	 disinformation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4252.8s	4252.8	 So decentralized Twitter, decentralized social networks, do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4255.7s	4255.7	 you think that is too much sunlight and too unruly? The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4258.7s	4258.7	 fact that things can be spread on there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4260.5s	4260.5	 And I'd like to see what those things look like when we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4262.8s	4262.8	 actually have them. I agree with Tramont that we're still some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4265.2s	4265.2	 ways off from that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4266.2s	4266.2	 Are we? I mean, but yeah, but can I say a few things? Yeah, go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4269.7s	4269.7	 ahead. Because I think we have these out there isn't master
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4271.7s	4271.7	 down out there and other services out there. And they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4274.1s	4274.1	 contending with these very issues. So it's happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4277.3s	4277.3	 Philosophy was not sorry, sorry, biology. I just say one thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4280.8s	4280.8	 before you go. But like this, this general philosophy is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4284.7s	4284.7	 novel. You know, the internet and the word are being called the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4288.7s	4288.7	 tech platforms were meant to be the response to the undue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4294.0s	4294.0	 influence that kind of Americans thought existed already in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4297.2s	4297.2	 media when they emerged in the late 90s. And you know, you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4300.9s	4300.9	 go back hundreds of years, like the state was meant to be the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4304.6s	4304.6	 response to the church. And, you know, the media was meant to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4308.4s	4308.4	 the response to the state and propaganda and then the tech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4311.3s	4311.3	 companies were meant to be the response to media. And you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4314.5s	4314.5	 now we're talking about decentralization kind of being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4316.9s	4316.9	 the response to tech and at some point, you know, information
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4319.6s	4319.6	 accrues in this kind of asymmetric way. And it becomes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4323.2s	4323.2	 called that undue influencer. And that I think ends up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4326.4s	4326.4	 becoming the recurring battle that we'll continue to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4329.3s	4329.3	 whether or not this notion of decentralized systems actually is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4333.0s	4333.0	 the endpoint or is just the next stepping stone in the evolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4336.9s	4336.9	 That is this constant kind of evolving cat and mouse game of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4340.2s	4340.2	 where does the information lie, who has control over it, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4342.8s	4342.8	 who's influencing people ends up kind of being I think, the big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4346.3s	4346.3	 narrative that we'll kind of realize over the next couple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4348.4s	4348.4	 decades. But I don't know biology if it becomes the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4351.1s	4351.1	 endpoint, right? I mean, this is this feels to me part of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4353.7s	4353.7	 longer form narrative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4355.1s	4355.1	 Yeah, so I think like lots of things look cyclic, if you look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4358.5s	4358.5	 at them on like this, if you look from the z axis is more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4361.3s	4361.3	 like a helix where you do make progress, even if it seems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4363.6s	4363.6	 you're going in a loop. And so I think, you know, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4368.3s	4368.3	 centralized, then you decentralize and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4370.4s	4370.4	 re-centralize. It's like the concept of unbundling and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4373.1s	4373.1	 bundling. You unbundle the CD into individual MP3s, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4376.7s	4376.7	 re-bundle into playlists, right? And so with decentralized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4379.9s	4379.9	 media, it's not purely every single node on their own, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4383.7s	4383.7	 think it's more like a million hubs and a billion spokes. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4387.7s	4387.7	 Jason, to your point, basically, most of those hubs are not going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4392.5s	4392.5	 to allow things that 99.99% of people think are bad, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4396.5s	4396.5	 CSAM, you know. As for other things like, you know, slander,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4400.1s	4400.1	 hack, talk, as you mentioned, the thing is current central
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4402.7s	4402.7	 arbiters will falsely accuse people of these things or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4405.4s	4405.4	 enforce them in political ways. It's, the centralization is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4409.0s	4409.0	 actually also not a solution to being abused, as Sachs points
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4411.8s	4411.8	 out. In fact, official disinformation early in COVID,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4415.3s	4415.3	 which, you know, I had to like, basically beat back with a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4418.1s	4418.1	 stick, fortunately, you know, got some of it out in time. But,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4420.8s	4420.8	 you know, people said the flu is more serious, the travel bans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4423.3s	4423.3	 were overreactions, that only Wuhan visitors were at risk,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4426.4s	4426.4	 that avoiding handshakes is paranoid, that the virus is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4428.7s	4428.7	 contained, tests are available, masks don't help. You know, all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4432.0s	4432.0	 that stuff, the Surgeon General himself, you know, tweeted out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4434.5s	4434.5	 you know, people don't wear masks, right? BuzzFeed, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4437.7s	4437.7	 know, NYT, all these guys got the story wrong, and then they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4439.9s	4439.9	 rewrote history to pretend that they didn't. So that, to me, is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4443.2s	4443.2	 a much greater danger when you have a single source of truth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4447.2s	4447.2	 that's false.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4448.5s	4448.5	 So we're picking the least bad solution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4451.3s	4451.3	 It's such a good point, because I'm old enough to remember when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4453.5s	4453.5	 Balaji was right about everything related to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4457.9s	4457.9	 beginning of COVID. And I'm old enough to remember when in April
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4460.8s	4460.8	 of last year, I wrote a piece in favor of masks, when the WHO and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4465.7s	4465.7	 the Surgeon General and all these official channels were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4467.7s	4467.7	 saying don't wear masks. So the problem is with these, with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4472.7s	4472.7	 official censorship, is that they keep getting it wrong. They
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4476.3s	4476.3	 keep getting it wrong. And I want to hold on, I want to bring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4478.7s	4478.7	 up one more quick point. Okay, Jason, you mentioned foreign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4482.3s	4482.3	 interference on Facebook, I would really encourage anybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4486.1s	4486.1	 who's concerned about that issue, to look up, you can go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4489.5s	4489.5	 look, you just Google the actual ads that were run by agents of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4495.0s	4495.0	 the FSB on Facebook during the 2016 election, you can actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4499.7s	4499.7	 see the ads they ran. I want to make two points about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4502.8s	4502.8	 Number one, the ads are ridiculous. They are, they are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4507.6s	4507.6	 sort of like an absurd, you know, foreigners perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4512.6s	4512.6	 And they're mean, they're mean, even with bad English. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4515.7s	4515.7	 Bad English. And it's, it's somebody who doesn't understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4518.6s	4518.6	 American culture's attempt to propagandize an American and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4522.7s	4522.7	 look at it, it's so ham handed. Let me give an example. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4525.9s	4525.9	 like, in one of them, they've got Jesus arm wrestling with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4530.2s	4530.2	 devil, saying, and it's Jesus saying that I support Trump, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4535.5s	4535.5	 the devil saying I support Hillary Clinton. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4537.6s	4537.6	 literally stuff like that. Okay, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4540.2s	4540.2	 utterly you'd see at a Trump rally,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4541.9s	4541.9	 it's utterly absurd. And nobody would ever be convinced by it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4545.9s	4545.9	 The second thing is, the second thing about it is that when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4550.6s	4550.6	 actually look at the number of impressions that were created by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4554.5s	4554.5	 the sum total of all of the so the so called disinformation of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4558.1s	4558.1	 all these ads, it is a fractionally small, if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4561.9s	4561.9	 intesible drop in the ocean, compared to the total number
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4565.0s	4565.0	 of impressions on Facebook. And so I'm not disputing the fact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4568.7s	4568.7	 that somebody in the basement somewhere in Moscow, perhaps was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4572.3s	4572.3	 running some sort of disinformation operation that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4578.0s	4578.0	 was running ads on Facebook, what I am saying is that when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4580.9s	4580.9	 you actually look at the effect, quantitatively and qualitatively,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4586.8s	4586.8	 you realize that that whole story was massively blown up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4590.6s	4590.6	 proportion in order to create an hysteria that then justify
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4594.5s	4594.5	 censorship, then justifies the empowerment by centralized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4598.5s	4598.5	 authorities to be able to regulate to be able to regulate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4601.7s	4601.7	 these social networks with the effect that the people in power
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4606.5s	4606.5	 end up censoring in ways that do not support the truth, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4610.8s	4610.8	 actually just reinforce their own power. That is what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4614.0s	4614.0	 disinformation story is really about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4616.1s	4616.1	 No, it's not what it's really about. Saks is that Russia wants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4619.4s	4619.4	 to pit people like you and me against each other, you're right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4622.5s	4622.5	 leaning on left leaning. And what they want to do is create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4624.8s	4624.8	 this moment where you and I are fighting over this instead of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4627.4s	4627.4	 fighting Russia. Russia has this as a strategy to demoralize us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4632.0s	4632.0	 And this is classic KGB technique. So battles back and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4636.5s	4636.5	 forth between Americans so we don't fight against
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4641.4s	4641.4	 I have no interest in fighting Russia per se. I'm not interested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4644.9s	4644.9	 in picking fights with foreign countries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4647.0s	4647.0	 You should want to fight against Russian interference. Yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4650.3s	4650.3	 I'm also not engaging in a fight with fellow Americans. I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4654.0s	4654.0	 attempting to depropagandize fellow Americans who've been led
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4658.5s	4658.5	 to believe that Russian interference in the election was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4662.0s	4662.0	 I'm not saying it didn't happen, but they've been led to believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4667.4s	4667.4	 that it was a greater threat than it actually was in order to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4673.0s	4673.0	 empower centralized authorities to gauge and censorship over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4676.0s	4676.0	 social network. So I'm trying to essentially deprogram an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4681.3s	4681.3	 enormous amount of programming that's taken place. I do not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4683.8s	4683.8	 consider that to be fighting with fellow Americans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4687.4s	4687.4	 Well, I mean, the point is you have the GOP recounting votes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4692.7s	4692.7	 even to this day, saying the election was stolen and then you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4695.5s	4695.5	 have on the left you have the democrats saying Russia won the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4698.8s	4698.8	 election for Trump in both cases, these are probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4700.9s	4700.9	 factually incorrect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4701.9s	4701.9	 In our last podcast, I cited the piece by Rich Lowry, which he is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4706.0s	4706.0	 the editor of National Review, speaking to conservatives saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4709.3s	4709.3	 that this whole stolen election myth. Yes, he called it a myth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4712.5s	4712.5	 is an albatross is it is nothing it will do nothing but backfire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4716.9s	4716.9	 on conservatives and republicans. I think there are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4719.0s	4719.0	 plenty of people who recognize that story to be what it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4721.9s	4721.9	 We're talking about something very different here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4723.6s	4723.6	 I kind of just want to pivot forward a little bit. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4725.5s	4725.5	 think it's a good question with biology on on the line. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4728.6s	4728.6	 yeah, let's let's use let's assume we move forward to this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4731.8s	4731.8	 decentralized model where there isn't a central media platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4736.3s	4736.3	 that adjudicates content and makes it available to to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4739.5s	4739.5	 users of the platform. So now in a decentralized world, take to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4742.7s	4742.7	 take YouTube, for example, YouTube has an application
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4745.6s	4745.6	 layer, which is the website we all use to access the videos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4748.5s	4748.5	 And there's a recommendation list that pops up. And then all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4751.3s	4751.3	 the media that that that exists on the YouTube platform sits on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4754.9s	4754.9	 some servers. And so the application is how I'm kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4757.6s	4757.6	 selecting what media to watch. But that's kind of being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4760.0s	4760.0	 projected to me because of the recommendations being made by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4763.1s	4763.1	 Google and the search function. If you guys remember, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4766.6s	4766.6	 know if you guys are old enough. But you know, in the early
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4769.7s	4769.7	 90s, we were all on gopher boards, and we were trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4772.1s	4772.1	 find information. And it was a total cluster, right? I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4774.4s	4774.4	 there's just like, no word, no way to kind of find what you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4777.3s	4777.3	 looking for. And so search became kind of the great unlock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4780.4s	4780.4	 right in use that and search became the great unlock for, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4783.7s	4783.7	 know, for accessing content on this distributed network that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4786.5s	4786.5	 call the internet. Now in the future, if all of the YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4790.0s	4790.0	 media is decentralized and sits on distributed servers and sits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4793.5s	4793.5	 on a chain or whatever, what is the application layer look like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4798.1s	4798.1	 biology? Because how do you end up giving users are ultimately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4801.6s	4801.6	 going to have to pick an application or pick a tool to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4804.9s	4804.9	 help them access media to help them access information. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4808.6s	4808.6	 there has to be to some degree, a search function or an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4810.9s	4810.9	 algorithmic function that creates the list of what content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4814.3s	4814.3	 to read, or they simply subscribing to nodes on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4817.2s	4817.2	 network. And that's kind of the future of decentralization,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4819.6s	4819.6	 where there's no longer a search or recommendation function, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4822.8s	4822.8	 there is simply a subscription function. I think that that to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4825.2s	4825.2	 me is kind of the big philosophical question, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4826.9s	4826.9	 from a user experience perspective, people want things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4829.7s	4829.7	 easy and simple. They want to have things recommended to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4832.3s	4832.3	 They want to have a bunch of a list of things and they click
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4834.1s	4834.1	 down the list and they're done. I'm not sure most people as we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4837.1s	4837.1	 saw in Web 2.0, when there were all these like, you know, make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4839.6s	4839.6	 your own website stuff and get RSS feeds and that all died
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4842.6s	4842.6	 because it was complicated and it was difficult and it wasn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4845.1s	4845.1	 great content for most people, they preferred having stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4847.2s	4847.2	 presented to them. So do we just end up with like 10 2030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4850.5s	4850.5	 subscription applications that create different algorithms and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4853.5s	4853.5	 different kind of access points for the content? Or are people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4857.1s	4857.1	 just living in a subscription universe in a decentralized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4859.4s	4859.4	 world when it comes to media?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4862.0s	4862.0	 It's a great question. So I think first, we have some vision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4866.5s	4866.5	 of what that world looks like already. Because if you think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4870.3s	4870.3	 about block explorers, and exchanges and wallets, and much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4875.0s	4875.0	 of the rest of the crypto ecosystem, they are all clients
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4879.1s	4879.1	 to the Bitcoin and Ethereum and other blockchains, right? So,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4884.9s	4884.9	 you know, I wrote this post called Yes, you may need a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4887.8s	4887.8	 blockchain, where, you know, people have said, Oh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4890.6s	4890.6	 blockchains are just slow databases. And that's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4893.3s	4893.3	 saying the early iPhone cameras just a poor camera. Yes, it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4896.5s	4896.5	 worse on one dimension, you know, image quality, but it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4900.0s	4900.0	 far better on other dimensions, namely the fact that it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4902.4s	4902.4	 ubiquitous, it was always with you, it was free, it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4904.4s	4904.4	 bundled, it was programmable, it was connected to a network and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4906.5s	4906.5	 so on. And so blockchains, yes, they have lower transaction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4910.8s	4910.8	 throughput, but they are 1000x or more on another dimension,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4914.4s	4914.4	 which is the number of simultaneous root users. That's to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4917.1s	4917.1	 say, it's a blockchain is a massively multiplayer database,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4920.4s	4920.4	 where every user is a root user. That's meaning everybody can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4923.5s	4923.5	 read the rows in the Bitcoin blockchain. And anybody who has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4926.9s	4926.9	 some Bitcoin can write a row that's a debit or credit to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4930.1s	4930.1	 someone else. Anybody with compute can mine blocks. Okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4934.1s	4934.1	 so it's open and permissionless. Similarly, for a decentralized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4938.2s	4938.2	 social network, it could operate in a similar way. Whereas,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4941.7s	4941.7	 let's say something like Twitter or PayPal, the root password is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4944.9s	4944.9	 not public, nobody can can access it. And so what this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4948.2s	4948.2	 leads to, to kind of continue your point is basically, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4951.1s	4951.1	 there's basically been three eras of the internet. The first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4954.0s	4954.0	 was P2P, which was, you know, peer to peer, right. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4957.9s	4957.9	 individual nodes are point to point communicating. And that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4960.9s	4960.9	 FTP. And it's, it was telnet before SSH.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4965.8s	4965.8	 Address. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4967.2s	4967.2	 Yeah, exactly. Right. And so the great thing about this is open
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4970.3s	4970.3	 source is peer to peer is fully programmable, you can see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4973.2s	4973.2	 everything, right? Then because of search, because of social,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4977.8s	4977.8	 because of the rise of the second era MVC model view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4980.8s	4980.8	 controller, essentially many protocols like social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4983.9s	4983.9	 networking or search are not efficient if every node is ping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4987.1s	4987.1	 every other node, you can't ping every other node with the index
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4989.3s	4989.3	 of the web, you can't ping every other node with Facebook's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4992.7s	4992.7	 entire social graph, when you know, you go and message
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4995.5s	4995.5	 somebody, you want a central hub with their photos and stuff. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=4998.5s	4998.5	 you can just send a few packets back and forth, right. And this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5002.5s	5002.5	 led to the, you know, the last 15 years, these gigantic hubs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5005.9s	5005.9	 last 20 years, these giant hubs, search and social and messaging,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5009.2s	5009.2	 two side of marketplaces, hub and smoke architecture. And these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5012.5s	5012.5	 hubs have global state and they're highly monetizable, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5015.1s	5015.1	 can make billions of dollars off them as many of our friends
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5018.5s	5018.5	 have, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5019.2s	5019.2	 By the way, that the early peer to peer versions failed, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5021.7s	5021.7	 Because, juice, I mean, you know, the alternatives didn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5024.5s	5024.5	 really work out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5025.7s	5025.7	 Right. Yeah, exactly. Right. So I mean, BitTorrent did exist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5029.7s	5029.7	 during this time, it's not like it was zero. But generally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5032.5s	5032.5	 speaking, this was the era of hub and spoke MVC dominance. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5035.9s	5035.9	 now we're into a third architecture, which I call CBC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5039.6s	5039.6	 client blockchain client. And so desktop clients have a blockchain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5045.5s	5045.5	 that they communicate with, for example, I have a wallet, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5048.3s	5048.3	 have a wallet on your client, and then the Bitcoin blockchain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5050.5s	5050.5	 intermediates us I debit and credit you. Okay, that's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5054.1s	5054.1	 different architecture than both MVC and CBC, it actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5056.6s	5056.6	 combines the positive qualities of both. It's decentralized and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5060.5s	5060.5	 open source and programmable like peer to peer. But it also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5064.2s	5064.2	 has global state and it's highly monetizable like MVC. So it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5067.6s	5067.6	 combines the best of both worlds. And it has some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5069.6s	5069.6	 something that's very new, which is not open source, where it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5072.6s	5072.6	 open source code, it's open state, where it's open state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5075.5s	5075.5	 database. Like open state means the back end is open also. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5079.9s	5079.9	 all the applications that get built out, essentially, our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5082.5s	5082.5	 clients that same back end that same Bitcoin or Ethereum or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5085.1s	5085.1	 what have you back end, and then you kind of exchange
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5087.3s	5087.3	 between them and the true scarcity now comes not from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5089.7s	5089.7	 locking in your users, but from holding a currency, it kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5092.8s	5092.8	 gets reduced, the IP gets reduced to its minimal viable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5095.3s	5095.3	 thing, which is holding that cryptocurrency and what you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5097.4s	5097.4	 do with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5097.7s	5097.7	 But so give me the give me the media analogy, right? So where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5100.5s	5100.5	 does your media sit? And how do I as a user have an experience on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5105.6s	5105.6	 what media to view and to access like think about because again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5109.1s	5109.1	 like just speaking in a in a layman's term for folks, maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5113.4s	5113.4	 understand, you know, most people, I don't think understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5115.2s	5115.2	 the dynamics of what underlies a social network as much as they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5117.6s	5117.6	 understand the user experience of browsing YouTube, right? So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5120.3s	5120.3	 yeah, what is what is my option in browsing the decentralized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5124.1s	5124.1	 version of YouTube? What does that experience end up looking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5126.8s	5126.8	 like in this decentralized world? Right? Who ultimately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5130.6s	5130.6	 adjudicates the algorithm that defines what my recommended
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5133.8s	5133.8	 videos are that I'm going to be accessing from these kind of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5137.5s	5137.5	 you know, different nodes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5138.6s	5138.6	 Well, I think the idea is you can bring your own, you can pick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5140.7s	5140.7	 one, there'll be a library of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5141.9s	5141.9	 Well, that's my point is like the picking function is what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5144.2s	5144.2	 doesn't didn't work in web 1.0 or web 0.9, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5147.3s	5147.3	 So we'll take a take a look at. So first of all, that state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5151.2s	5151.2	 could potentially so today, blockchains are not very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5154.4s	5154.4	 scalable. But tomorrow, they already actually they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5158.9s	5158.9	 improving very rapidly. If you're if you're following
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5160.7s	5160.7	 Matic, if you're following polygon, and if you're looking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5164.8s	5164.8	 at what Solana is doing, like you can do a lot more on chain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5168.4s	5168.4	 in 2021 than you could in 2020. It's it's kind of like bandwidth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5171.3s	5171.3	 it just improves every year. So more applications will become
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5175.7s	5175.7	 feasible like search indexes. Moreover, blockchains actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5178.6s	5178.6	 suggest to your specific point about search indexing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5180.8s	5180.8	 Blockchains actually radically simplify search into such a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5183.8s	5183.8	 point there are dark horse competitor to Google. What I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5186.4s	5186.4	 by that is Google index the open web because open web is open.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5190.9s	5190.9	 And then social networks were like a dark web, you know, to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5194.9s	5194.9	 them where that's why they were so mad. Google was so mad, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5197.6s	5197.6	 couldn't acquire Facebook, right? Because it couldn't index
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5200.1s	5200.1	 index Twitter had to deals with them. That's all on their you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5203.0s	5203.0	 know, on their servers. So the social web is even harder to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5205.6s	5205.6	 index than the open web. But block explorer blockchains and,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5210.7s	5210.7	 you know, block explorers, which are like search engines on top
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5212.7s	5212.7	 of them. Blockchains are easier to index in either the open web
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5215.5s	5215.5	 or the social web. And the reason is, many of the problems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5218.5s	5218.5	 associated with indexing just go away. For example, just one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5221.3s	5221.3	 small problem, as you're probably aware, when you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5223.3s	5223.3	 indexing the open web, let's say you've got a million websites,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5225.9s	5225.9	 you're crawling, each one of them, you only have you only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5228.1s	5228.1	 have a certain bandwidth amount total. So you have to figure out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5230.4s	5230.4	 Okay, do I recrawl this site or this one, which one is going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5233.2s	5233.2	 freshen? Okay, does this update every day or not? So you have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5235.8s	5235.8	 run all these statistical estimators just to figure out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5238.1s	5238.1	 when to crawl a site. All that goes away, for example, in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5240.6s	5240.6	 context of a blockchain where you just subscribe, and you get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5243.9s	5243.9	 a block of transactions, everybody's got the real time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5246.7s	5246.7	 index and they can there's no advantage being Google and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5249.4s	5249.4	 having to surf on freeburg we got a wrap for bestie Chamath,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=87&t=5296.3s	5296.3	 we should all just get a room and just have one big huge
