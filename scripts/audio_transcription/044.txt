https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=494.7s	494.7	 Yeah, that's going to be a big deal.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=500.5s	500.5	 And to my syndicate members,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=502.9s	502.9	 people don't know this, but it was the absolute record we've ever had for any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=506.6s	506.6	 syndicate. I believe at the end of the day, we had 150 slots and we had 950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=511.2s	511.2	 people apply Sachs. Amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=513.0s	513.0	 We had a million or so in allocation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=516.2s	516.2	 And I think we had seven million in demand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=518.8s	518.8	 I'm really excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=521.2s	521.2	 I'm really excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=522.0s	522.0	 Colin's going to be huge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=523.3s	523.3	 Yes, I'm really excited about this product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=525.4s	525.4	 It's the best product I've been involved in creating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=528.4s	528.4	 It's better than Yammer. It's better than PayPal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=530.8s	530.8	 Truly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=532.9s	532.9	 Spicy take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=534.3s	534.3	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=536.4s	536.4	 I'm really glad, Daddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=537.8s	537.8	 Daddy got a little tasty food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=539.2s	539.2	 Sachs, don't hurt your don't hurt your elbow patting yourself on the back there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=543.2s	543.2	 But go ahead, continue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=545.4s	545.4	 That's all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=546.2s	546.2	 You got a little product manager elbow there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=548.3s	548.3	 Pat yourself on the back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=549.0s	549.0	 Don't dislocate your triceps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=550.4s	550.4	 The feedback we've gotten from users has been incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=552.9s	552.9	 I mean, it's just the reaction's really strong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=554.3s	554.3	 I'll tell you what's good about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=555.4s	555.4	 Here's here's what I think in out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=558.4s	558.4	 as a person who's been in podcasting for over a decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=562.1s	562.1	 The critical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=564.5s	564.5	 aspect of this is when you pop up your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=567.6s	567.6	 club or room on Colin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=570.4s	570.4	 it creates a podcast out of it with an RSS feed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=575.1s	575.1	 And you can go listen to the previous show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=577.3s	577.3	 So if you are listening to this and you wanted to create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=580.9s	580.9	 your own version of all in, you could do it on Colin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=584.1s	584.1	 Just get three of your knucklehead friends and talk about your adventures
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=587.8s	587.8	 on boats and private jets and drinking fine wine wherever you are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=590.8s	590.8	 And you can start your own podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=592.8s	592.8	 Yeah, it's not really expensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=593.9s	593.9	 Why not included? Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=595.2s	595.2	 It's not the key insight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=596.3s	596.3	 It's not about the room. It's about the show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=598.7s	598.7	 You know, like everything we think of as social audio is really just a feature
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=602.6s	602.6	 of creating a show of creating a new podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=605.5s	605.5	 And so anyway, people really like it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=607.8s	607.8	 I'm very excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=608.6s	608.6	 September shows have been created in the beta.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=611.5s	611.5	 This is the thing that's blown me away is like well over 100.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=614.1s	614.1	 I think maybe a couple of hundred.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=615.8s	615.8	 If you go to the show director and the cover art that people have created
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=619.3s	619.3	 is really elaborate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=620.5s	620.5	 You know, people are really getting into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=622.7s	622.7	 I don't know why somebody's never made it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=625.3s	625.3	 You're a phenomenal product builder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=627.6s	627.6	 So I think this is really exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=629.4s	629.4	 Yeah, under underrated product builder, I would say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=631.5s	631.5	 But it's just interesting that this doesn't exist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=633.4s	633.4	 Somebody should have made this already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=634.7s	634.7	 Like there's ZenCast and Riverside for recording podcasts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=639.0s	639.0	 There's Libsyn for hosting them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=640.6s	640.6	 What what's happened as a as a protected minority?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=643.6s	643.6	 I'd like to ask this question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=644.5s	644.5	 What happens?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=645.1s	645.1	 What's happening to Clubhouse?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=648.8s	648.8	 I think it's irrelevant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=650.0s	650.0	 I'll be I don't want to dunk on founders, but I think that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=656.8s	656.8	 why can't they just do these features?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=658.2s	658.2	 It sounds like I'm not trying to take anything away from you, David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=661.1s	661.1	 But these are just features for sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=662.9s	662.9	 I think they will copy it at some point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=664.4s	664.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=664.8s	664.8	 But but I think that it's a good question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=667.3s	667.3	 And I really think there's different visions here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=669.7s	669.7	 So, I mean, I've listened to their founder talk about his vision,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=672.8s	672.8	 and it's very much about creating this live serendipitous type experience,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=676.7s	676.7	 like kind of like a cocktail party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=678.4s	678.4	 And that's fine. We're not doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=680.0s	680.0	 We're creating long tail podcasting is what we're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=682.7s	682.7	 And my experience is informed by what we've all been doing on the show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=685.3s	685.3	 for last year and a half, which is podcasting. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=688.0s	688.0	 And the thing that I've seen that I didn't know until we did the All in Pod
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=691.2s	691.2	 is how much work goes into what J.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=693.5s	693.5	 Cal does behind the scenes. It's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=695.5s	695.5	 We got Nick doing six hours of post-production on the show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=699.0s	699.0	 I want to automate all that work away so anybody can do what we do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=702.8s	702.8	 And that's like a very different vision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=704.2s	704.2	 No offense, Nick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=706.4s	706.4	 No, I mean, not everybody is going to want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=710.7s	710.7	 put the type of post-production into this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=712.5s	712.5	 They don't have, you know, I've got six people on our podcast team.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=715.4s	715.4	 Like it's not everybody's got that infrastructure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=717.2s	717.2	 So over time, you'll build that. I believe it will turn out great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=720.6s	720.6	 All right. Let's get to our first topic here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=723.8s	723.8	 While we were away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=726.8s	726.8	 The United States started
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=728.9s	728.9	 the process of leaving Afghanistan after a 20 year war,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=734.0s	734.0	 in which I think it's pretty safe to say that was an unwinnable war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=738.5s	738.5	 And we have felt like the Russians did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=742.7s	742.7	 Sax had a tweet that was getting a little bit of play on the old Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=748.2s	748.2	 What we're seeing before our eyes is the collapse of the American empire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=751.7s	751.7	 because the people in charge are completely corrupt and incompetent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=754.6s	754.6	 But we can't talk about that because insiders can never criticize other insiders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=760.8s	760.8	 The Larry Summers rule.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=763.2s	763.2	 Did I tweet that? You did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=766.2s	766.2	 Yeah, you might have had a couple of drinks and then.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=769.4s	769.4	 Sorry, he actually didn't. He just texted that in the group.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=772.4s	772.4	 OK, so that was a confidential text to our thought, to our group
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=775.7s	775.7	 that we're not supposed to even say exists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=777.8s	777.8	 No, it's OK. Don't beep it. It's OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=779.8s	779.8	 I mean, it's it's it's true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=781.2s	781.2	 It's it's not exactly what I tweeted, but it's similar to things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=783.9s	783.9	 I've been tweeting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=785.6s	785.6	 And tragically, yesterday,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=789.0s	789.0	 ISIS, Kay, which is an Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=793.5s	793.5	 claimed responsibility for two suicide bombings outside of the airport.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=798.5s	798.5	 And that tragically killed over 100 people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=802.5s	802.5	 90 Afghan citizens and 13 American service members.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=807.2s	807.2	 I guess, you know, we're not here to talk about wars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=811.3s	811.3	 It's not exactly in the mandate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=813.0s	813.0	 but everybody wants our opinion on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=815.1s	815.1	 So let's get started.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=816.2s	816.2	 Sax, you have strong opinions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=817.4s	817.4	 We'll start. Well, it's yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=818.4s	818.4	 I mean, how can you not talk about this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=820.0s	820.0	 This feels to me this is one of those events where, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=822.7s	822.7	 I was glued to my TV for days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=824.6s	824.6	 I think I was in France at the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=826.5s	826.5	 The Taliban overrun over in Kabul.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=829.6s	829.6	 And yeah, it was, you know, the Afghanistan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=831.5s	831.5	 war has been going on for 20 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=832.9s	832.9	 No one's been talking about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=834.0s	834.0	 It's just this thing that's been happening in the background.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=835.7s	835.7	 But all along, we've been assured by the Pentagon that we're winning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=840.4s	840.4	 Hey, you know, don't worry about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=841.9s	841.9	 We got this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=842.7s	842.7	 And then you wake up one day and all of a sudden we've lost the war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=845.4s	845.4	 and the Taliban's overrunning the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=847.5s	847.5	 And you're like, what is going on here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=849.6s	849.6	 You know, not only is the the botched withdrawal incompetent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=853.8s	853.8	 the fact that we were lied to for two decades about what was really happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=858.4s	858.4	 The idea that we had created, you know, we were how many times were we told
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=861.6s	861.6	 that we had created this Afghan army?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=863.3s	863.3	 It was three strong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=864.8s	864.8	 We spent, you know, two trillion dollars in the country,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=868.7s	868.7	 you know, being and we were told the whole time that we were building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=871.0s	871.0	 institutions there, that, you know, that we were creating a democracy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=875.8s	875.8	 in the Middle East, that we were even, you know, promoting gender equality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=880.4s	880.4	 and lecturing the Taliban on toxic masculinity or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=884.3s	884.3	 And then we find out one day that, poof, the whole thing was just kind of a lie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=887.2s	887.2	 It was this giant debacle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=889.1s	889.1	 And now we can't even get our we can't even get our civilians out of the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=895.2s	895.2	 Not only that, but we've seen 12 people, 12 American
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=898.7s	898.7	 servicemen and women killed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=901.8s	901.8	 Yesterday, trying to 13, trying to protect the airport,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=905.5s	905.5	 almost 100 Afghans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=909.6s	909.6	 Now we don't only have to not only contend with the Taliban, whose positions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=913.3s	913.3	 I don't think any of us know about, but we also have to deal with ISIS K,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=917.2s	917.2	 which is like some, you know, offshoot affiliate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=920.8s	920.8	 of ISIS run by a guy who was actually summarily killed by the Taliban.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=924.4s	924.4	 But that didn't clearly stop anybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=926.8s	926.8	 The the level of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=930.6s	930.6	 Honestly, just to say the the the lying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=934.4s	934.4	 that we've been doing on this topic is just utterly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=940.5s	940.5	 It's really, really scary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=943.6s	943.6	 You know, how could we have gone 20 years, two trillion dollars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=947.4s	947.4	 2400 American lives and counting and found a way to just basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=953.2s	953.2	 waste all this money and tell ourselves these lies for so long?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=957.9s	957.9	 And it turns out none of it was true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=960.9s	960.9	 And then the back half of it is that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=964.0s	964.0	 We look like a little bit of a country that's sort of in decline
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=968.5s	968.5	 because we can't even figure out an orderly withdrawal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=972.0s	972.0	 It's not as if, you know, this thing came out of the blue, out of nowhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=975.1s	975.1	 This was a negotiated withdrawal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=976.8s	976.8	 So we had months to plan for this, you know, and we had months to do the right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=981.0s	981.0	 honorable, moral thing for all of these for all of these people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=984.6s	984.6	 that helped us in that country, just to give you a small anecdote.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=988.8s	988.8	 You know, the day that Kabul was overrun, you know, the Democrats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=992.4s	992.4	 were actually tweeting out about celebrating Librarian Day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=997.9s	997.9	 That's what they were focused on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=999.9s	999.9	 Jason and I on the way back, you know, we flew back with my with my mom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1003.8s	1003.8	 and my sister, we stopped in Toronto to drop them off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1007.0s	1007.0	 And the planes beside us, Jason, you know, we were in the middle of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1010.1s	1010.1	 the plane, and the planes were flying beside us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1012.4s	1012.4	 Jason, do you remember this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1013.6s	1013.6	 Yeah, I think I think Brett or Paul were telling us or my pilots were telling us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1018.4s	1018.4	 These planes have been going back and forth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1022.7s	1022.7	 Saving refugees in Afghanistan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1025.6s	1025.6	 And it's like, wow, what an honor to just be beside these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1028.5s	1028.5	 these amazingly heroic men and women.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1030.6s	1030.6	 And, you know, I don't know, Jason, if you saw, but as we were refueling,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1033.8s	1033.8	 they came and boarded and they were getting ready to leave again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1036.4s	1036.4	 America cannot get even to a point of view on the topic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1040.3s	1040.3	 And I think that's what's so shameful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1042.5s	1042.5	 It's like, not only did we spend the money, not only did we lose all these lives,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1046.2s	1046.2	 not only did we have an orderly withdrawal, we couldn't even at the end

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1054.1s	1054.1	 who risk their lives to help us fight clearly a useless war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1058.3s	1058.3	 Freeberg, you have lots of watching all this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1060.7s	1060.7	 I know you don't like when we delve into politics too much, but what do you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1064.0s	1064.0	 yet you have any thoughts you want to add?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1065.4s	1065.4	 Yeah, I don't know if it's about politics as much as I kind of use a little bit of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1070.4s	1070.4	 a startup analogy, like America never really found product market fit with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1076.7s	1076.7	 what we were trying to do in Afghanistan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1081.5s	1081.5	 There's some fantastic Gallup polling that's been done in Afghanistan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1085.8s	1085.8	 over the past 15, 20 years already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1088.5s	1088.5	 And they've actually had people on the ground polling there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1091.6s	1091.6	 And most recently, which has been consistent for over 10 years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1095.4s	1095.4	 polling shown that 87 to 90 percent of Afghans said that the government is corrupt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1102.0s	1102.0	 This is the government, you know, put in power, put in place by the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1106.8s	1106.8	 90 percent say businesses are corrupt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1109.7s	1109.7	 And if you go back to a poll they ran in 2010, the question was in general,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1115.0s	1115.0	 which of these statements comes closest to your point of view?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1118.1s	1118.1	 Sharia law must be the only source of legislation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1121.5s	1121.5	 Fifty six percent of the Afghan population in 2010 believe that to be true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1125.7s	1125.7	 And another 38 percent said Sharia law must be a source of legislation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1129.7s	1129.7	 but not the only source that leaves just seven percent of people that think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1133.7s	1133.7	 that Sharia law should not be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1135.5s	1135.5	 Is it Sharia or Sharia?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1137.3s	1137.3	 Sorry, Sharia law should not be part of the legislative process
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1141.8s	1141.8	 in defining the Afghan laws and constitution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1144.4s	1144.4	 And so, you know, it's really telling that, you know, it's almost like when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1148.4s	1148.4	 when you start a company and you try and create a product and you sell it to a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1151.0s	1151.0	 customer base, you got to figure out what the product is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1153.0s	1153.0	 You got to make sure the customers want it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1155.1s	1155.1	 And then the idea for the startup works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1159.0s	1159.0	 The problem here is our views as a nation and maybe Western democracy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1165.0s	1165.0	 doesn't necessarily fit with what that market wants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1167.6s	1167.6	 And we can certainly make the case that we believe that our ethics and our values
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1171.0s	1171.0	 are superior and provide more of an opportunity for individual freedom and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1173.8s	1173.8	 liberty, things that we believe should be available around the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1178.1s	1178.1	 But if the market's not buying it, the customers don't want it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1181.4s	1181.4	 You're really just raising a ton of venture money trying to create a product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1184.6s	1184.6	 that no one really wants. And at the end of the day, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1186.6s	1186.6	 trillion dollars down and you have to shut the thing down and it goes bankrupt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1190.3s	1190.3	 And that's effectively what went down here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1192.6s	1192.6	 And if you look at the history of Afghanistan, remember, they were in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1195.0s	1195.0	 Soviet Afghan war in the 80s, nearly the entire decade of the 80s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1198.5s	1198.5	 Then the Taliban came along and provided a degree of stability in the 90s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1202.4s	1202.4	 And then all of a sudden, this Al Qaeda, 9-11 war began,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1207.6s	1207.6	 after Taliban had been in power for a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1209.2s	1209.2	 And it's been 20 plus years of strife and 20 years of strife and challenge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1214.7s	1214.7	 where the population have increasingly viewed the government to be corrupt,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1218.8s	1218.8	 businesses to be corrupt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1220.4s	1220.4	 And here's a really interesting statistic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1223.4s	1223.4	 which also came out of this polling that Gallup does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1226.4s	1226.4	 Over the last 10 years, the percentage of Afghans that are happy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1229.8s	1229.8	 with their present household income has gone or are not happy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1234.1s	1234.1	 sorry, with their present household income has gone from 60 percent to 90 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1237.9s	1237.9	 Nine out of 10 Afghans as of last year were not making enough money to make ends meet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1243.4s	1243.4	 So you put all of these facts together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1245.2s	1245.2	 You've got this long history of strife with this, you know, company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1248.7s	1248.7	 effectively coming in, trying to tell you how to run your government,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1250.8s	1250.8	 how to run your country that doesn't match with your beliefs on your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1254.9s	1254.9	 the way you think a government should be built.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1256.8s	1256.8	 You've got all of this turmoil that's happened historically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1259.3s	1259.3	 You know, it really was, I would say, to some degree,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1262.7s	1262.7	 this inevitable failure of a startup that got overfunded,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1265.5s	1265.5	 that never found product market fit, that never really got off the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1268.6s	1268.6	 Certainly the exit strategy on how do you wind something down in this case?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1271.6s	1271.6	 And it certainly relates to human lives and the tragedy of the partners
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1274.8s	1274.8	 that we had on the ground was totally mishandled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1278.5s	1278.5	 But the broader picture here is like we.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1280.1s	1280.1	 I think it's more corrupt than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1281.5s	1281.5	 I think that we basically engaged in a two trillion dollar wealth transfer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1285.4s	1285.4	 from the people of the United States, the citizens of the United States
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1288.3s	1288.3	 to the military industrial complex. That's what we did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1291.1s	1291.1	 Well, I mean, I have two points I want to I want to build on from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1294.5s	1294.5	 from yours, Friedberg and now yours, Chamath, which is the original mandate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1297.8s	1297.8	 here was to go and get rid of Al Qaeda and to also.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1302.2s	1302.2	 You know, kill Osama bin Laden and to not have the Taliban
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1307.9s	1307.9	 giving safe harbor to Al Qaeda, that quick, that mission
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1311.0s	1311.0	 got accomplished in large part in the first year or two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1314.3s	1314.3	 And then when we finally got to Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1319.6s	1319.6	 it probably would have been a better idea to understand this is an unwinnable war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1323.1s	1323.1	 Get in there, destroy the Taliban, leave and then say, if you come back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1327.4s	1327.4	 we'll do it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1328.3s	1328.3	 But we're not going to stay here for 20 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1330.2s	1330.2	 To your point, Friedberg and try to create a revolution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1333.0s	1333.0	 if the people are not ready for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1334.6s	1334.6	 I think that we have to start looking at our foreign policy and saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1338.1s	1338.1	 we do need we do have a better view of human rights clearly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1342.0s	1342.0	 than the Middle East and certainly Afghanistan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1345.0s	1345.0	 And we do want to promote human rights around the world and freedom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1347.9s	1347.9	 We're not doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1349.0s	1349.0	 We're not we're not we're not freedom fighters of democracy or justice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1352.4s	1352.4	 We should let we should be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1354.3s	1354.3	 We are led by motives of revenue and profit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1356.6s	1356.6	 I know that, but we should be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1357.9s	1357.9	 And when we went and we kicked the Nazis asses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1360.6s	1360.6	 and we beat Japan when, you know, they were trying to dominate the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1364.5s	1364.5	 We were doing it to stop communism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1366.7s	1366.7	 And I think when you look at nation building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1369.5s	1369.5	 and these these kind of revolutions to Friedberg's point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1373.2s	1373.2	 they have to want it as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1374.6s	1374.6	 So we should be working with the countries that are teetering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1378.0s	1378.0	 on going from authoritarianism to democracy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1380.9s	1380.9	 And we should take the high ground and we should be the more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1383.3s	1383.3	 authoritative of the world because we're not who's going to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1386.5s	1386.5	 I agree with that part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1388.0s	1388.0	 But I think the right thing to do is just to open our doors and say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1390.6s	1390.6	 you know what, we're here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1392.2s	1392.2	 There is a draft.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1393.6s	1393.6	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1394.2s	1394.2	 And the smart and the capable and the willing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1397.3s	1397.3	 we're willing to basically bring inside of our borders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1400.8s	1400.8	 so that they can work on our behalf.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1403.6s	1403.6	 And that's what other countries, I think, get right about all of this stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1407.3s	1407.3	 Like, again, as a Canadian,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1410.3s	1410.3	 you know, the Canadian perspective of this is not that you deploy troops
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1413.9s	1413.9	 and you get embroiled in these, you know, debacles over 20 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1417.9s	1417.9	 and thousands of lives and trillions of dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1419.7s	1419.7	 It's the exact opposite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1421.0s	1421.0	 They're there to support humanitarian efforts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1424.2s	1424.2	 Right. They're there to send peacekeeping forces as they need to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1427.7s	1427.7	 But otherwise, their real response is to actually then open the borders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1431.5s	1431.5	 for folks that want to be there who are then wanting to trade up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1434.5s	1434.5	 Jason to those values, because that's the simple way to self-select.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1437.5s	1437.5	 Instead of saying, I'm going to impose my version of democracy over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1441.5s	1441.5	 I'm actually going to show you what our version looks like over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1444.2s	1444.2	 And if you want to come, the doors are open.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1445.8s	1445.8	 Certainly being an example is step one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1448.2s	1448.2	 And we, I think, do that largely well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1451.2s	1451.2	 But we do need to sometimes intervene.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1453.2s	1453.2	 And I think that's the question here is, when is it just to intervene
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1456.5s	1456.5	 when there is human rights on the line
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1458.7s	1458.7	 and a country is teetering on authoritarianism or democracy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1462.2s	1462.2	 Like, where is that line?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1463.3s	1463.3	 The just cause here was to go get Osama bin Laden because he attacked us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1468.3s	1468.3	 And we should have gotten out of that country as soon as we realized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1470.9s	1470.9	 that bin Laden was no longer there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1472.9s	1472.9	 I mean, that was basically after the Battle of Tora Bora.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1476.2s	1476.2	 And if we didn't leave then, we certainly should have left
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1478.6s	1478.6	 after we got bin Laden in around 2010.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1481.8s	1481.8	 So what were we still doing there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1483.3s	1483.3	 We were engaged in this exercise of nation building, which, by the way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1486.3s	1486.3	 we spent six trillion dollars on nation building exercises
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1489.7s	1489.7	 in the Middle East between Afghanistan and Iraq.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1492.8s	1492.8	 For what? For not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1494.0s	1494.0	 This is why the electorate is in such a foul mood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1495.8s	1495.8	 How many of our domestic disputes are caused by the fact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1499.0s	1499.0	 that we squandered that six trillion dollars?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1501.4s	1501.4	 That's more than Biden's entire domestic agenda.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1505.9s	1505.9	 So we wasted all this money to Freiburg's point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1508.9s	1508.9	 We never understood the culture there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1511.0s	1511.0	 And to Chema's point, it was a giant money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1513.2s	1513.2	 funneling operation to defense contractors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1516.2s	1516.2	 There's a great piece of reporting by an independent journalist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1519.2s	1519.2	 named Michael Tracy, and he talked to frontline grunts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1523.0s	1523.0	 about the wasteful spending.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1524.9s	1524.9	 You know, they would send 12 humvees to some local Afghan partner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1528.9s	1528.9	 Only two of them would ever get there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1530.6s	1530.6	 The other 10 would break down and disappear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1532.7s	1532.7	 And no one would even know where all the money went.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1534.8s	1534.8	 It was like an unbelievable orgy of wastefulness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1538.5s	1538.5	 And, you know, one other important detail on this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1541.6s	1541.6	 there's a guy who I think should be much more famous to all of us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1545.9s	1545.9	 His name is John F.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1546.8s	1546.8	 Sopko, he's the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1551.3s	1551.3	 That short for cigar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1552.7s	1552.7	 He was appointed by Congress about 13 years ago to look into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1556.3s	1556.3	 what was really happening in Afghanistan and to report on, quote,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1559.9s	1559.9	 quote, unquote, lessons learned from the Afghan war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1561.8s	1561.8	 And so for 13 years, Sopko has been very quietly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1566.0s	1566.0	 diligently interviewing people from everyone from frontline troops
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1569.7s	1569.7	 to commanders about what's really been happening in Afghanistan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1572.9s	1572.9	 And he's been releasing these reports that everyone in D.C.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1575.7s	1575.7	 knows about, but nobody in the country knows about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1578.2s	1578.2	 Let me just read you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1580.3s	1580.3	 These are just the chapter titles from his latest report.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1583.4s	1583.4	 OK, Jesus, just the chapter titles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1586.5s	1586.5	 Harmful spending patterns, resistance to honesty,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1590.0s	1590.0	 personnel struggles, willful disregard for critical information,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1594.4s	1594.4	 incorrect theories of change, poor understanding of local context.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1598.8s	1598.8	 And by the way, that includes ignoring things like the sexual abuse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1603.1s	1603.1	 of young boys by Afghan warlords who are our allies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1606.2s	1606.2	 OK, which the New York Times reported on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1608.0s	1608.0	 We completely have swept that under the rug. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1610.6s	1610.6	 That's just a table of contents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1612.3s	1612.3	 OK, from one of his latest reports, which is about 100 pages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1615.9s	1615.9	 Complete incompetence in our in our government, complete waste.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1618.9s	1618.9	 The Pentagon was telling us the whole time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1620.7s	1620.7	 I mean, while this guy, Sopko, the cigar,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1623.6s	1623.6	 the special inspector general was telling us the truth of what was happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1627.0s	1627.0	 You've got the Pentagon telling us and the elected leaders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1630.6s	1630.6	 the whole time that we're winning this war, that things are improving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1634.0s	1634.0	 They had all these bogus metrics to prove it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1637.6s	1637.6	 And, you know, it's just it's a systemic failure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1641.4s	1641.4	 But sex, what would be their motivation to say it's not working?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1645.4s	1645.4	 Look, I think I think that, well, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1647.8s	1647.8	 What would be the motivation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1648.8s	1648.8	 You can't you can't fix what you don't measure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1650.8s	1650.8	 And so basically, like if you want to lie there, there you have it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1654.5s	1654.5	 We have that now for 20 years of lying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1656.5s	1656.5	 Let's talk about the metrics, because this is actually an important point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1659.0s	1659.0	 But this is my point is like, what's what's the objective for them to be measured?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1664.2s	1664.2	 What's the objective in that case?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1665.9s	1665.9	 The objective is to demonstrate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1667.1s	1667.1	 Now, the objective is to demonstrate leadership.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1669.0s	1669.0	 The objective is to basically say, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1671.4s	1671.4	 This is really not working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1673.2s	1673.2	 And this is about putting yourself in the position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1676.7s	1676.7	 of a person whose child is over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1679.7s	1679.7	 OK, if any of our children were there who signed up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1683.9s	1683.9	 because they thought they wanted to do the right thing and and and, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1687.4s	1687.4	 be in the army or the Navy or the Marines, found themselves in Afghanistan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1692.0s	1692.0	 got killed, God, heaven forbid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1694.8s	1694.8	 And then that body comes back and this report comes with it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1699.5s	1699.5	 which is effectively what it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1701.3s	1701.3	 OK, this is the coda to the death of two point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1704.3s	1704.3	 you know, 2400 Americans and two trillion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1707.8s	1707.8	 I would be so heartbroken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1709.5s	1709.5	 I am heartbroken just thinking about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1711.5s	1711.5	 Like this is not that's not what we're about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1714.9s	1714.9	 So we can't keep doing this and we can't keep lying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1717.4s	1717.4	 We can't rationalize lying anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1721.2s	1721.2	 Right. Well, I agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1722.7s	1722.7	 And let me just speak to the point about the metrics,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1724.8s	1724.8	 because the problem was not that we didn't have any metrics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1727.2s	1727.2	 The problem is that the metrics are bogus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1729.2s	1729.2	 Now, why is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1730.0s	1730.0	 Well, first of all, the mission was very unclear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1732.6s	1732.6	 It's not clear how you measure the success
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1736.0s	1736.0	 of transforming a country to Afghan, like Afghanistan to our values.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1740.3s	1740.3	 I mean, what what really are the metrics for that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1742.2s	1742.2	 So what the military started doing is not measuring outputs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1746.0s	1746.0	 but measuring inputs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1747.4s	1747.4	 So you have, you know, the commanders on the ground saying, well, today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1750.9s	1750.9	 we trained a thousand new Afghan troops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1753.7s	1753.7	 OK, but what they don't say is that over 90 percent of those troops
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1757.1s	1757.1	 are illiterate and 85 percent of them are on drugs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1759.8s	1759.8	 I mean, and this is what the journalists who are on the ground
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1762.2s	1762.2	 when they would do the interviews with these, you know, with these,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1765.4s	1765.4	 you know, frontline commanders or trainers, they would find this out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1769.1s	1769.1	 Now, why wasn't this in the report?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1770.7s	1770.7	 Well, because the military is a culture that's based on advancement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1774.9s	1774.9	 It's basically the Pentagon is a big country club.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1777.3s	1777.3	 It's a big insider's club. There's a dogma.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1780.1s	1780.1	 The dogma was we're winning the war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1782.2s	1782.2	 And if you want to advance in that organization, you're not going to be the one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1785.3s	1785.3	 You're not going to be the skunk at the garden party who tells the generals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1788.8s	1788.8	 that they're full of shit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1789.9s	1789.9	 You're basically going to be the guy who gives them the metrics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1791.8s	1791.8	 They want to hear. And then their boss, the person who's the boss,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1795.6s	1795.6	 the frontline guy is going to improve things 20 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1799.2s	1799.2	 He's going to shape things another 20 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1801.2s	1801.2	 And then the next guy in the chain of command shapes things 20 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1803.8s	1803.8	 And by the time you get all the way to the top,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1806.4s	1806.4	 the chairman of the chiefs is telling Biden, we have an army that's 300,000 strong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1811.9s	1811.9	 These guys are going to take over the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1813.5s	1813.5	 We're not going to have a problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1814.3s	1814.3	 We're going to have plenty of time to get our people out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1817.0s	1817.0	 And that is why we had a lackadaisical withdrawal strategy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1819.6s	1819.6	 These guys thought they had all the time in the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1821.6s	1821.6	 because systemically they've been bullshitting themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1824.2s	1824.2	 about having a 300,000 man Afghan army.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1827.0s	1827.0	 And then, you know, when you actually look under the hood of this thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1830.0s	1830.0	 there is no army.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1831.2s	1831.2	 It's just a basically a bunch of kleptocracy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1833.8s	1833.8	 I think what happened at the end of this thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1836.9s	1836.9	 is even more dangerous for the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1839.0s	1839.0	 On top of everything you said, David, which I agree with, is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1842.2s	1842.2	 what we basically said is that we will engage in whatever coverup is necessary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1847.2s	1847.2	 because we're not willing to lead and talk about the mistakes we've made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1850.9s	1850.9	 and to do the things that are necessary to really fix it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1853.3s	1853.3	 And that's what's really fucking sad, because as he said, as you said, Sax,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1857.6s	1857.6	 the minute that you knew that bin Laden wasn't there, we had a choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1862.5s	1862.5	 Then the minute you knew that he was already dead, we had a choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1866.1s	1866.1	 And the choice was to do the fucking right thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1868.9s	1868.9	 And instead, what happened was we got caught up in virtue signaling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1873.2s	1873.2	 We got caught up in personal advancement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1875.5s	1875.5	 We got caught up in the grift.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1877.3s	1877.3	 We got caught up in graft.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1878.8s	1878.8	 We got caught up in corruption.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1880.2s	1880.2	 We got caught up in the military industrial complex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1883.2s	1883.2	 And here's here's where we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1885.0s	1885.0	 And the crazy thing is Biden had a moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1888.7s	1888.7	 Where he could have stepped in and said, you know what, guys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1891.0s	1891.0	 I'm looking at all of this data, here's the new plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1894.8s	1894.8	 And he didn't do it either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1896.1s	1896.1	 Let me ask you a question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1896.9s	1896.9	 If Biden had run an orderly exit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1900.4s	1900.4	 and then it spiraled into Taliban and reverted back to what it was,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1904.8s	1904.8	 how would you feel about all this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1906.3s	1906.3	 I think that would have been that's the goal, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1908.8s	1908.8	 Trump wanted to get out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1910.4s	1910.4	 And Biden both wanted to get out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1911.4s	1911.4	 So if we just executed twice as good or 50 percent better,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1914.4s	1914.4	 there'd be no problem here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1915.2s	1915.2	 We all want to be out. Correct?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1916.7s	1916.7	 Yes. That decision, the decision to get out was a 70 percent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1920.2s	1920.2	 popular decision when Biden made the decision in April.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1923.3s	1923.3	 And then they made it last time because he did the.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1927.7s	1927.7	 This is a bipartisan decision to get out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1929.8s	1929.8	 Let's not pretend otherwise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1931.1s	1931.1	 It was clearly the correct decision to get out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1933.2s	1933.2	 But here's where Biden screwed it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1934.8s	1934.8	 OK, and there's some blame that needs to be apportioned to Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1938.3s	1938.3	 and to the to the generals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1939.6s	1939.6	 And we don't really know who screwed it up, but collectively they did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1942.8s	1942.8	 The big mistake, the original sin of this withdrawal is that they pulled out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1946.9s	1946.9	 of Bagram Airfield at the beginning of July.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1950.5s	1950.5	 OK, they didn't just pull out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1951.6s	1951.6	 They literally ghosted the Afghan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1954.4s	1954.4	 I mean, they pulled out in the middle of the night without telling anybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1956.9s	1956.9	 The Afghan army, who are our allies, woke up the next morning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1961.8s	1961.8	 and the Americans were just gone and the electricity had been turned off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1965.4s	1965.4	 I mean, this was unbelievable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1967.2s	1967.2	 And so the problem is we then lost our air superiority over the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1970.9s	1970.9	 We lost our ability to conduct close combat air support.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1974.3s	1974.3	 We lost our ability to do a mass evacuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1977.0s	1977.0	 OK, we basically gave up our central military asset in the country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1980.2s	1980.2	 before we got the civilians out, before we got our allies out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1983.6s	1983.6	 And there were 18000 of these so-called SIVs, the Special Immigration Visas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1988.3s	1988.3	 These are the Afghani translators and helpers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1991.0s	1991.0	 who were embedded in our combat units.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1994.4s	1994.4	 The State Department, meanwhile, was totally caught up in bureaucracy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1997.5s	1997.5	 slow walking their applications.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=1999.4s	1999.4	 Those 18000 translators are now stuck there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2002.1s	2002.1	 OK, they have 50000 dependents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2003.8s	2003.8	 We're talking about spouses and children.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2005.8s	2005.8	 And so they have no way of getting out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2007.6s	2007.6	 And then the final thing that just takes the cake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2010.1s	2010.1	 is that we gave a list to the Taliban of here's our biggest helpers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2014.7s	2014.7	 When if they go to the checkpoints, we want you to let them through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2017.1s	2017.1	 Oh, my Lord. It was basically an assassination.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2019.2s	2019.2	 This is your death list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2020.7s	2020.7	 They've given a kill list to the Taliban.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2023.4s	2023.4	 I mean, this is really unforgivable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2025.0s	2025.0	 And it's and it's and this was it's not like this was unknown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2028.2s	2028.2	 OK, there was a bipartisan working group of both Democrats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2031.2s	2031.2	 and Republicans who wrote a letter to Blinken at the State Department
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2034.9s	2034.9	 back in May, saying we are afraid of the safety of our Afghan allies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2040.2s	2040.2	 You need to get them out now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2041.6s	2041.6	 The State Department is taking too long processing the special immigration visas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2045.4s	2045.4	 You're totally caught up in red tape bureaucracies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2047.7s	2047.7	 Solve this problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2049.2s	2049.2	 Blinken did nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2050.3s	2050.3	 He was another deer caught in the headlights.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2052.9s	2052.9	 They could have also just instead of making people fill out all these forms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2057.2s	2057.2	 and all this red tape, I heard one commenter saying, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2060.3s	2060.3	 the right thing to do in situations like this is to just get everybody out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2063.2s	2063.2	 put them in a holding location and then process them there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2067.9s	2067.9	 In other words, if this person says they were translating their family
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2070.2s	2070.2	 and they have, you know, relatively good paperwork, get them out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2073.8s	2073.8	 put them into that holding pattern and then figure out how to process them later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2078.1s	2078.1	 We got to wrap on this discussion, get to some other topics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2081.3s	2081.3	 But the interesting thing to watch here is what's going to be the future of Afghanistan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2085.8s	2085.8	 And I don't know if you guys saw the Financial Times story, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2089.2s	2089.2	 China is watching this like a hawk and they have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2092.9s	2092.9	 China and Russia are just sitting there laughing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2095.4s	2095.4	 Well, China is even worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2096.9s	2096.9	 They have aspirations of partnership in this region with Pakistan already
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2102.4s	2102.4	 and Afghanistan and building super highways and expanding their train network
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2106.6s	2106.6	 and having their own Silk Road essentially to get to the Middle East from China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2112.0s	2112.0	 And this is going to be the axis of the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2117.1s	2117.1	 Authoritarianism by Biden asked Putin if it was OK for us to stage military resources from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2123.8s	2123.8	 You know, from from from close quarters in Asia, then Putin was like, no, go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2128.8s	2128.8	 Jason, I think what you what you just pointed out is the motivating factor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2133.2s	2133.2	 for having a presence in this and other similar similarly situated territories around the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2140.5s	2140.5	 Yeah, a lot of people assume it's about imperialism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2144.3s	2144.3	 and imposing kind of American democratic principles and ideals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2147.6s	2147.6	 I think that's the way the narrative is sold internally here at this country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2150.9s	2150.9	 But the truth from the intelligence community and I think the folks that maybe are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2154.7s	2154.7	 a little bit more thoughtful and long term thinking about this sort of stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2157.8s	2157.8	 is that the absence of an American presence in certain parts of the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2162.4s	2162.4	 will enable the the success of what we would consider competing states globally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2169.0s	2169.0	 And, you know, there is still that unanswered question, ultimately,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2172.1s	2172.1	 of how do we compete on a global stage, given what is currently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2178.4s	2178.4	 a very negative view on our having a presence overseas, a military presence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2182.6s	2182.6	 overseas, a physical presence overseas in these sorts of territories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2186.5s	2186.5	 And it begs the question of does that really set us up for challenges
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2189.8s	2189.8	 and failures in the 21st century as a nation state?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2192.9s	2192.9	 As the other global players, in particular China, you know, take advantage of these things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2197.3s	2197.3	 Yeah, well, I agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2199.0s	2199.0	 And let me just let me just say why China is so smart and we are so dumb.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2203.2s	2203.2	 China is going to Afghanistan right now and cutting deals with the Taliban
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2206.7s	2206.7	 to build a highway so they can get to the rare earth minerals,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2210.8s	2210.8	 which Afghanistan is rich in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2213.1s	2213.1	 And they're going to use the super highway they're going to build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2215.4s	2215.4	 to get that out and feed their economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2217.3s	2217.3	 That is how they're going to spend their capital in Afghanistan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2220.6s	2220.6	 Meanwhile, we spent over two trillion and we have nothing to show for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2224.1s	2224.1	 You know, they go abroad in search of rare earth minerals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2226.7s	2226.7	 We go there to lecture people on toxic masculinity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2230.0s	2230.0	 It is absurd.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2231.5s	2231.5	 OK, now the president.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2234.9s	2234.9	 Well, you know, it's a little too cynical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2237.0s	2237.0	 We were also protecting, not educating women in that country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2240.9s	2240.9	 Don't forget the man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2242.0s	2242.0	 Yes, we go to get our own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2243.6s	2243.6	 That's why they then it's very important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2246.1s	2246.1	 That's right. We go there to lecture people on their pronouns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2248.7s	2248.7	 No, that is far too cynical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2250.6s	2250.6	 No, it's not. We went there to protect some people who wanted democracy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2254.9s	2254.9	 and to allow women to read and to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2257.8s	2257.8	 Oh, we remember society.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2259.5s	2259.5	 I'm sorry. We just flushed that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2260.8s	2260.8	 We just flushed that right down the toilet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2262.3s	2262.3	 Sorry. I know that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2263.2s	2263.2	 But we just not conflate that we just want to lecture them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2265.6s	2265.6	 David, David is right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2266.8s	2266.8	 We knew that the minute we pulled out, we were casting 50%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2270.5s	2270.5	 of that population to a complete state of stasis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2275.7s	2275.7	 that was completely not known.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2277.6s	2277.6	 So are you saying, Saks, that we should have stayed there with some presence?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2280.7s	2280.7	 Well, this is this is like the argument in Vietnam.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2282.8s	2282.8	 No, tell the truth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2283.8s	2283.8	 We should have just told the truth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2285.2s	2285.2	 We're leaving. We don't have a plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2287.2s	2287.2	 And this is going to risk all women.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2288.6s	2288.6	 It's going to risk people that helped us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2290.3s	2290.3	 And we are not sure what's going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2292.0s	2292.0	 But you know what? We decided we're leaving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2294.0s	2294.0	 That was the truth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2295.5s	2295.5	 Remember, remember the Vietnam War?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2297.3s	2297.3	 We killed two million Vietnamese to make the country safe for democracy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2300.9s	2300.9	 You know what the Vietnamese at the end of that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2302.4s	2302.4	 We'd rather have our two million people back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2304.2s	2304.2	 We see these wars in terms of ideology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2306.7s	2306.7	 We think we're going there to spread democracy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2308.6s	2308.6	 They see it in terms of nationalism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2310.4s	2310.4	 All they see is a foreign invader trying to impose their values.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2314.2s	2314.2	 That's why they don't buy into what we're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2316.0s	2316.0	 And by the way, the whole idea that we're going to plant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2319.0s	2319.0	 Madisonian democracy in the soil of the Middle East,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2322.4s	2322.4	 that was a 20 year folly that cost us trillions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2325.8s	2325.8	 And one of the reasons why there are no Madisons over there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2329.0s	2329.0	 there are no Madisons, there are no Jeffersons, there are no Washingtons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2332.2s	2332.2	 Who is going to take up that cause?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2333.8s	2333.8	 What we had in Afghanistan is this President Ghani,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2337.0s	2337.0	 who's a crook, who was off on the first helicopter with millions of our dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2340.9s	2340.9	 That is how stupid we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2343.6s	2343.6	 It's the last place we should be trying to do democracy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2346.1s	2346.1	 There's other places where it's teetering and we can probably be more helpful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2349.6s	2349.6	 The American president, John Quincy Adams,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2351.6s	2351.6	 this is back when America had a rational foreign policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2354.0s	2354.0	 He said, America does not go abroad in search of monsters to destroy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2359.2s	2359.2	 That used to be our foreign policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2361.1s	2361.1	 Now we involve ourselves all over the world to impose our values for no reasons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2366.4s	2366.4	 It is costing us a fortune and has led to the crumbling of the American
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2371.4s	2371.4	 of American wealth and power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2374.2s	2374.2	 And it completely erodes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2377.1s	2377.1	 Our trust in institutions, particularly the institution of the federal government,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2381.8s	2381.8	 and we're left just scratching our heads, saying, if not these guys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2384.9s	2384.9	 then who is going to figure this out?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2386.2s	2386.2	 What do we do with Taiwan?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2387.5s	2387.5	 If Chamath and Sachs, if you're.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2391.5s	2391.5	 Don't want to be if you don't want to support democracy in the world,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2394.2s	2394.2	 what happens to Taiwan in your world?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2395.9s	2395.9	 This sign, Taiwan's death warrant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2398.4s	2398.4	 I'm sorry, but you should just assume that Taiwan go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2401.6s	2401.6	 No, my point is the following.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2402.8s	2402.8	 Taiwan will when the when PRC has the right window,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2407.5s	2407.5	 be under complete Chinese control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2409.9s	2409.9	 And we because of how we have executed this and how we've executed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2414.6s	2414.6	 the rest of our Middle Asia strategy means that we will not really engage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2419.2s	2419.2	 And the reason is because it will be an enormous food fight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2422.9s	2422.9	 inside the United States where all of these past experiences of us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2427.0s	2427.0	 fucking this up will come up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2428.4s	2428.4	 Should we defend Taiwan?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2429.9s	2429.9	 Except, by the way, the difference is we're not going to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2432.2s	2432.2	 We would not be going to war with a bunch of like fucking tribal people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2436.8s	2436.8	 in the mountains carrying sticks and AK-47s from the 80s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2441.1s	2441.1	 This is China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2442.2s	2442.2	 So if we get if we if we can't beat and win in Afghanistan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2446.0s	2446.0	 I mean, we also what are our chance?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2448.2s	2448.2	 I mean, I'm sorry, guys, but our chances alone, it's not worth it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2451.0s	2451.0	 With a group of Japan, South Korea, Australia and the EU,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2457.1s	2457.1	 we should be defending Taiwan in my mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2458.8s	2458.8	 What do you think, Freeberg?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2460.0s	2460.0	 Should we try and defend Taiwan when this inevitably leads to the Chinese
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2463.4s	2463.4	 government finding their window as Chamath is predicting?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2466.4s	2466.4	 Again, I don't think that the motivating factor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2469.8s	2469.8	 could necessarily be imposing democratic principles as the priority.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2478.5s	2478.5	 If you were to to to actually weigh that decision,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2483.0s	2483.0	 you would realize that you should probably have a presence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2485.4s	2485.4	 in some Latin American countries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2488.3s	2488.3	 You should probably have a presence in Central Africa,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2490.6s	2490.6	 where there are authoritarian regimes that are doing terrible things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2493.7s	2493.7	 But we don't have a competing global interest there to defend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2499.2s	2499.2	 against.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2499.9s	2499.9	 Well, to be clear, Taiwan is right now democratic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2503.2s	2503.2	 so we would be defending a democracy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2505.2s	2505.2	 Freeberg, Jaykal is asking a specific question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2507.4s	2507.4	 If China invades Taiwan, do you think the United States should get involved?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2513.5s	2513.5	 On a principles basis, or do I think the United States will get involved?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2516.6s	2516.6	 Either one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2517.8s	2517.8	 Yeah, I mean, I think the challenge is the escalation with China, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2520.7s	2520.7	 So that's going to be the big calculus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2522.6s	2522.6	 It's really about what's the what's the long term cost.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2525.0s	2525.0	 Certainly on a on a principle basis, you'd say, let's go defend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2528.2s	2528.2	 the weak and go protect them because they share principles and ideals with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2531.7s	2531.7	 But the backlash, the challenge would be if we were to do this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2536.4s	2536.4	 global trade would stall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2538.0s	2538.0	 There would be massive issues at home with people saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2541.5s	2541.5	 that we're getting involved in an overseas war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2543.4s	2543.4	 All of the reasons that from a political perspective, it would stall our economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2546.9s	2546.9	 It will cause all these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2547.9s	2547.9	 You know, I'm kind of speculating a bit here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2550.8s	2550.8	 But the actual cost isn't just about sending a few thousand troops
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2554.2s	2554.2	 over and surrounding the island and protecting people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2556.6s	2556.6	 It's actually much more severe than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2558.3s	2558.3	 And if you were to weigh it, it could be that we end up with 25,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2561.0s	2561.0	 30 million people losing their jobs over the next decade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2564.2s	2564.2	 because of the economic fallout that occurs in our doing that and so on and so forth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2568.5s	2568.5	 And a lot of American prosperity that we get to enjoy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2571.8s	2571.8	 you know, kind of kind of declines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2573.4s	2573.4	 And so that's the real calculus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2574.8s	2574.8	 And I don't know how to do that calculus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2576.6s	2576.6	 But I think that is the calculus that is being done by the intelligence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2579.6s	2579.6	 community to figure out the answer to that question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2581.1s	2581.1	 Let's swing it to Sachs to do a little bit more of this calculus,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2583.2s	2583.2	 because what we're talking about here is not giving up an authoritarian state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2586.7s	2586.7	 that wants to be authoritarian.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2588.0s	2588.0	 We're talking about a democracy on the risk board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2590.5s	2590.5	 Yes, we take it and flipped from a democracy like Hong Kong has been flipped.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2595.4s	2595.4	 I think it's I think it's a very important distinction that Taiwan is already a democracy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2601.1s	2601.1	 They got there on their own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2602.3s	2602.3	 They've done a lot of hard work building that country since that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2605.8s	2605.8	 Basically, the country became separate from mainland China, I think, in 1945.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2610.8s	2610.8	 It's never been under the control of the CCP.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2613.2s	2613.2	 It's a free enterprise system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2616.0s	2616.0	 It's democratic capitalism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2617.4s	2617.4	 There's basically 24 million free souls who live on that island.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2621.6s	2621.6	 And if we show any weakness, and we frankly already have by what we've done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2626.2s	2626.2	 in the Middle East, if we show any weakness, they will fall under the boot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2630.3s	2630.3	 of the communist regime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2632.2s	2632.2	 So I think there's a big difference between trying to plant democracy or nation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2636.6s	2636.6	 build verse in a country that's never had it before in thousands of years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2641.2s	2641.2	 And basically being friends and allies with a country that already is a democracy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2645.8s	2645.8	 and just wants to be free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2647.6s	2647.6	 And I think our message to China should just be we like things the way they are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2651.9s	2651.9	 We don't want them to change. That's it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2653.8s	2653.8	 We have a policy of what's called strategic ambiguity to Taiwan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2657.5s	2657.5	 It basically says that we may come to the defense of Taiwan or we may not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2662.7s	2662.7	 And I think we should just continue with that policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2665.3s	2665.3	 I think our message should just be we like the status quo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2668.0s	2668.0	 We don't think it should change. Let's leave things alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2670.4s	2670.4	 I think that that's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2671.6s	2671.6	 But I think we need to be investing hundreds of billions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2674.4s	2674.4	 The trillions of dollars we wasted in Afghanistan could have been better served
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2678.3s	2678.3	 building an infrastructure in America for chips and semiconductors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2682.2s	2682.2	 and a bunch of these critical components, because then it would give us a lot more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2686.6s	2686.6	 bargaining room to actually be able to play out that strategic ambiguity more fully.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2693.1s	2693.1	 I think the reality is that despite the policy framework,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2695.9s	2695.9	 the practical economic reality is that we would be engulfed in a war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2700.0s	2700.0	 if Taiwan were taken over by China, because, as Friedberg said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2703.8s	2703.8	 our economy would ground to a halt because those critical assets are linchpins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2709.6s	2709.6	 for how massive swaths of the American economy work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2713.0s	2713.0	 Yeah, I'll tell you one thing we should be making plans for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2715.5s	2715.5	 I don't know if our military is competent enough, but we've talked on this pod
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2719.1s	2719.1	 before about how 70 percent of the advanced chips come out of Taiwan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2723.8s	2723.8	 Companies like TSMC, if China takes over that island,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2727.6s	2727.6	 I mean, those chips are the new oil, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2729.4s	2729.4	 We're going to be dependent on them in a way we never should be for our supply chain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2733.1s	2733.1	 You're right, Jamoth. We never should have gotten this dependent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2735.4s	2735.4	 But frankly, our military needs to have a plan to sabotage those chip factories
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2740.0s	2740.0	 because we can't let them fall under the control of the CCP.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2743.6s	2743.6	 I don't know if they're competent enough to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2745.5s	2745.5	 But if Taiwan falls, it needs to be a poison chalice for the CCP.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2749.9s	2749.9	 We're going to need to make some decisions here because Russia with Crimea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2753.2s	2753.2	 and the Ukraine and their ambitions and then China taking over Hong Kong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2757.6s	2757.6	 and looking at Taiwan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2759.6s	2759.6	 I mean, I think the lesson here is if you're a dictator
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2763.0s	2763.0	 and you are allowed to take over other regions and other,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2766.8s	2766.8	 you know, countries, you're not going to stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2768.8s	2768.8	 It is the nature of dictators.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2769.9s	2769.9	 And we have to at least put our foot down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2772.0s	2772.0	 You know, Afghanistan is a shit show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2773.6s	2773.6	 But these other places were flat footed right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2776.3s	2776.3	 J.K.L. We're stumbling forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2777.9s	2777.9	 We're not serious problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2779.2s	2779.2	 And so we need to we need to sort of like recenter ourselves and get momentum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2783.4s	2783.4	 You know, to use a poker analogy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2785.8s	2785.8	 basically just bluffed off half our stack with the Jack 8 offsuit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2789.7s	2789.7	 And then and then when you get the ace king suited, you have no chips to play with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2794.0s	2794.0	 Yeah, right. You know, and you're just like, what was I doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2796.7s	2796.7	 Credibility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2797.8s	2797.8	 Basically, 9-11, 9-11 put us on tilt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2800.7s	2800.7	 OK, and we've been losing pots for the last 20 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2804.1s	2804.1	 Yeah, we just lost the big one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2805.7s	2805.7	 And the question is to most point, are we going to lose the rest of our stack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2808.6s	2808.6	 or are we going to go take a walk around the block like Muth does?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2811.4s	2811.4	 Center, center, center, center, center, center.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2815.2s	2815.2	 On the re centering thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2816.8s	2816.8	 China is going in the opposite direction in a way that could actually help us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2820.7s	2820.7	 Meaning, like, you know, it's it's a pretty scary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2824.2s	2824.2	 set of things that's happening over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2826.0s	2826.0	 But it's also a kind of instructive about how we could recenter ourselves,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2829.3s	2829.3	 because there's they're actually enacting the laws that we all talk about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2832.4s	2832.4	 We've been talking about for seven months, but they're actually willing to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2835.8s	2835.8	 And they and so if American policy makers would actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2839.2s	2839.2	 pivot to what's going on over there with the China or should we go to robotics?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2842.9s	2842.9	 Let's let's finish China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2844.5s	2844.5	 And then we can talk about China is continuing their crackdown of tech companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2850.3s	2850.3	 and has proposed a ban on foreign IPOs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2853.5s	2853.5	 The Wall Street Journal had some exclusive reporting today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2856.8s	2856.8	 I'll just read a quote and then hand it over to Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2859.2s	2859.2	 China plans to propose new rules that would ban companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2862.0s	2862.0	 with large amounts of sensitive consumer data from going public in the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2865.9s	2865.9	 People familiar with the matter said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2869.0s	2869.0	 And in addition to that, under these new rules,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2872.0s	2872.0	 they are looking at the algorithms that are being run
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2876.2s	2876.2	 and different services and making them transparent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2878.6s	2878.6	 And the Chinese government will basically control the algorithms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2881.8s	2881.8	 that have caused so much chaos here in the United States with Facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2885.0s	2885.0	 and Twitter and YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2886.6s	2886.6	 And then finally, they're going to close the loophole on V.I.E.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2890.9s	2890.9	 Chamath, you want to explain what this means from a market perspective?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2894.2s	2894.2	 Today's a really big day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2896.3s	2896.3	 because of these things, Jason, as you just said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2898.4s	2898.4	 So let me just break this down, because I think it's interesting for us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2901.3s	2901.3	 to all learn about this together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2902.7s	2902.7	 So one thing is around the technology, which I'll talk about in a second,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2906.5s	2906.5	 which you just talked about and then previewed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2910.4s	2910.4	 And then the second is around the capital markets and the money flow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2913.9s	2913.9	 And that and this is a really big deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2915.9s	2915.9	 So what is a V.I.E.?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2918.2s	2918.2	 Because you're going to hear this a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2920.4s	2920.4	 A V.I.E. is what's called a variable interest entity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2924.7s	2924.7	 And what it is, is just a massive workaround.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2928.7s	2928.7	 So essentially what happened was a V.I.E.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2931.6s	2931.6	 was a legal business where, you know, an entity had control of a company,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2936.8s	2936.8	 OK, through a contract, but not through equity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2940.0s	2940.0	 So it's kind of like, you know, sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2941.7s	2941.7	 Like I had a contract with Colin that said I can dictate, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2945.7s	2945.7	 who does what, et cetera, but I don't own any equity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2948.5s	2948.5	 Now, the the company that completely ran a foul of all of these things was Enron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2953.2s	2953.2	 And back in 2001, Enron went fucking ham, as we all know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2957.9s	2957.9	 They had a bunch of these V.I.E.s and they used it to basically shield
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2961.9s	2961.9	 a bunch of losses and do a bunch of shady things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2964.7s	2964.7	 So then there was a bunch of accounting laws that were introduced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2967.6s	2967.6	 China. On a completely separate track around that same time was like, hey, listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2973.4s	2973.4	 we want to control our economy, so we're going to prohibit foreign ownership.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2976.6s	2976.6	 So just for all you guys to know, China to this day does not allow a foreigner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2981.6s	2981.6	 to own a piece, large sections of the Chinese economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2985.1s	2985.1	 OK, so as of 2018, which is the last updated list, as far as I could find it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2989.2s	2989.2	 there are 33 sectors of the economy where China says you cannot be a foreigner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2993.2s	2993.2	 and own any equity. You have to have a local partner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2997.2s	2997.2	 No, you cannot own any equity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=2998.7s	2998.7	 Yeah, exactly. If you want to start a business there, you have to have like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3001.3s	3001.3	 a partner like Yahoo did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3002.6s	3002.6	 So all technology companies fall under this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3005.1s	3005.1	 All data companies, any education company, any media company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3008.4s	3008.4	 So you can imagine it's basically every part of the economy that matters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3012.0s	3012.0	 And so because of all these restrictions, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3014.8s	3014.8	 the Chinese Internet companies were like, hey, hold on a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3017.1s	3017.1	 I need to get access to the capital markets. What do I do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3021.1s	3021.1	 They dusted off the structure and they basically created all of these,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3026.3s	3026.3	 you know, Cayman's holding companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3028.9s	3028.9	 And that's where all the American investors would go and buy equity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3032.8s	3032.8	 from or contribute equity to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3035.1s	3035.1	 And so, you know, Tencent, Alibaba, ByDude, DD.com, JD,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3039.2s	3039.2	 all of these folks have these VIEs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3042.6s	3042.6	 And what's interesting about these VIEs is it's written clear as day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3047.2s	3047.2	 but not a single investor seemed to care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3049.9s	3049.9	 But in the prospectuses of these Chinese companies, they were clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3053.2s	3053.2	 It doesn't mean you actually have a claim on the assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3055.6s	3055.6	 It doesn't mean you can actually make a demand of management.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3058.7s	3058.7	 I mean, if you saw this in an American prospectus,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3061.7s	3061.7	 you would not put a single dollar into these companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3064.7s	3064.7	 But in fact, the exact opposite happened because people were greedy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3068.6s	3068.6	 and chasing the money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3070.1s	3070.1	 And these risks, by the way, came back to bear because Jason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3074.1s	3074.1	 I think you were the one that gave the example of the Chinese tutoring guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3077.6s	3077.6	 where, you know, overnight, this guy lost 99 percent of his net worth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3081.4s	3081.4	 I think this was one or two pods ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3084.0s	3084.0	 The way they did that was that they canceled the VIEs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3086.8s	3086.8	 They said online tutoring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3088.1s	3088.1	 Nope, sorry, these things can't exist anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3091.4s	3091.4	 And so essentially, we have the situation now where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3095.6s	3095.6	 VIEs are part of 58 companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3101.0s	3101.0	 massive Chinese mega cap companies that are in the huge indexes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3104.4s	3104.4	 in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3105.9s	3105.9	 These 58 companies account for two trillion dollars a market cap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3109.0s	3109.0	 We are we are we are now in a situation now where the Chinese government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3112.4s	3112.4	 basically says for online tutoring, we're going to cancel the VIEs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3116.1s	3116.1	 in a bunch of other areas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3117.2s	3117.2	 We're going to start with regulation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3118.6s	3118.6	 We could cancel the VIEs later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3121.6s	3121.6	 And so we've essentially put the capital markets, in my opinion, on pause.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3126.1s	3126.1	 And so now let's transition to the markets in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3129.4s	3129.4	 Capital markets in China, I think now are the most volatile they've ever been.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3134.2s	3134.2	 Essentially, the People's Republic of China, the government, the CCP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3138.6s	3138.6	 chooses how and who will make money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3141.5s	3141.5	 And they are basically putting their foot down in a big way in the capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3145.7s	3145.7	 What happens to the one point six two trillion in existing shares
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3149.6s	3149.6	 that have been bought by people around the world?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3151.0s	3151.0	 Would there be some way to unravel that or attend or offer?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3154.6s	3154.6	 You're going to have to delist these ADRs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3156.4s	3156.4	 I don't exactly know what would happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3158.1s	3158.1	 I think what happened to the president, I mean, you have capital loss, Jason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3161.2s	3161.2	 because when they canceled the online tutoring, the stock prices
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3164.4s	3164.4	 basically went to zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3165.9s	3165.9	 So you could eviscerate two trillion dollars of market cap tomorrow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3169.1s	3169.1	 if they decide, you know what, that VIE for Alibaba, by the way, Nick,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3172.1s	3172.1	 I'll send it to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3173.2s	3173.2	 But it's a it's a thing of art.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3174.8s	3174.8	 If you look at the structure for Baba,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3177.8s	3177.8	 I mean, it is a fucking babushka doll of nesting entities and this or that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3182.7s	3182.7	 I don't know how any investor who bought shares in Alibaba
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3187.3s	3187.3	 actually took the time to understand what they were actually buying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3190.4s	3190.4	 They suspended disbelief because they were greedy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3193.2s	3193.2	 So so the point is that's happening. OK, so the the capital markets are now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3197.7s	3197.7	 I think, getting really constrained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3200.3s	3200.3	 The complement to this is that they're starting to now introduce legislation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3204.5s	3204.5	 as a prelude, in my opinion, to canceling some of these VIEs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3208.7s	3208.7	 in the most important area that we care about, which is tech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3211.4s	3211.4	 So, Jason, to your point, the Chinese cyberspace watchdog today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3216.1s	3216.1	 or yesterday, I think it was they just published a list of draft regulations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3221.0s	3221.0	 that will now become law.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3222.8s	3222.8	 I'm just going to read this to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3224.0s	3224.0	 So let me just just FYI for you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3227.0s	3227.0	 So let me just give you a sense of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3229.0s	3229.0	 Users must be provided with a convenient way to see and delete
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3232.3s	3232.3	 all the keywords that an algorithm uses to profile them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3235.8s	3235.8	 Number two, providers shall not have that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3238.8s	3238.8	 Providers shall not record illegal and undesirable keywords
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3242.7s	3242.7	 in the user points of interest or as user tags and push information
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3246.4s	3246.4	 content to them, and they may not become discriminatory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3250.5s	3250.5	 or biased based on that information.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3253.5s	3253.5	 Users must be informed that algorithms are being used on them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3257.0s	3257.0	 to recommend content or products to them, and they must be allowed to opt out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3261.2s	3261.2	 and see completely generic, non-personalized results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3265.1s	3265.1	 The algorithm recommendation shall adhere to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3268.6s	3268.6	 This is incredible to mainstream values.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3270.7s	3270.7	 I don't know what that means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3272.0s	3272.0	 They must have harmony in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3274.3s	3274.3	 They must actively spread positive energy and promote the application
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3277.8s	3277.8	 of algorithms for the better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3280.0s	3280.0	 Providers shall regularly review and evaluate and verify these algorithms,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3284.5s	3284.5	 models and data's with these watchdogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3287.9s	3287.9	 These watchdogs will now start to increasingly take board
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3291.0s	3291.0	 seats on the on on Chinese companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3293.4s	3293.4	 So you put these two things together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3295.7s	3295.7	 It is a takeover moment in China tech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3298.7s	3298.7	 It's a takeover. Yes, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3300.6s	3300.6	 I mean, so some of those provisions sound like, you know, privacy regulations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3305.0s	3305.0	 we might want to adopt over here completely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3307.6s	3307.6	 But I think we should focus on the one towards the end that you mentioned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3311.1s	3311.1	 The algorithm recommendation source provider shall adhere to mainstream values
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3314.6s	3314.6	 and actively spread positive energy and promote applications for the better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3319.1s	3319.1	 Now, how do you actively spread positive energy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3322.0s	3322.0	 I mean, as a business person under that regulation, like, what does that even mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3327.7s	3327.7	 I mean, it basically means it means what you're not spreading, David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3331.4s	3331.4	 It means you're not spreading a protest in Hong Kong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3334.5s	3334.5	 It means you're not talking about the Uyghurs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3336.5s	3336.5	 It means you're not talking about Tiananmen Square.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3338.6s	3338.6	 You're not creating social unrest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3340.3s	3340.3	 This is a way for them to say, you know, positive energy means
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3344.0s	3344.0	 don't criticize Xi Jinping or the CCP or bring up topics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3347.8s	3347.8	 that are in the no fly zone like the Uyghurs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3349.4s	3349.4	 Well, they're they're they're going to have content moderation guidelines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3351.8s	3351.8	 Yeah, they're bringing it all under their control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3353.6s	3353.6	 That's what it's about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3354.4s	3354.4	 I mean, this is the type of thing that despite all of our problems,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3357.7s	3357.7	 makes me very happy to be an American.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3360.2s	3360.2	 Yeah. Can you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3361.5s	3361.5	 I would say, though, that the first part of what I said about their regulations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3364.6s	3364.6	 to me, seem really intelligent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3365.9s	3365.9	 And I think Americans would want that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3367.5s	3367.5	 And if American policymakers would actually just suspend disbelief for a second,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3371.8s	3371.8	 go to the Chinese website, meet Nick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3373.8s	3373.8	 We can put a link into the into the show notes of where the regulations are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3376.6s	3376.6	 published and actually try to implement those laws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3379.2s	3379.2	 I think we as Americans, we'd all want most of them except that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3382.4s	3382.4	 Yeah, well, that's what the devil does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3383.7s	3383.7	 They mix the lies with the truth in order to get you to be convinced,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3387.2s	3387.2	 to give up your freedoms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3388.1s	3388.1	 Friedberg, what are your thoughts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3389.3s	3389.3	 I'm getting increasingly convinced that this idea of decentralized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3393.2s	3393.2	 blockchain based government governing might work in the 21st century.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3398.1s	3398.1	 I just feel like they're the you know, we keep hearing more about the overreach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3403.3s	3403.3	 and the ineptitude of centralized institutions like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3407.1s	3407.1	 CCP and the US government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3409.0s	3409.0	 And. You know, I'm not hearing anyone that says, man,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3413.4s	3413.4	 you know, this is a great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3415.7s	3415.7	 Well, I think the CCP is actually pretty good at what they do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3421.5s	3421.5	 We may not agree with them, but I think they're pretty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3423.3s	3423.3	 I agree with you. I agree with you generally. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3426.6s	3426.6	 But I do think it creates an incentive and a motivation also,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3429.5s	3429.5	 because if you don't agree with their principles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3434.0s	3434.0	 You know, you're going to find yourself looking for an alternative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3437.2s	3437.2	 So, you know, I don't know, this is probably not the right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3440.8s	3440.8	 time or forum for this conversation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3442.8s	3442.8	 We should probably do it on another show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3444.9s	3444.9	 But we should talk about some of the innovations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3448.3s	3448.3	 blockchain innovations that are taking place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3450.6s	3450.6	 And, Jake, I know you spent a lot of time on this as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3453.1s	3453.1	 But, you know, it'd be worth kind of talking about the notion that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3456.6s	3456.6	 you know, can you see governing move to the blockchain?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3461.1s	3461.1	 And what does society look like in maybe the 22nd century?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3464.2s	3464.2	 If this becomes a reality and how do we how does the world kind of evolve there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3468.1s	3468.1	 Well, in the crypto world, you would put in some effort.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3471.2s	3471.2	 You would have some skin in the game and you would because of your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3474.8s	3474.8	 processing power, your nodes on the network would get some votes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3477.6s	3477.6	 It would be like in a democracy, how much money you had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3481.4s	3481.4	 or how much work you produced, you had some sort of say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3484.3s	3484.3	 which kind of sounds like ours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3485.6s	3485.6	 I mean, imagine if the US government, instead of, you know, having some folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3489.7s	3489.7	 go to Congress and say, I want a trillion dollars and spend 25 years in Afghanistan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3495.4s	3495.4	 You know, it was more of a distributed decision making process
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3498.2s	3498.2	 where data was available in real time, metrics were used to make the decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3501.3s	3501.3	 And the folks that actually contributed dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3505.3s	3505.3	 to the network ended up being the ones that made the decisions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3507.9s	3507.9	 based on how many dollars they've contributed or based on some other principle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3510.7s	3510.7	 of decision making that doesn't kind of aggregate institutional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3515.2s	3515.2	 ineptitude, which is kind of part of the issue we've seen here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3519.0s	3519.0	 Well, so I think that brings up an interesting point, which is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3522.2s	3522.2	 you know, we talk about all the ways that we could have spent these trillions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3525.4s	3525.4	 of dollars better than nation building.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3527.4s	3527.4	 Here's the fundamental problem. I agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3529.2s	3529.2	 I mean, I wish we had spent the six trillion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3531.9s	3531.9	 that we spent on nation building in the Middle East.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3533.4s	3533.4	 I wish we had spent that at home domestically on our own priorities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3537.6s	3537.6	 But here's the problem is, I think what Afghanistan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3540.8s	3540.8	 and specifically the military industrial complex shows is how good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3544.4s	3544.4	 these special interests get at extracting money from the system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3547.8s	3547.8	 while providing so little value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3549.9s	3549.9	 You know, we spent so the these contractors spent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3553.6s	3553.6	 or they they charge so much to basically deliver so little on Afghanistan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3558.4s	3558.4	 Do you really think it's going to be much different for the trillion dollar,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3561.1s	3561.1	 the one point two trillion dollar infrastructure bill that's coming?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3564.3s	3564.3	 You know, and if we create it, they're licking their lips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3566.2s	3566.2	 They're looking. Yeah, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3568.0s	3568.0	 The people, the groups who are going to get that money,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3571.0s	3571.0	 who are going to feast on that trillion dollars are people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3574.4s	3574.4	 who their skill set is lobbying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3576.7s	3576.7	 OK, that is what they spend their time doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3579.2s	3579.2	 Sorry, I think it's backwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3580.6s	3580.6	 No, listen, and if you are really good at lobbying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3582.7s	3582.7	 why would you even waste your time trying to get good at delivering value?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3586.4s	3586.4	 You're not. That's your business's lobbying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3588.4s	3588.4	 That is your value. Yeah, that is your skill set.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3590.2s	3590.2	 Exactly. So this idea that we can basically spend a trillion dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3593.9s	3593.9	 on some domestic innovation program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3596.8s	3596.8	 The problem is, it'll never go to the right people, never go to the innovators.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3602.0s	3602.0	 The best thing we could do is not spend the money, quite frankly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3605.7s	3605.7	 So smaller government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3608.3s	3608.3	 Or how about how about just not a government that's 20 trillion dollars in debt?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3612.0s	3612.0	 I don't know how it's like smaller or small government to if we were to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3616.3s	3616.3	 save six trillion would still be 14 trillion in debt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3619.4s	3619.4	 It's not a small government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3620.5s	3620.5	 I think the good jumping off point here might be the Supreme Court
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3624.6s	3624.6	 eviction moratorium and the Supreme Court not upholding it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3629.0s	3629.0	 And what are your thoughts on that, Sax?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3631.0s	3631.0	 Because it does relate to this never ending free money train,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3634.7s	3634.7	 no repercussions of personal behavior and, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3639.8s	3639.8	 spending insanely forever, it seems like we're never going to stop with the stimmies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3646.2s	3646.2	 Yeah, I think the Supreme Court threw out Biden's eviction moratorium
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3650.6s	3650.6	 as unconstitutional. Look, I think it's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3654.0s	3654.0	 You know, the government should not be preventing eviction,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3659.3s	3659.3	 you know, especially not the federal government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3660.6s	3660.6	 I don't understand how this is supposed to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3662.0s	3662.0	 I mean, all you do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3663.8s	3663.8	 Look, I don't want to see anybody get evicted, but the reality is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3666.5s	3666.5	 you have to pay your rent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3667.5s	3667.5	 And if and if there are groups of people who can't pay their rent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3671.4s	3671.4	 and the government decides that that those people should be helped,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3675.0s	3675.0	 the right way to help them is to give them the money to pay their rent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3677.9s	3677.9	 not just to tell landlords, sorry, like you can't collect rent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3681.4s	3681.4	 Congress could give more stimulus to those people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3683.7s	3683.7	 Yes, it's a taking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3685.6s	3685.6	 It's a clear taking from landlords to say that, oh, your tenants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3689.3s	3689.3	 don't have to pay you anymore. How does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3691.4s	3691.4	 Well, how do we unwind the free money train?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3694.5s	3694.5	 Because there's 10 million job openings right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3697.3s	3697.3	 that are not getting filled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3699.2s	3699.2	 And then we have unemployment starting to unwind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3702.2s	3702.2	 or the bonus unemployment are on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3703.9s	3703.9	 And then we have all this free rent concept or just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3707.0s	3707.0	 you don't have to pay your rent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3708.5s	3708.5	 At some point, it feels like we have to let the free market come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3714.8s	3714.8	 And maybe people can't pay their rent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3716.6s	3716.6	 So they go take one of the 10 million jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3719.5s	3719.5	 I know that sounds cold hearted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3721.3s	3721.3	 No, it's some point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3722.4s	3722.4	 There has to be some lending.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3723.9s	3723.9	 You've talked about this before in California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3725.5s	3725.5	 We have a labor shortage in California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3728.3s	3728.3	 We've basically run a controlled experiment in the UBI,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3731.7s	3731.7	 Universal Basic Income, where we've basically been paying people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3734.9s	3734.9	 not to work or paying them in regards to whether they work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3737.2s	3737.2	 Guess what? They don't take jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3739.3s	3739.3	 And so we actually have a labor shortage in California
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3741.5s	3741.5	 despite having high unemployment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3743.7s	3743.7	 At some point, the government's going to have to say to people like, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3747.4s	3747.4	 COVID is not an excuse for shirking your adult responsibilities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3751.7s	3751.7	 You know, we all have a responsibility to go to work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3754.6s	3754.6	 to pay our rent, you know, to pay our parking tickets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3758.4s	3758.4	 And COVID has been this excuse for suspending, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3761.7s	3761.7	 this sort of normal life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3763.4s	3763.4	 And the problem is, COVID is going to be around forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3765.8s	3765.8	 It's like the cold or the flu.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3767.6s	3767.6	 It can't continue to be this excuse for people not working,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3770.3s	3770.3	 not paying rent, not doing what they're supposed to be doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3772.7s	3772.7	 I think on top of that, though, I think, Jason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3774.7s	3774.7	 maybe you want to talk about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3776.0s	3776.0	 I think on top of that, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3778.5s	3778.5	 are amplifying that by taking people's agency away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3782.3s	3782.3	 And we are. Prop 22.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3784.7s	3784.7	 And Prop 22 is a perfect example of that, which you should talk about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3787.8s	3787.8	 But when you put these two things together, on the one hand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3790.1s	3790.1	 you have a government that basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3792.5s	3792.5	 wants to subsidize opting out of the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3796.9s	3796.9	 And then you have a set of laws that if they're not unwound,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3801.6s	3801.6	 reinforce that dynamic and you put these two things together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3805.0s	3805.0	 and folks just want to sit on the sidelines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3807.2s	3807.2	 Yeah, let's get free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3808.3s	3808.3	 But you want to talk about the Prop 22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3811.7s	3811.7	 Supreme Court decision, et cetera?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3814.3s	3814.3	 Yeah, there was an appeals court,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3816.2s	3816.2	 appeals court, appeals court that overturned some elements of the California
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3821.4s	3821.4	 Prop 22, which was a heavily lobbied California proposition,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3826.3s	3826.3	 lobbied by Uber and Lyft and other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3830.1s	3830.1	 businesses that have built effectively marketplaces for independent contractors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3834.2s	3834.2	 like drivers and delivery people and so on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3837.0s	3837.0	 The SEIU, which is a big employees union,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3840.9s	3840.9	 had, you know, fought very hard to pass legislation in California
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3845.2s	3845.2	 that made it effectively very difficult for people to operate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3849.2s	3849.2	 as independent contractors, enforcing companies like Uber and Lyft
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3851.9s	3851.9	 to treat them like full time employees or to treat them like employees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3855.7s	3855.7	 And so Prop 22 was to counter the union funded legislation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3862.1s	3862.1	 which basically provided more freedom and flexibility to workers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3865.3s	3865.3	 where there weren't all these very arbitrary random rules
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3867.6s	3867.6	 that if you're a writer, you can be an independent contractor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3869.8s	3869.8	 But if you're a driver, you cannot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3871.2s	3871.2	 You know, all this nonsense that took place because the unions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3873.9s	3873.9	 were trying to increase the scale and scope of their union base.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3879.1s	3879.1	 And so Prop 22 was passed in California after much spending and lobbying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3883.1s	3883.1	 and it passed by a pretty decent margin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3885.3s	3885.3	 And then this court ruling basically in the appeals court overruled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3889.3s	3889.3	 the constitutionality of some elements of Prop 22, which brings into question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3892.9s	3892.9	 whether that Prop 22 is actually going to hold in California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3895.8s	3895.8	 Therefore, are all these people who are drivers for Uber,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3898.7s	3898.7	 delivery people for DoorDash and all these companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3902.5s	3902.5	 that are creating like thumbtack and all these companies that are creating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3906.2s	3906.2	 marketplaces for individuals to have flexible work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3909.5s	3909.5	 to go and work where they want, when they want to find gigs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3912.8s	3912.8	 to find short term jobs, to find tasks and projects that they can run.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3918.4s	3918.4	 Are they now going to be seeing that those marketplaces stop working?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3922.3s	3922.3	 Because when you have to start treating those people like employees,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3924.9s	3924.9	 the flexibility and freedom that those marketplaces enable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3927.8s	3927.8	 stalls out and kind of, as we're already seeing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3930.4s	3930.4	 So it's super nasty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3931.8s	3931.8	 And the implications are that we're now seeing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3936.6s	3936.6	 you know, we're now facing once again this crisis of, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3940.0s	3940.0	 are basically lower income people, people that want to have flexible labor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3944.8s	3944.8	 going to be restricted from having access to gig jobs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3949.0s	3949.0	 because the unions want to force everyone into a full time job,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3951.7s	3951.7	 which, you know, as our friend Bill Gurley pointed out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3953.8s	3953.8	 it's kind of like an archaic element of, yeah, the 19th and 20th century.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3957.2s	3957.2	 I mean, this is like a old school way of work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3959.3s	3959.3	 Let's play a clip from Bill Gurley and here it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3961.8s	3961.8	 There's one big issue that I don't think is talked about enough, which is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3966.2s	3966.2	 you know, that if you polled the drivers, they're not looking for any changes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3970.9s	3970.9	 They're really happy with the flexible work product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3973.8s	3973.8	 If you look at the voters of California, they stepped up and voted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3977.2s	3977.2	 and made it very clear in a state that voted two to one,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3981.2s	3981.2	 you know, in favor of Biden, they came down very strong, 60, 40,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3985.5s	3985.5	 that they didn't want this to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3987.3s	3987.3	 And there's one entity that's really been pushing this the whole time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3992.1s	3992.1	 going all the way back to 85.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3994.0s	3994.0	 And that's the SEIU.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3995.8s	3995.8	 It is a single union.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=3997.5s	3997.5	 But to call them a single union understates it because they are the granddaddy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4001.3s	4001.3	 of special interest groups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4002.5s	4002.5	 I sent along some data, maybe you can put on the screen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4005.8s	4005.8	 They spend more money lobbying than any other organization in our country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4011.0s	4011.0	 and have for many, many years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4013.2s	4013.2	 They only represent two million members, but oddly, those members
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4017.3s	4017.3	 are in hospitality, health care and government services.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4020.0s	4020.0	 They're not even in this industry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4022.0s	4022.0	 So they're taking the dues from their members and using it to fight these battles
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4026.9s	4026.9	 because they want to expand their footprint.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4029.0s	4029.0	 What they're really after is putting four hundred dollars, four hundred
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4032.8s	4032.8	 twenty dollars, which is the minimum member union fee for the two million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4036.8s	4036.8	 they have. They want to expand that to these drivers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4039.5s	4039.5	 So they don't actually want to help them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4041.2s	4041.2	 They want to add to their costs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4043.6s	4043.6	 But they're the they're the they're the one that's been pushing this the whole time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4047.0s	4047.0	 And I think it's worth just saying one thing on this, which is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4051.0s	4051.0	 you know, this is really kind of a question, not about California and Prop 22,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4056.9s	4056.9	 but it's a question about what is work and all the tech companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4060.4s	4060.4	 that are enabling a new form of work globally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4063.4s	4063.4	 People don't want to have 40 hour a week jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4066.1s	4066.1	 People don't want to have to go sit at a desk all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4068.2s	4068.2	 People want to have flexibility in their lives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4069.9s	4069.9	 They want to have gigs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4071.1s	4071.1	 Technology enables us to quickly find short term jobs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4073.9s	4073.9	 short term opportunities to work on things and make some money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4076.8s	4076.8	 and figure out how we want to build our lives in a more flexible way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4079.6s	4079.6	 figure out how workers want to build lives in a more flexible way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4082.0s	4082.0	 across all industries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4083.7s	4083.7	 And it's really, frankly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4087.2s	4087.2	 you know, a non progressive policy to say that everyone has to be pigeonholed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4093.1s	4093.1	 into working, you know, full time, 40 hour a week labor jobs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4097.2s	4097.2	 be employees and not have the flexibility of running their own business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4100.3s	4100.3	 in their own way with their own time and choosing what they want to go do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4104.0s	4104.0	 and work on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4105.2s	4105.2	 And so this sort of legislation and this sort of battle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4108.4s	4108.4	 is a really important one for defining the future of work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4111.3s	4111.3	 in the United States, which will ultimately represent the future of work globally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4114.9s	4114.9	 And the craziness of all this, David, is that Uber drivers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4118.6s	4118.6	 Lyft drivers, door to drivers, etc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4120.6s	4120.6	 are getting paid a fortune now because there's a labor shortage and.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4124.5s	4124.5	 These ride sharing companies have given a minimum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4128.4s	4128.4	 twenty one dollar an hour fee, so I don't know exactly what's going on here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4134.5s	4134.5	 but it seems to me like it's a union grab because everybody else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4138.1s	4138.1	 who's affluent or rich, real estate folks, you know, doctors, whoever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4144.1s	4144.1	 Can be freelance, but if you're a ride share driver or a freelance writer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4150.1s	4150.1	 you don't get to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4152.5s	4152.5	 And it seems just incredibly unfair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4155.6s	4155.6	 It is. And, you know, one of the best things about Covid,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4158.0s	4158.0	 I think for all of us is that we learned that we could do our jobs from anywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4162.0s	4162.0	 We didn't have to go into an office.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4163.6s	4163.6	 We didn't have to work the standard, whatever, nine to six hours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4166.4s	4166.4	 We could be anywhere. We had flexibility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4169.0s	4169.0	 And I mean, I think it's one of the lasting consequences of Covid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4171.8s	4171.8	 that's actually been very positive for a lot of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4174.1s	4174.1	 And here you have the government basically trying to take away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4177.3s	4177.3	 and prohibit freelance work, flexible hours, gig type jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4182.2s	4182.2	 These are the sort of modern, flexible working relationships that people want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4186.0s	4186.0	 Why are they getting rid of it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4187.2s	4187.2	 Because a lobbying pressure from the SEIU, which only has two million members,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4191.5s	4191.5	 is not even a big union.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4192.8s	4192.8	 But they got Lorena Gonzalez in their back pocket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4195.4s	4195.4	 She passed AB five in California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4197.5s	4197.5	 The people of California didn't want it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4199.2s	4199.2	 Remember, 58 percent of Californians said we don't want this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4204.2s	4204.2	 So they overturned in this ballot initiative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4206.2s	4206.2	 And now you got this activist judge basically, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4210.3s	4210.3	 inventing these specious grounds for overturning Prop 22,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4214.0s	4214.0	 which is what the people want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4215.2s	4215.2	 So it's ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4217.0s	4217.0	 And, you know, the common thread to me on this show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4219.8s	4219.8	 that I've come to realize about American politics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4222.9s	4222.9	 is just the degree of special interest corruption.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4225.6s	4225.6	 And, you know, people are used to thinking in terms of left versus right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4228.2s	4228.2	 It's not. There's a special interest corruption that pervades everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4231.6s	4231.6	 You've got this union that is destroying freelance work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4235.4s	4235.4	 and flexible working relationships because of corruption, because it benefits them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4238.7s	4238.7	 You got defense contractors in Afghanistan who are just looting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4242.8s	4242.8	 looting the Pentagon and the federal budget because it's in their interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4246.0s	4246.0	 You've got these special interests of both the right and the left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4248.6s	4248.6	 This is the central problem in American politics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4250.7s	4250.7	 And, you know, what they do to cover up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4253.5s	4253.5	 the naked self-interest is they disguise it in a kind of woke virtue signaling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4258.2s	4258.2	 So they'll start talking about, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4261.5s	4261.5	 how what they're doing is for the benefit of these drivers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4264.3s	4264.3	 when the drivers don't even want it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4266.0s	4266.0	 And to build on that, I'd say, you know, my great realization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4269.6s	4269.6	 from having this conversation with you all every week is that we are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4273.9s	4273.9	 starting to propose a nanny state in which people have no agency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4278.4s	4278.4	 Even if they want to have agency over their life and career, you are taking it away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4283.1s	4283.1	 And then if there's no repercussions to people's behavior and they have no agency,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4287.5s	4287.5	 they become, you know, disenfranchised from society.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4292.0s	4292.0	 And why are they going to participate?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4294.1s	4294.1	 And then what kind of society do we have if people can't make their own choices?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4298.8s	4298.8	 And you see it also in, you know, accreditation laws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4302.8s	4302.8	 And you see it where only rich people can invest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4305.1s	4305.1	 And now you're seeing it with this freelancing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4307.0s	4307.0	 We're you know, my dad would have loved to have an extra shift or two to make extra money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4312.2s	4312.2	 And he's not allowed to 80 percent of drivers want flexibility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4316.6s	4316.6	 They're willing to participate on things that ultimately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4322.3s	4322.3	 on things that they think matter, but don't necessarily solve the core root cause problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4327.6s	4327.6	 There are people right now in America, I think, are focused too much on symptoms,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4331.8s	4331.8	 meaning, you know, they want to fight for the right hashtags.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4335.8s	4335.8	 They want to fight for the right pronouns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4337.5s	4337.5	 They want to make sure that, you know, this person gets canceled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4340.4s	4340.4	 for things that happened eight or ten years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4343.3s	4343.3	 And I think what they don't understand is these are all symptoms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4346.9s	4346.9	 And this is this is not what solves the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4351.2s	4351.2	 Right. We have a water crisis in America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4354.6s	4354.6	 We have a food impending food crisis as we shut off the water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4359.9s	4359.9	 We have a climate crisis that's engulfed the entire nation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4364.3s	4364.3	 We're still in the middle of a pandemic that we can't control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4368.6s	4368.6	 We have an economic system that's fragile, that's dependent on a country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4373.2s	4373.2	 who's sometimes our friend and sometimes our foe in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4376.8s	4376.8	 These are huge transformational issues that we can't get organized around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4382.0s	4382.0	 And so instead, we spend our time at the edges on the symptoms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4385.9s	4385.9	 And we think the symptoms are if we get the pronouns right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4388.2s	4388.2	 everything's going to come together and everything's going to get fixed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4391.0s	4391.0	 The looting will stop. The graft will stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4393.4s	4393.4	 The corruption will stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4394.8s	4394.8	 And it turns out, actually, it emboldens those people to say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4398.9s	4398.9	 hey, wait a minute, I'm tricking these people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4401.5s	4401.5	 If they think that I want it to happen, can happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4403.6s	4403.6	 Let them focus on the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4405.2s	4405.2	 Let them focus on the pronouns while I continue to loot the American Treasury
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4408.6s	4408.6	 for another trillion dollars. That's where we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4411.3s	4411.3	 Yeah. And the perfect, the perfect representation of that is Gavin Newsom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4414.3s	4414.3	 He represents both of these trends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4416.2s	4416.2	 He is one of the most corrupt governors we ever had.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4418.3s	4418.3	 There were as soon as Covid happened, they suspended all sorts of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4423.3s	4423.3	 you know, the process for contracting so that his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4428.0s	4428.0	 campaign contributors could get all these special contracts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4430.8s	4430.8	 He cut a sweetheart deal to PG&E to absolve them of liability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4434.2s	4434.2	 for all the fires they've been causing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4435.9s	4435.9	 And on and on it goes that the 12 billion dollars, the homeless industrial complex,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4440.2s	4440.2	 and then he disguises it with all this woke virtue signaling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4443.2s	4443.2	 And so, you know, I would just give a shout out to the recall campaign.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4451.7s	4451.7	 that this special interest corruption has got to stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4454.9s	4454.9	 Let's cut the head off the snake here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4456.6s	4456.6	 Just vote to recall Gavin Newsom on question one. Period.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4460.4s	4460.4	 All right. You guys want to end on Jeff Bezos?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4464.1s	4464.1	 Let's let's let's talk about the AI bot first and then Bezos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4467.9s	4467.9	 All right. So if you haven't been watching,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4471.0s	4471.0	 Boston Dynamics tweeted a video which will play right now as I talk over it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4476.2s	4476.2	 And it's basically their robots, which have been picking up heavy objects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4481.8s	4481.8	 and walking around doing parkour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4484.4s	4484.4	 If you don't know what parkour is, it's basically people jumping off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4487.1s	4487.1	 the side of objects and flipping and doing balance beams
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4490.4s	4490.4	 and vaulting themselves all around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4491.9s	4491.9	 It is. Basically, it's like dancing in France.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4497.8s	4497.8	 Yeah, but from heights and jumping over things as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4500.2s	4500.2	 And the French are like parkour experts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4503.2s	4503.2	 Yeah, I mean, it's I think parkour is French for jumping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4506.8s	4506.8	 I made that up. But it's hard for you to look at these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4510.9s	4510.9	 Do parkour? No, absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4515.0s	4515.0	 I have never seen him. We'll show that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4517.2s	4517.2	 I have seen him so drunk that he's on the floor, but never seen him do parkour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4522.7s	4522.7	 But don't get in the way of sacks in a bottle of DRC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4527.5s	4527.5	 This robot looks more dexterous than any of the Terminators we saw in the films.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4533.2s	4533.2	 And then adding to that, oh, if you didn't know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4535.3s	4535.3	 Boston Dynamics got bought by Google.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4537.2s	4537.2	 I'm sure Freeberg has some insight information on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4539.2s	4539.2	 And then they got sold again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4541.5s	4541.5	 SoftBank had bought them and now they are owned by Hyundai,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4545.7s	4545.7	 the South Korean Hyundai, the South Korean automaker, because apparently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4550.4s	4550.4	 the. Softies at Google didn't want to be involved in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4556.0s	4556.0	 government contracting with robots, i.e. making soldiers of the future,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4559.5s	4559.5	 which obviously I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4561.3s	4561.3	 The Chinese have. I wouldn't characterize the whole story like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4564.2s	4564.2	 I mean, remember, like there was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4566.5s	4566.5	 Well, Google bought Boston Dynamics in 2013.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4570.5s	4570.5	 And remember, Boston Dynamics had been around for over a decade prior to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4574.1s	4574.1	 They spun out of MIT, like in the 90s, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4577.6s	4577.6	 And they had always been working on, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4579.9s	4579.9	 advanced neural nets being applied to kind of, you know, automation systems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4583.5s	4583.5	 so you could get things to mimic real life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4587.5s	4587.5	 And the idea at Google, this was when they had set up Google
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4590.9s	4590.9	 X and were starting to kind of do a lot of this, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4594.7s	4594.7	 moonshot type tech tech investing as a separate entity outside of the core.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4599.2s	4599.2	 Google and it was like leveraging their cash flow to start new projects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4602.5s	4602.5	 The idea was, let's, you know, build this into kind of a next gen robotics platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4607.8s	4607.8	 They had Andy Rubin, who previously started and ran Android.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4612.0s	4612.0	 Company was called Danger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4613.0s	4613.0	 Google bought it, turned into Android, run the run the unit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4616.6s	4616.6	 And they made several other acquisitions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4618.4s	4618.4	 They rolled them all up into this kind of robotics platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4621.4s	4621.4	 They had spent, I think, 400 million on Boston Dynamics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4624.2s	4624.2	 and hundreds of millions more on these other companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4627.1s	4627.1	 And ultimately, I think the challenge was less about like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4629.8s	4629.8	 who does or doesn't want to do contracts with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4632.2s	4632.2	 But it was more about the fundamental question that is still the question mark today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4637.2s	4637.2	 Which is, do we really need general purpose automation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4640.6s	4640.6	 or do we need special purpose automation for industries, for customers?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4644.6s	4644.6	 Right. Where do you find product market fit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4646.6s	4646.6	 Do people really need a robot that does parkour?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4649.4s	4649.4	 Or do they need an automation system that can lift boxes and pack and placings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4653.6s	4653.6	 or an automation system that can move things from point A to point B?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4656.8s	4656.8	 And so if you're solving for a customer's problem,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4659.4s	4659.4	 you typically find that the special purpose automation solution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4662.3s	4662.3	 is a more elegant, cheaper solution that you can get to market right away,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4666.8s	4666.8	 like building an automated little truck that moves things around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4669.7s	4669.7	 or building a machine that lifts and puts boxes in the right place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4672.6s	4672.6	 Parallel to the discussion between narrow AI and general AI.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4676.1s	4676.1	 Correct. And this is exactly the same question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4678.0s	4678.0	 J. Cal is like, you know, is, you know, is general purpose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4681.9s	4681.9	 AI really what the market needs or are there specific applications
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4686.4s	4686.4	 of neural network or machine learning technologies that allow us to solve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4690.4s	4690.4	 for the problems that customers have without needing to replicate the human being.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4695.0s	4695.0	 So when you're lifting boxes, you don't necessarily need all the other things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4697.8s	4697.8	 that humans have, right? You don't need to mimic a human.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4700.6s	4700.6	 When you're moving a package, you don't necessarily need to have four legs to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4704.2s	4704.2	 You can have it on four wheels and just have a simple system that moves it around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4708.2s	4708.2	 And so, you know, I think SoftBank, you know, Masa Sun had this whole belief
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4712.2s	4712.2	 with Vision Fund One when he raised 100 some odd billion dollars that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4715.8s	4715.8	 you know, the singularity where machines were going to be smarter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4718.2s	4718.2	 and better than humans in every way, intelligence and dexterity and all these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4721.9s	4721.9	 were about was about to kind of we're about to pass that moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4725.2s	4725.2	 And this was part of that core thesis he had, which is this is going to be the robotics company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4730.0s	4730.0	 And I think as we've seen, they can mimic parkour,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4733.4s	4733.4	 but they can't do all the other things humans can do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4735.8s	4735.8	 And if you're, you know, trying to get a machine to do something that a customer needs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4739.0s	4739.0	 it's really not parkour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4740.3s	4740.3	 Let's be honest, they can't even walk a dog because they know how to deal with the edge cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4745.1s	4745.1	 If the dog had diarrhea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4746.3s	4746.3	 And so I think there's core IP at Boston Dynamics that's certainly critically valuable for businesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4752.0s	4752.0	 that are in special purpose automation, which Hyundai is, there's going to be a great set of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4755.8s	4755.8	 applications for leveraging that IP into some of the existing product lines and customers that they serve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4760.9s	4760.9	 So in related in a related story, Elon then revealed the Tesla bot plans at his AI day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4767.0s	4767.0	 He's in a couple of his AI days, and I think they're primarily designed to get AI talent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4772.7s	4772.7	 which is some of the hardest developers to find in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4776.0s	4776.0	 And they said that their Tesla bot will weigh 125 pounds, five eight,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4780.5s	4780.5	 so I'll be a half inch taller than it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4783.0s	4783.0	 But it will weigh significantly less than me and it will move up to five miles per hour
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4787.4s	4787.4	 and can carry 45 pounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4789.5s	4789.5	 Elon said the reason he was doing that is so a human can easily overtake it in case it becomes sentient,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4794.6s	4794.6	 which was quite entertaining.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4796.9s	4796.9	 Chamath, you think this is one of the chances Elon has a robot like this and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4802.3s	4802.3	 it's operating in the real world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4803.4s	4803.4	 I saw a bunch of journalists dunking on him that this would never ever happen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4807.8s	4807.8	 which is kind of hard to believe when there's a million testers on the road.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4810.9s	4810.9	 Yeah, no comment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4811.9s	4811.9	 And I think it's awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4813.5s	4813.5	 Oh, okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4814.2s	4814.2	 Can't comment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4815.0s	4815.0	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4815.3s	4815.3	 Leave it at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4816.6s	4816.6	 Sachs, you have any comments on this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4819.1s	4819.1	 Um, I was with Elon at PayPal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4821.5s	4821.5	 Yeah, I thought it was a little bit of a surprise that he was working on a robot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4825.8s	4825.8	 But, you know, obviously this has been an interest of his.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4828.3s	4828.3	 He's talked a lot about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4829.7s	4829.7	 And so it kind of makes sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4832.2s	4832.2	 It's just another innovative thing he's doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4834.3s	4834.3	 Should we talk about Elon versus Bezos on the space thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4837.0s	4837.0	 Yeah, well, wait a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4838.2s	4838.2	 I just wanted to let people know, by the way, the robot going at five miles an hour,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4841.5s	4841.5	 it's not as outlandish as I think some of the journalists and idiots out there who don't build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4845.7s	4845.7	 anything in the world who were kind of dunking on him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4848.2s	4848.2	 Like we're saying, if you think about those cars going 65, 75, 85 miles an hour on the road,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4854.7s	4854.7	 processing the world, doing a neural network machine learning on the fly to figure out where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4859.3s	4859.3	 the car should go, a robot going five miles an hour is an easier task.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4864.2s	4864.2	 I think all those people dunking on him should have just taken a step back and actually asked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4868.2s	4868.2	 the question, am I just being really insecure right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4870.9s	4870.9	 And if so, why am I making fun of this guy who just seems to be, you know, firing on all cylinders?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4878.5s	4878.5	 And maybe it's maybe it's me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4881.0s	4881.0	 Maybe, you know, maybe, maybe, maybe I'm writing this article out of my own insecurity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4885.2s	4885.2	 Maybe I'm feeling a little impotent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4888.2s	4888.2	 And also to dunk on a guy for the version one or even the version 0.1 of a product is so ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4895.4s	4895.4	 I mean, I remember the version zero of Tesla.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4898.6s	4898.6	 Now look at the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4899.8s	4899.8	 I mean, you know, it's about iterating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4902.1s	4902.1	 That's how you get to product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4903.4s	4903.4	 So it's just so stupid and short term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4905.5s	4905.5	 And by the way, the current product capabilities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4908.2s	4908.2	 And his style of doing these things, I think makes a ton of sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4912.1s	4912.1	 When, you know, he started with Starlink, it was the same reaction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4915.0s	4915.0	 People were dunking, dunking, dunking too slow, too expensive, not going to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4919.1s	4919.1	 And what you find through these events are really technical people building companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4924.8s	4924.8	 that could help him want to be a part of the mission.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4928.2s	4928.2	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4928.8s	4928.8	 And so, you know, for whatever it's worth, it's like, I think Starlink is going to be a real thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4932.7s	4932.7	 I think this is probably going to be a real thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4936.1s	4936.1	 I think great companies will get absorbed into this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4939.4s	4939.4	 These efforts, I think, I think it's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4941.6s	4941.6	 And I really think the people that are just so low, like, there's like this loathing going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4949.2s	4949.2	 I just don't understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4950.2s	4950.2	 Chamath, what do you think will differentiate the opportunity for success
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4956.4s	4956.4	 with Larry Page owning and running Boston Dynamics,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4960.7s	4960.7	 then Masa owning and running Boston Dynamics,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4962.7s	4962.7	 and then Elon trying to take on the same project from scratch?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4966.5s	4966.5	 You know, why were these other two kind of well-capitalized, influential
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4971.0s	4971.0	 businesses that have attract great partners,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4973.2s	4973.2	 not been able to turn Boston Dynamics into kind of a successful business,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4976.6s	4976.6	 but you guys believe Elon will?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4979.0s	4979.0	 If I had to just categorize them, I would say Larry is absent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4983.6s	4983.6	 and is sitting on a hundred billion dollar fortune with no idea what to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4988.2s	4988.2	 I think Masa is-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4988.6s	4988.6	 On one of seven islands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4990.3s	4990.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4990.7s	4990.7	 I mean, he's just absent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4992.4s	4992.4	 So he's irrelevant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4994.5s	4994.5	 I don't think anybody knows what the fuck he looks like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4997.5s	4997.5	 I mean, we do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=4999.1s	4999.1	 But, you know, he's frittered away enormous potential, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5003.0s	5003.0	 I think Masa is a master capital allocator, but not an engineer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5007.8s	5007.8	 And I think Elon is the most important technical product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5011.7s	5011.7	 and business mind of our lifetime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5013.1s	5013.1	 I think the answer is even simpler.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5014.6s	5014.6	 He's the customer of the robot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5016.5s	5016.5	 So he understands what the spec should be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5018.6s	5018.6	 because he has so many robots working in the factories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5021.4s	5021.4	 So he's going to buy the first thousand to go colonize Mars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5025.1s	5025.1	 or work at a space station to build shit in space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5027.4s	5027.4	 And he's going to have them working in the Tesla factory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5029.8s	5029.8	 and for the boring company carrying rocks out of towns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5032.4s	5032.4	 He's the customer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5033.3s	5033.3	 Of course he knows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5034.4s	5034.4	 And Masa wasn't the customer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5035.6s	5035.6	 Masa was looking to increase whatever money he had on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5039.7s	5039.7	 But it's also skill set.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5041.9s	5041.9	 Like Masa is an incredible visionary and investor,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5044.7s	5044.7	 but he's not going to be the guy in the engine room making the robot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5048.6s	5048.6	 Larry, now in fairness to Larry Page, he could be that good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5052.1s	5052.1	 And there was a moment in time where Larry was that good and frankly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5055.7s	5055.7	 better than Elon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5057.6s	5057.6	 But that window has closed and it's well passed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5059.8s	5059.8	 And now it's kind of like the player that just keeps getting better and better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5063.0s	5063.0	 I think that's Elon Musk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5064.3s	5064.3	 Go ahead, Zach, your thoughts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5065.9s	5065.9	 I mean, nothing to add to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5067.0s	5067.0	 I think you both make great points.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5068.2s	5068.2	 I mean, the amazing thing is that Elon is still working so hard,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5071.4s	5071.4	 doubling down, coming up with new ideas, new initiatives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5074.2s	5074.2	 I mean, it's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5075.6s	5075.6	 When most people are doing, most people would do what Larry did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5079.7s	5079.7	 Go buy an island.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5080.6s	5080.6	 Or seven.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5082.6s	5082.6	 And hang out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5084.8s	5084.8	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5085.2s	5085.2	 Bezos is lost his way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5088.1s	5088.1	 And he left his position as CEO of Amazon to focus on Blue Origin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5093.3s	5093.3	 And then he sued NASA over the moon program, accusing NASA of wrongly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5099.2s	5099.2	 evaluated its lunar lander proposal, giving all the funds to SpaceX.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5104.0s	5104.0	 He then did a series of like infographics talking about how terrible SpaceX's plans were.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5110.7s	5110.7	 This lawsuit has delayed SpaceX's work on the project according to the Verge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5114.0s	5114.0	 I don't know if that's true or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5115.5s	5115.5	 Amazon urged the FCC to dismiss the newly submitted plans for SpaceX to launch another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5121.1s	5121.1	 cluster of satellites to power Starlink.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5125.8s	5125.8	 And Elon tweeted, turns out Bezos retired in order to pursue a full-time job filing lawsuits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5132.5s	5132.5	 against SpaceX, which is hilarious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5137.5s	5137.5	 How sad is this that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5138.8s	5138.8	 It's a huge miscalculation in the following way, which is that in order for Jeff to achieve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5143.8s	5143.8	 his ambitions, he needs deeply technical people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5147.0s	5147.0	 And this is the simplest way to basically turn them off because this is not what technical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5152.1s	5152.1	 people do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5153.0s	5153.0	 What do technical people do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5154.4s	5154.4	 We don't take our toys and run from the sandbox crying like a bitch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5158.5s	5158.5	 We stay there and we keep iterating trying to make things work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5161.4s	5161.4	 Yeah. We don't act like patent trolls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5163.8s	5163.8	 I have a new slogan for you, J Cal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5166.2s	5166.2	 Go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5166.9s	5166.9	 Winners do and losers sue.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5173.2s	5173.2	 It's the all in podcast.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5179.0s	5179.0	 Yeah, make the banger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5180.1s	5180.1	 Make a banger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5181.3s	5181.3	 All right, everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5182.2s	5182.2	 What's your free bird?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5183.0s	5183.0	 Do you have any thoughts on these lawsuits?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5185.4s	5185.4	 I feel bad for Bezos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5186.6s	5186.6	 I feel like he's just getting so beat up on this shit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5188.7s	5188.7	 It's honestly, it's a little disappointing because I think he's got all the right intentions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5193.1s	5193.1	 He's an incredible engineer, obviously an incredible operator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5195.5s	5195.5	 I'd love to see him and Elon succeed in the work they're trying to do as well as all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5200.2s	5200.2	 other startups that are pursuing this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5202.3s	5202.3	 I am concerned about, frankly, the lack of commercial readiness for this industry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5206.5s	5206.5	 I feel like in terms of the hype cycle, we're at that early point where the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5211.4s	5211.4	 investment dollars and the number of companies exceeds the market demand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5215.5s	5215.5	 Therefore, there's this fight over the one or two customers, which is basically NASA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5220.4s	5220.4	 and the federal government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5221.8s	5221.8	 It's creating this really nasty set of circumstances because that's where the money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5225.9s	5225.9	 comes from. That's where the customers are right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5228.8s	5228.8	 They're all fighting over one or two customers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5231.1s	5231.1	 Elon filed suits against federal agencies when he lost contracts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5237.4s	5237.4	 He did that when they no-bid them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5239.3s	5239.3	 I get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5240.6s	5240.6	 Slightly different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5241.5s	5241.5	 I get it. But still, I think at the end of the day, Bezos is willing to put his money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5246.7s	5246.7	 where his mouth is. He's offered to put up a billion dollars or more to fund this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5250.4s	5250.4	 I'd love to see multiple companies simultaneously going to the moon, multiple

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5257.0s	5257.0	 But rather than have a single contract with one customer or have private industry figure

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5272.4s	5272.4	 Bezos is almost 60 years old. He's got $150-$200 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5277.1s	5277.1	 It's going to cost him $2-3 billion, 1-3% of his net worth to do all this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5282.1s	5282.1	 Just fucking do it, Bezos, and stop crying and filing lawsuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5285.4s	5285.4	 He may end up doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5286.3s	5286.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5286.6s	5286.6	 But the problem is he's losing the human capital that's required.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5292.3s	5292.3	 So there was a huge press cycle about this one person who was the leader of the lander project
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5301.3s	5301.3	 who just quit and went to SpaceX. My point is other engineers don't want to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5306.6s	5306.6	 that this is the way to win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5308.5s	5308.5	 Compete.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5309.0s	5309.0	 He's got to crawl out of that hole now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5311.6s	5311.6	 Build, iterate, and solve. Build, iterate, solve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5315.5s	5315.5	 It certainly seems the case that his PR stunt with shooting himself into space
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5320.2s	5320.2	 didn't do him any favors either. It's almost like everyone sees the great work Elon does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5324.3s	5324.3	 when he does these PR events and he gets all this attention and publicity and gets positive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5328.5s	5328.5	 press and accolades and then Bezos does them and he's like, oh, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5331.3s	5331.3	 Bezos has no besties. There's no bestie taking Bezos aside. He's bestie-less Bezos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5336.3s	5336.3	 Bestie-less Bezos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5338.6s	5338.6	 No, he may have besties, but they're not doing the job that other besties do for other people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5343.1s	5343.1	 If they're yes men and women and they're not being true besties, they need to tell him when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5346.6s	5346.6	 he's got something that's a blind spot. And the blind spot here is he was dunking on Richard

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5362.9s	5362.9	 with like a drawing. Like I should technically get an A plus and I should be singing the solo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5368.2s	5368.2	 for the choir practice. And like some other person has like got the solo. You get the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5372.7s	5372.7	 solo next year Bezos. Bezos offered you a huge consulting fee. Jake, how would you be his

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5384.2s	5384.2	 By the way, I hired this nut. He flies back with me. I mean, he literally ate everything on the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5397.6s	5397.6	 finish. He said to me, Chamath, you have some great toiletries in the back. I said, yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5404.9s	5404.9	 sure. You know, there's Marvis. There's great toothbrushes. And then out of his pocket,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5409.0s	5409.0	 he pulled some scope bottles that he had. I was shocked. It's the real scope. This motherfucker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5419.5s	5419.5	 was looting. I looted all your lactate. We all take advantage of CP. Oh my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5427.6s	5427.6	 This other guy, this motherfucker, Freebird, once was so buried. He got so fucking mad. He grabbed

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5441.0s	5441.0	 like, I'm so fucking angry because he had lost a big pot right during poker. Then he took all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5445.8s	5445.8	 pistachios and shoved them in his pocket. It's like an Afghan warlord.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5450.6s	5450.6	 Wait, the street bird stole the pistachios?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5455.6s	5455.6	 Yeah, it's all the pistachios and the lactate.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5466.8s	5466.8	 Wait, Freebird, do you want me to prepare the house? Do you want me to prepare the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5478.1s	5478.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5478.6s	5478.6	 I mean, just as an aside, Bill Gurley was talking about this. We talked about this early in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5482.2s	5482.2	 pandemic. Why don't we have fucking $1 test, Freebird? Why does everybody not have 100 tests
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5487.8s	5487.8	 everywhere?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5488.2s	5488.2	 Binacs now tests are literally lateral flow strips. They cost pennies to make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5492.6s	5492.6	 It's insane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5493.1s	5493.1	 How much did it cost to buy?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5502.6s	5502.6	 Yeah, you should get Michael Mina on to talk about this. He's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5507.0s	5507.0	 guy to talk about it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5520.2s	5520.2	 whole emergency authority thing, we were making masks and liquid oxygen tanks and all this shit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5524.7s	5524.7	 we should have been printing antigen tests on strips of paper. We have the facilities in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5528.0s	5528.0	 US to do it. And we could have made 100 billion 50 cent tests and made them just free and available
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cyu00cyw60&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=91&t=5535.8s	5535.8	 to schools, to workplaces, to everything. It's absolutely insane.
